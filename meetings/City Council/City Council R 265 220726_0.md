| 0:03:40| I'm wearing a mask tonight because I was traveling and around little people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| have sometimes been experiencing COVID. So I'm doing this to protect those around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| me. But hopefully I'll speak really clearly so everyone can hear me. We got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| used to this and then we got not used to it. So please bear with me as I do my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| best to keep people around me germ free. So with that said, I want to make an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| important, I want to mark an important date in our country, the anniversary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| the signing of the American with Disabilities Act. We know there are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| than 60 million people with disabilities across our country. That breaks down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| one in three people having a family member with a disability. Prior to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| passage of the ADA, there was no expectation for reasonable accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| at work, no expectation that public transportation or sidewalks be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| accessible, and no guarantee of access to government facilities, programs or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| services. The city of Knoxville is committed to ensuring access to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| facilities and programs. And we have a robust Advisory Council to share ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| improve access and expand our inclusive efforts. That advisory body's name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| Cody, the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues. So I'm proud to share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| that the city of Knoxville created and codified this advisory body six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| prior to the passage of the ADA, and it has now been going strong ever since. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=301)|

| 0:22:49| a housing crisis, and what you're saying makes sense, I think it's unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| to that developer who sat and waited for us to work out our agreement, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1375)|

| 0:23:09| Thank you. Councilmember Parker. My concerns with what is before us is that the analysis to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1389)|

| 0:23:28| developer, I believe it was February of last year, 2021, and so we know how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1408)|
| 0:23:38| things have been fluctuating month to month, maybe day by day. For me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1418)|
| 0:23:49| that weakens the case for the need for a pilot in this situation, since we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| basing it on circumstances as identified in February of 2021. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1434)|

| 0:24:14| now more than ever is that their borrowing costs will have gone up, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1454)|

| 0:26:15| public. We've had a lot of rain lately and a bit of flooding, and so to put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| mildly, I guess, how is this going to help us alleviate or prevent future flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| I know I have some constituents that have had some issues and questions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| the last couple of weeks, so just wanted to get a little bit more information for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| the public on this item. Thank you, Councilwoman. Harold Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Director of Engineering. We really don't know all of the storm sewer system that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| we have and the condition of it. Usually that is determined when complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| come about, and the first part of this project will go to those areas that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| the highest flooding or highest complaint areas. We're basically, A, building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| database of what we have and the condition that we have. Once this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| assimilated, this will be used as a guide to prioritize how we put our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| capital dollars towards stormwater repairs. One of the priorities that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| mayor directed me, even before I began June 1 of 2020, that this needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| attention, and so this is the first step. That way we can meet with the public. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| can meet wherever anybody wants. We can say this is what our findings are. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| is how we came up with the priorities, so they can see exactly how we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| business and trying to get these corrections made. Okay, so they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| understand why you're doing one culvert versus another in terms of our capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| investments. That is correct. Okay, what is the time frame expectation for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| process of prioritization? We're pushing them pretty hard. We're hoping to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| significant amount of the survey data probably late winter, early spring of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| next year. Everything is being surveyed and GPSed in, as well as reports on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| pipe and each structure. Frankly, I've been pushing for six months. I hope we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| can get a fair amount of data even before the end of the year. Okay, so final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| kind of follow-up question to that. I think one of the issues that I observe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| or understand, again, always say not an engineer, but that we have some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| that are hillside areas, maybe in some of the outer more suburban areas of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| city that don't have stormwater infrastructure. Like I think there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| areas of Fountain City that do, and then there's higher areas beyond them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| don't. And so all those people get that runoff. Is that fair analysis? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| that it is a fair analysis, and it's hitting somebody. In other words, coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| off the hillsides, somebody's at the bottom of the train, if you will. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| expect, frankly, we probably have good information to know generally where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| those areas are. This is going to tell us exactly what's happening in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| areas and what frequency flooding may occur. Okay. I just, for everybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| understand, one of the hardest things as a council member, I mean, I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| staff deals with this at a higher frequency, is you get a lot of homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| sometimes they're senior citizens on limited income, and they are having parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| of their home flood due to water because there isn't infrastructure, not because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| there's something wrong with it. It's just that we have areas of town that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| built without it. And it's really difficult for some of these people to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| their own money. Unfortunately, that's what I've learned in this process is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| they have to figure out a way to deal with the water that's coming at them when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| it's running off of a hillside from other properties that didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| stormwater management as part of the infrastructure. So it becomes quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| burden on some of our property owners. Candidly, that's the toughest calls that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| I have to make is when we have a situation like that. And as we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| through this process concurrently, we're looking for hopefully infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| dollars to begin to repair the infrastructure we have, plus possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| adding infrastructure to those areas you're speaking of. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you. Council Member Smith. Thank you, Mayor. Director, I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| confirm this is public infrastructure. This isn't going to be on private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| property. That is correct. I also wanted to thank the stormwater team. They came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| out, spent a day in Baker Creek clearing out as much as they could. But a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| these stormwater issues are backed up from private property and also public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| property. So I think to the extent we can handle the public side, I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| a very good investment. But thank you for the team coming out to Baker Creek for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=1849)|

| 0:45:10| signed up to speak against this. First is Mr. Rick Roach. Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2710)|
| 0:45:27| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| The agenda item, the Edward Byrne grant application, I slightly remembered it maybe from a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2728)|
| 0:45:45| and I do remember at that time Chief Thomas being asked a question about why the county was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2745)|
| 0:45:55| co-joined on the grant application and there was some explanation given about it helps it go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2755)|
| 0:46:06| through, it has to be this way, I don't know if Homeland Security was ever involved in it, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| just not sure of it. However, information has come up and I don't know if any of you all have a packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2772)|
| 0:46:23| maybe explaining the resolution about the breakdown of the grant application. The county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| getting $42,000, a little over $42,000 of this money that's being requested, that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2789)|
| 0:46:38| their cut and trying to figure out what their complete role is as the city has stated policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2798)|
| 0:46:50| differences in terms of enforcement, such as 287G, the city technically does not participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| in 287G. If those funds would be utilized for 287G, that $42,000, how is that going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2818)|
| 0:47:12| If we're just a front for the county to get more money to apply to a program that the city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2832)|
| 0:47:21| openly said it does not participate in, this type of joint application, it's problematic to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2841)|
| 0:47:32| Also, in further reading some of the details of this application about what the obligations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2852)|
| 0:47:43| liabilities are of the county and the city, they talk about the county won't hold the city and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2863)|

| 0:48:01| violated. You need to get some clarification on this. If there's a conflict in policy but you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2881)|
| 0:48:10| joining in on a grant application and sharing funds, that's what it looks like to me. If someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| can explain it better to me, clear this up, fine, but I don't think that's the case because we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| been doing this since, what, 2017, and the information pretty much is right there in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| of us. There's been a back and forth at the federal level about, I think the Trump administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| actually went to court to enable themselves to, and there's a cooperative agreement about sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2918)|
| 0:48:50| information and funneling that information back to the federal government to be used against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| people that may be involved in the sanctuary movement. Could be other law enforcement or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2937)|
| 0:49:05| civil issues where these funds, where the law enforcement agencies involved could be funneling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| information, surveillance information. I brought this up kind of before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2954)|
| 0:49:23| The track record's not good overall, not just for Knoxville and Knox County, but for all the way up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| to the federal government. So you need to get some clarity on this, make it real clear. I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| that you all table this resolution until you get a clarification. City Law Director, anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| comment on this, be great. Thank you. Next person signed up to speak is Tina Sparks. Ms. Sparks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| if you come to the podium, please state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| five minutes to address council. My name is Tina Sparks, formerly of Vestal, now of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=2997)|
| 0:50:12| North Knoxville, 37917. And my comments, my objection, well, okay, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3012)|
| 0:50:28| When I signed up to speak, Mr. Johnson asked me, of course, was I going to speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| or oppose? I had to think for a minute, because in principle, and I hate doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| but I'm doing it. In principle, if this money was truly going to be spent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3042)|
| 0:50:53| promoting public trust, especially with our police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| if it truly was going to be spent on supporting contemporary training, CIT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3057)|
| 0:51:14| CIT, you all remember about CIT, and if it was truly going to be spent on enhancing technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3074)|
| 0:51:24| in an effort to create a safer community, then I wouldn't be up here opposing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| resolution. But we all know that that's not going to happen. We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| Yeah, the county is going to get almost $43,000, $42,949. And I, like Mr. Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3099)|
| 0:51:55| because I can't, I don't speak quite as eloquently as Mr. Roach does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| but I know, and you know, and everybody in this room knows, and everybody watching on the CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3122)|
| 0:52:13| I hope, knows, and the Channel 6, or whoever you are here, you all know that that money is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| going to be, for the most part, spent 287G. It is going, 287G is not gone. You all need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| that. It is still there. It is still a problem. So, yeah, I'm opposed to this. And not opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3149)|
| 0:52:43| okay, like Mr. Roach said, take time. Go and look at this justice, go and look at this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3163)|
| 0:52:51| had to look this up. I didn't know what this was, so I looked it up. And to qualify for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| you have to do certain things. The city has to do certain things. The county has to do certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| things. And one of the things you have to do is share information. And I'm worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| Sharing justice information, sharing initiatives, okay. So what does that mean? I don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| what that means, sharing initiatives. It says here that the county agrees to provide all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3201)|
| 0:53:31| reporting and monitoring information to the city as requested and required by the JAG program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| Okay, monitoring information to monitoring. There we go with the monitoring, with the noise thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| down on Gay Street, the drones, which I know we have, Chief Noel, I know we have drones. I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3225)|
| 0:53:53| them. And we use the words like at this moment we have no reason to think that or I don't foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3233)|
| 0:54:11| that being an issue. We have to choose our words very carefully. And a lot of you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| really good at that. And I'm not saying that in a complimentary way. I'm sorry I can't. And I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3259)|
| 0:54:31| one thing that I really want to, and I'm going to speak at the end in public form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| and I'll get more into that, I guess, because my time is almost out, because, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| I never write anything down. But just take some more time on this. What is the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3281)|
| 0:54:52| There is no, oh, yes, there is. You have a certain amount of time before you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| so for these funds to be, for you to apply for this. And I think it's tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| I think the deadline is tomorrow. It's coming up pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Council members, that concludes the people signed up to speak on this item. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| Thank you. Some of my concerns are along the lines of what the speakers were speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| And once again, this is a grant. We do not have the money. But this is usually the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| that we get to talk about things. But I don't recall us applying for grants with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3332)|
| 0:55:40| on a very regular basis. Are we acting as the fiscal agent? Am I using the right words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| Chief Noel, I think we do this routinely for this particular grant. But, Chief Noel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| could you elaborate on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| So the reason we apply through the county, with the county with this, is it makes our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| application much stronger because of the Homeland Security portion of this is my understanding. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| it's something I think we've done since 2017. We've done this every year. But applying together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| makes our application much more likely to be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| So it's an annual application that you do with the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| That's correct. My understanding is we've done this, Knoxville has done this every year since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Okay, thank you. Yeah, my feelings about the Knoxville Police Department are very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| than my feelings about the Sheriff's Office. And I have a great deal of respect for you coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| on board. And I'm excited about the things you're working on. I do not have those feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| about the Sheriff's Department. So this concerns me. Another thing that this brought to my mind was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| in 2018, the last time I really remember, not for this grant, but for other resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3400)|
| 0:56:49| that we were leasing some cars to the Sheriff's Department. And when we, maybe some trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3409)|
| 0:56:58| small trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3419)|
| 0:56:59| We were leasing them so that they could take prisoners to work or to do city work or county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| work. And we had talked about at the time that these people, when they come back from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| working all day, they have to pay for extra soap or extra shampoo from the extra work that they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| from the commissary. And we had discussed trying to get somehow helping them out with gift cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| or something. And I know we've all been very, very busy, but I'd like to work on that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you, Councilmember Singh, Councilmember Parker, and then Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| I wanted to point out in our packet, page 1094,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3461)|
| 0:57:53| under the MOU, it states that the city and the county must file a joint application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| because we're considered a certified disparate jurisdiction. I looked into this and did a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| research before our meeting as well, because I've gone back and forth on this issue. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| I voted against it in 2020 and then voted for it in 2021. Part of my concern are the politics that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3492)|
| 0:58:24| have come into this program. Some of the history in July, 2017, under the Trump administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3504)|
| 0:58:35| the DOJ announced that it would institute new compliance requirements for recipients of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| grant. And that included complying with information sharing with federal immigration authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3521)|
| 0:58:51| providing federal authorities with 48 hours advance notice of release dates of incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| undocumented persons, and affording federal immigration officers access to detention facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3536)|
| 0:59:09| Furthermore, it said in April of last year, Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| Garland repealed the Trump-era conditions to this grant, but I was not able to find to what extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| those requirements were repealed and what may have remained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| And so when I look through the agreement before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| you know, there's no clarity around how the funds will be used. It says contemporary training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| which needs to be defined, acquiring equipment, supplies, and enhancing technology, which also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| needs to be defined. How the money is divided up, each entity, the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3597)|
| 1:00:06| have full discretion to use the funds as they see best. And so while this has come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3606)|
| 1:00:18| to approve, we are not being given information of how the funds are being used, have been used in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3618)|
| 1:00:27| the past, and are planned for their use moving forward. And whether there is a commitment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| the city, from KPD, to I would say our principles as a city that do tend to differ from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3634)|
| 1:00:53| and how that will play out in this grant. So I've gone back and forth on this grant, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| continuing to be uncomfortable with it, especially because there's a clear indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| that KPD wants to expand its surveillance technology. Meeting with our new school security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3668)|
| 1:01:16| chief, there's interest there in the county to expand use of surveillance technology. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| we haven't had that conversation as a city. When we had the workshop on the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3682)|
| 1:01:31| monitoring device, which honestly I don't know why we had the workshop, because we were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| the plan is to try to sole source it so it doesn't have to come back before city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| and wouldn't need our approval. So that's a decision it seems the administration's planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| to move forward with on their own without even answering our questions of how the data that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| been collected thus far would be used, when will KPD have access to it. None of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| questions are being answered. And so for me, it's important as a legislative body that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3720)|
| 1:02:11| more information about what we're actually approving. It would be great to get reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| on how this money has been used in the past, but it's difficult for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| outright approve it without having a larger conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| about the enhanced technology and contemporary training that these funds would be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Council Member Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Yeah, so I have a question for either Chief Noel or Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3761)|
| 1:02:50| When I look at the application here in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| so specifically it says information sharing, the county is to share information with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| the city, because we're the ones receiving the money. And they need to share information with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| about what they're doing to be able to get it reimbursed. That's the way the packet that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| have reads. And it says city agrees to pay county, county agrees to use the money, and they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| give us invoices to be reimbursed. So Mr. Evans, I know you're probably not going to be on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| able to tell me, I think we all need to know, how the money's been dispersed in the past. Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| what have we paid for? What are the invoices? I don't know if Chief Noel knows the answer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| Mr. Evans. I do not know the answer off the top of my head. I do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| for grants that we receive in general, we have to draw them down pretty much expenditure by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| expenditure, so we have a good record of it. We usually do it on about a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| We'll have a bunch of things we'll put in to draw down the funds. In this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| what you're describing there, looking in front of you, I don't have that, but you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| but it sounds like that the Knox County ends up having to do the same thing with us to draw it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| down from us. Correct. What I'm saying is, you can rest assured there is a record somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| that it's rather extensive, but as far as what we've been doing, the actual things that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| been procured with this, no, I haven't looked into that type thing in a long time since I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| the purchasing agent. Okay, but somebody from finance could say, here's what we've reimbursed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| from this to the county in the past. Yes, ma'am. Okay, because it says in the grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| in our packet, I'm looking at page 1095, county will submit appropriate invoices to city for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3893)|
| 1:05:02| reimbursement, so that can be supplied to council. Yes, ma'am. Correct. Okay, the other thing is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| page 1095, it says county agrees to use $42,949 for the JAG program within the grant period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| October 1st, 2021 to September 30th, 2025. So this is a four-year-ish grant program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3916)|
| 1:05:28| that we're in the middle of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| If I may, these grants run years behind, so right now we are currently being reimbursed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3932)|
| 1:05:42| the JAG 2019 grant right now in 2022. Okay. So they run about three years behind. We wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| be spending or being reimbursed for money from this grant, from JAG 2022, to probably two to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| three years from now. That's how far these run back. That's why the grant gives us a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| flexibility, so when we do our grant submission, we ask for certain items, and they have to fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| into four categories, equipment, supplies, technology, and training, and we ask for specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| things that we want to spend the money on, but we're allowed to augment that or change it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| these things take two to three years to drop, and that obviously the needs of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| in 2025 are probably going to be different than the needs of the police department right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| So right now we're expending money from JAG 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Okay, so do we know what the deadline is for when this is due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| the application, since it's covering a period from 2021 to 2025?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| I don't. I believe the deadline is pretty close, but I do not know offhand what the deadline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| And Council Member Ryder, I would just say that we obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| ensure that all the KPD expenditures are for modern 21st century policing, consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| the priorities that Chief Noel and I and Council Members discuss and embrace all the time. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| that's the kind of training, that's the kind of equipment, that's the kind of supplies that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| always budget and pay for, and this grant would just supplement that should we be fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| enough to get it. Council Member Smith. Thank you, Mayor. Do we, I think we partner on other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| grants with the county, is that right? Outside of this specific grant throughout each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| Yes, sir. Occasionally we do. I mean, yes. Okay. Do you have any examples that come to mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| I know I didn't... Not off, again, not off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| Anybody in the administration can speak to areas where we either are co-applicants of a grant with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| the county or... I think we did one with the school. We've done some with the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| in the past on, you know, maybe some security issues and that sort of thing. I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| Well, let me add to it. I believe our budget every year includes... Emergency management is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| one. Sorry? We work with the county on emergency management services. I believe our budget every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| year... Animal center, I think. Animal center. All right. I think our budget every year includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| matching funds of some sort with the county in multiple ways. Is that right? I know litter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| one example that I advocated for where the county is matching our funds. Yeah, we partner with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| county all the time, and obviously with projects, nonprofits routinely will communicate with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| during budget season. We do budget for grant matches specifically within engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| to address matches for federal grants through TDOT. There are nonprofits in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| that receive matching funds from both city and county. Is that fair? Yes. Okay, so there are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| I think everybody is in agreement here, at least I want to confirm. We can't use these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| funds for anything other than our policy is allowed for within KPD, correct? That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| I was saying. Some green light for new policies. I think the concern is that as a co-applicant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| recipient with the county that they have different policies or values that they spend on. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| that's the crux of the matter. I just wanted to ask, I think there are probably 20, 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| maybe more ways where we match funds with an institution in this city where we may not agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| on every aspect of their mission, vision, values, procedures, etc. So we don't have to police with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4168)|
| 1:09:36| the county in this. We're not doing anything inordinate for our own policies. This is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| of many forms, although in the form of a grant, where we partner with county through other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| institutions in the city. Is that right? And the main purpose of that information sharing agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| is so when they buy certain things, they spend that money, they have to give us the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| so we can account for it because we're applying for this grant and we have to account to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| DOJ on how that money was spent. But we're not going to be spending this money to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4205)|
| 1:10:14| outside of the guidelines of the City of Knoxville or the Knoxville Police Department. And would the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| spent on previous years be publicly available or at least that this council could see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| previous grants were? Yes, Mr. Evans can share that information. And for the county as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| Whatever they've invoiced to us, yes. Okay, thank you. Vice Mayor Roberto. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| Deputy Mayor Gill, the noise camera was referenced earlier, so just wanted to return back to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| points that were made in the workshop. So if I recall correctly, the noise camera doesn't record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| anything over 86 decibels, is that right? It doesn't record anything under 86. Yeah, I mean under, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| I'm sorry. It has to be over 86 decibels in order for it to be recorded. And that's like operating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| gas-powered leaf blower. So we're talking about very loud sounds. And the focus on that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| conversations, which I can't imagine 86 decibel conversation, but it's focused on intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| modified exhaust and engine sounds. That's what it's looking for, is that right? Not only is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| correct, but it will not even, like it's not, when I say focused on it, it won't pick it up. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| programmed to pick it up. It ignores those fully. So the only thing the only thing is exhaust and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| engines above 86 decibels. Okay. And then in our discussion at the workshop, in order for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| this program to move out of the pilot into a phase where we might look at utilizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| technology, that would have to come to council. Correct. Yes. It does have to come to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| simply because of the price. It's like 27k, anything over 25, as you know, comes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| Even though this could be sole source, it's got to come back to you. Correct. Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| And then Chief Noel, in the packet on this agenda item, it says that this funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| it's looking at specifically identifying funding which is designed to reduce violent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| public trust, and enhance criminal investigations. Could you comment on how you see if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| if the city is to get this grant, how this might be used to forward those principles? So what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| submitted in our request for for spending this money with JAG 2022, and again we won't get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4357)|

| 1:12:48| right now our radios are not capable, do not have GPS capability. So if an officer, each one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| radios has this, you see this orange button on our radio, it's an emergency button. You press that button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| it lets everyone know that that officer is having an emergency. We have an incident where the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| was severely injured, he could not speak. There's a technology that we can add to our radio system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| they hit this button, we'll know exactly their GPS location and we can get them help immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| especially if they're in a position where they're too excited to articulate their location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| they're in a place where they don't know their location, or they're unable to speak. That's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| technology that we're looking at, that's about $50,000. The beauty of this grant is it's 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4404)|
| 1:13:31| funded by the federal government, there's no match at all for us, so it'd be very difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| to get that, spend that money without this grant. Another thing would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| voice over internet protocol for our radio system. We have some dead zones with our radios right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| especially in hospitals, in schools. This came up in the school shooting in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| In some places our radios do not work very well. This would give us additional software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| so we could transmit even if we had a comms failure, even if we're in a dead zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| that's something else that we're looking for. What else we've asked for this is money for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| field training officer software to help process the way we train our new recruits, money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4449)|
| 1:14:18| another bomb suit for our bomb squad, the bomb suits that we have right now that our bomb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| technicians use when they go out, and honestly, just being frank, put their lives on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| every time we get a suspicious package most of the time. There's not any issues with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| but it could be something that could not only injure the community, but place that officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| who's putting that bomb suit on in jeopardy, funding for another bomb suit. We asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| funding for software, additional software for our flock camera system, funding for money for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4486)|

| 1:14:57| like that, and then finally money for training our patrol officers and our investigators. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| we asked for with JAG-20. Thank you. Vice Mayor, are you done? Do you have, okay. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4502)|
| 1:15:15| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you Council Member Roberto for clarifying that. I actually read that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| item in some article that said it wasn't going to come back to us. I'm glad you clarified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| it has to come back to us. Okay, one of my questions was going to ask, since you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| had to develop the itemized list of what would be funded under this grant, if you could share it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| us. Since it's a joint grant, could you share with us what the county has included to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| I don't have that in front of me. I just have our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| Okay, so with the policies, one of my concerns is that when it comes to surveillance tech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4554)|
| 1:16:05| the ordinance that I would like to introduce actually creates policy around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| the acquisition and use of surveillance technology. So without that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| we're lacking policy, and I'm concerned about the wide uses that could be employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| by the acquisition of new technology. When it comes to partnering with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| the comments that have been shared have been focused on the Sheriff's Department. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| talking about the way the city and the county approach policing specifically, and we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4597)|
| 1:16:47| very public conversations about concerns within the Sheriff's Department. I didn't look up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| facts on this, and I can't remember who was the arresting agency, quite honestly, whether it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| KPD or the Sheriff's Office, but we recently had an arrest that was made, and a person was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| misidentified and deported, and the family has to go through so much expense, time, turmoil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4630)|
| 1:17:21| trying to rectify that mistake that was made. So this comment about 287G being alive and well in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| Knox County cannot be understated, and the position that a lot of our constituents have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4648)|
| 1:17:37| in the city limits is very clear on the program. It's very harmful to our community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4657)|
| 1:17:45| and I would hate, I would be in opposition to any city funds going towards supporting those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| The information sharing that I was discussing was with federal authorities as required by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| federal grant. I'm not talking about sharing information between city and county in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| carry out this grant and obtain reimbursements. I'm talking about sharing information with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4685)|
| 1:18:16| federal immigration officers and whether that is a requirement of this grant. If it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4696)|
| 1:18:23| the city needs to know that. We need clarity around whether that is a requirement of this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| and whether we have a policy or position on that matter. I certainly have an opinion myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| and I would hope that the city would have a position on that. So that is a continued concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| around all four of those items. We only know a few items that would be funded under the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| portion. We don't know about the county. We don't have the proper policies in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| Concerned about how the sheriff would use this funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| and what information sharing may be required of the city with federal immigration officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to clarify. Sometimes I think I say the whole thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| but it's just half of it. So when I was saying that we have a different, or I have a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| feeling of trust with the county and the city, I didn't mean the entire county are villainized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| making them all a villain. I enjoy, I live in the county, so I enjoy my relationship with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| The sheriff's department is more specifically what I'm speaking to. And with that, we have a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| council, we have communication with the police department, we have a relationship, we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| discussions. The county commission does not have that with the sheriff's department. They're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4783)|
| 1:19:52| on their own. So I wanted to get specific about that. It's not, I live in the county, I like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| county. So that is my concern. And then the other piece about when I was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| changing the subject again to the incarcerated people that we use as workers, and I was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| we need to give them gift cards. The reason behind all of that is for anything, they don't get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4812)|
| 1:20:20| for the work that they do. And during COVID, as we saw litter pile up and cemeteries overgrown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| those are things that we have relied on prisoners to do. And it was noticeable that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4828)|
| 1:20:35| it wasn't being done. So I want to take care of them as well. If they're not getting paid for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| and every single thing they need to take care of themselves because they worked for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4842)|
| 1:20:51| has to be paid for out of pocket. That's what I'm talking about with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| trying to reimburse them for those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Seng. Just for the record, I think all Council Members know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| that my administration, I and I oppose 287G. We do not collect immigration status information on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4865)|
| 1:21:13| anybody. I think everybody also knows that we have no direct authority over the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| Department. So to me, a joint application in this regard, excuse me, please do not interrupt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| meeting, or you'll be called out of order and possibly escorted from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4883)|
| 1:21:33| As I was saying, we do not have any direct authority over the county, even though we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| all residents of the county, we can exert our authority by voting. Every single member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4898)|

| 1:21:50| our control. But this joint application gives us a tiny measure of control of when the Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4910)|
| 1:21:58| if we get this grant, the bulk of it goes to KPD over which we have authority over the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4918)|
| 1:22:06| and priorities of the National Police Department. And to the extent that the Sheriff's Office wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| to be reimbursed for expenses that are eligible under this grant, they have to submit invoices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| to us so that we will not reimburse invoices that are for expenses towards 287G. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4936)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you, Mayor. Just a point of clarification and then I'd like to vote. The County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| and the Sheriff have a very different form of government. Our police chief is appointed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| the Mayor and works for the city's administration. The Sheriff is his own elected official equal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| the County Commission and therefore their relationship will be fundamentally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4971)|

| 1:23:18| $2.9638 to $2.1556. Move to approve. Second. Motion made to approve and seconded. Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=4998)|
| 1:23:29| Members, as you likely recall when we passed the tax increase in order to maintain core services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| and in order to support our first responders, we knew that we would need to revisit the tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| after completion of the countywide reappraisal. That is because state law requires us to adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| our tax rate so that revenues remain constant regardless of increased property assessment due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| to countywide reappraisal. We anticipated that the final tax rate would roll back significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| and that the net impact of the tax increase would be roughly 35 to 40 cents. So thanks to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| excellent projections by our finance team, that is exactly what is happening. The item before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5042)|

| 1:24:15| to the new rate of $2.15. And just, I think this is really important to note, that's the lowest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| since at least 1974. So it's the lowest tax rate in the city of Knoxville for the last 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| almost 50 years, and that makes the net value of the tax increase 36 and a half cents. So just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| wanted to follow up that that's what we promised and that's what we're bringing back to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| per state law. Any questions or comments? Seeing none, all those in favor? Council Members think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5078)|
| 1:24:47| This is such a confusing issue. I would love if Mr. Boyce would speak to that because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5087)|

| 1:25:23| last FY. Well, back in May, this body approved raising it by 50 cents to $2.9638 and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5123)|
| 1:25:33| have given us, if we'd just done nothing and there'd been no certified tax rate, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| have been equated to $158.8 million, which we needed, if you'll recall, to fund the compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5139)|
| 1:25:47| study, future increases, dealing with the pension and so forth. We carefully calculated all that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5147)|
| 1:25:56| and it was 50 cents. Okay, but then what happens is, using the state's formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| for equalization, what happens is, I can go through the math of it. I've even scribbled it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| out here on a sheet of paper, but essentially, now that the reappraisals have been done and on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5171)|
| 1:26:21| everything has gone up, I think it was like right around 37.6 percent. Now that that's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| 1.7902, the new certified rate, yields the same amount of revenue that our previous tax rate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5188)|
| 1:26:38| 2.4638 yield. Both of those, 131.9. So now, instead of a 50 cent tax increase from that 1.7902,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5198)|
| 1:26:53| we don't need to do that. All we got to do is go up 36.5 cents, like the mayor just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| and that puts us at 2.1556, and that yields 158.8 million, which is what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5219)|
| 1:27:09| That's essentially, I mean, that's it. Bottom, the part that is kind of confusing is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| how can 2.4638 be the same thing as 1.7902? Well, it's because the value of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5236)|
| 1:27:25| has gone up with the reappraisal, so that 1.7902 yields more. So we don't have to go up all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5245)|
| 1:27:33| 50 cents, just a 36.5 cent tax increase from the certified tax rate to 2.1556. I hope I've helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5253)|
| 1:27:45| Thank you. I was trying to break it down a little bit simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| Council Member Singh, I have an idea that might help explain this. This is what I use when people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| really want the pocketbook. The pocketbook impact in May and now, there's no change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5275)|

| 1:28:09| nothing's changed since May for anybody, but if your house is worth $100,000, it's $10 additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5289)|

| 1:28:19| If your house is worth appraised value of $200,000, it's $20 extra a month. If your house is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| a half a million dollars, it's $52 extra a month to pay our police officers, pay our firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| pay our public service workers, and everybody else a fair market wage to address major issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| with vacancies and turnovers. And it's already helping. Let me just say it's already helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| I talked to Director Chad West, who we had close to 50 vacancies in the public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| and now that's down in the 30s somewhere. It's helping as we attract and retain and recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| people to the police department. That was the whole reason for it, pocketbook impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| This graphic that was true in May is still true today. I'm not in opposition to any of this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| was just trying to clarify that this is something that we're doing because the state requires us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| do it. Exactly. Any other questions? Any other comments? Seeing none, all those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5346)|
| 1:29:16| please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Staying. Motion carries eight with one assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5356)|
| 1:29:26| Okay, we're moving to public forum. First person signed up for public forum is John Zieda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5366)|
| 1:29:35| Please come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5377)|
| 1:29:47| Okay. The name is John Zieda. I live in the county, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| and I'm here again about a store that was burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| It was burned by the city. The more I look at it, the more I find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| The store was closed under the nuisance law, June of 2012. Between June of 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| and January 2013, on the 18th, the man had court. But it looks like the city went in that store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5414)|
| 1:30:25| and put valves in the ceiling, gas valves, and I've got pictures to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| We're talking about money. Where's some of this money going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| Some of this money went to the Knoxville Fire Department. In the middle of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5436)|
| 1:30:44| they went in there. They couldn't have done all this at one night. It was a lot of nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| While the storekeeper was at home sleeping, the Knoxville city was inside that store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| and I can prove it. And anybody over here, when they look over the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| they'll realize that I'm telling it the way it is. I've got, I can see cameras in the walk-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| cooler that shouldn't be in the cooler. I could see cameras around the outside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5471)|
| 1:31:19| The city actually burned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| Unbelievable. Unbelievable. It is unbelievable. When the city can send a Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5483)|
| 1:31:32| or some kind of maintenance crew to go in that store in the middle of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| set it up, and then burn it and blame it on a black man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5496)|
| 1:31:43| This is what happened. My father's store was burned also, and we were baffled how that fire was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5503)|
| 1:31:52| We looked it over many a times. We couldn't understand. We didn't know that the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| Knoxville is willing to go in the middle of the night, send the fire department or their maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| and burn a business. You may think I'm crazy, but I'm telling you, the story's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5528)|
| 1:32:17| All you have to do, anybody in here, request the pictures from the fire department of that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5537)|
| 1:32:25| Take a look at the pictures that are blurred. Study those pictures. You will not understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| them, but study that picture long and hard, and you will see valves in the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| wiring that PVC piping that was never in that store, but was installed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| Crazy talk, yes. It's as crazy as saying India McDowell burned that store and died there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5568)|
| 1:32:57| I lived here 50 years. I grew up here. My hair's turning white. I never thought I'd stand in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| of any of you, in front of a podium. I always had a hard time in school speaking out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| I find myself here almost 60 years old. I'm telling you, the story's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| Unbelievable. Who sent the fire department over there? Who sent them? These people that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| there did not go there on their own. Somebody within this city sent them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| And incident number is 12-048777. All you have to do is look over, every time I look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5612)|
| 1:33:49| story and these pictures, honest to God, every time I look, I find something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| It's hard to believe. The police report says no electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| I find electric. That's how I got started. I found electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Then they say India McDowell was dead in that store. That man may be dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| but he didn't die that night, and he didn't die the night after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| And he still might be alive today, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| But I'm telling you the story of what I'm telling you, that the city burned that store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| and blamed it on India McDowell, is a fact. It's a fact. We're talking about money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| the fire department. God bless them. God bless them. I can understand anybody and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| needs a decent wage, but this story needs to be looked into. And I want my father's store recovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5681)|
| 1:34:49| because I know the city stole it. Thank you. That concludes your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| Thank you. Next up, Mr. Roach. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5694)|
| 1:35:07| Rick Roach, Knoxville. First thing, I have a childhood friend, George Kemp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| raised up on City View. I was raised on the ridge right over. We called it Buzzard Route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5716)|
| 1:35:26| just because we're perched up top, and you can look down at all the roadkill. Anyway, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| bad joke. There's a Bullard Street Cemetery. Bullard Street connects off of McConnell just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5732)|
| 1:35:42| as you come over the hill from Eastport Village. George, years ago, organized people who had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5742)|
| 1:35:51| been raised in the area and, you know, just knew of the area, probably had people buried in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5751)|
| 1:36:00| area. And he got them together. They basically just said, you know what? This is ours. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5760)|
| 1:36:11| they started to recoup the graveyard, the cemetery. They've done a masterful job. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5771)|
| 1:36:19| brought in different corporations, companies, non-profits, had cleanup days. I participated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5779)|
| 1:36:31| one time a couple years ago, but we always stayed in contact about it. And recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5791)|
| 1:36:42| you know, you just go up through there, because it's a small, tight, winding road. Knoxville has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| a lot of these roads. And the one thing that always attracted me to the area was the historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| marker. And you would know about it, and that's the Warner Church historical marker there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5813)|
| 1:37:01| First black congregation established. And the bad part about this was the public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5821)|
| 1:37:12| department was very helpful in cleanup, but there was a lot of cleanup. And when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| doing Williams Creek stuff, and David can vouch for this, maybe Stephanie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| back on those streets in that area between, at the valley lowest point, Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| up to the ridge lines up there, it's a lot of quiet space, I'll call it like that. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5853)|
| 1:37:44| this is where people traditionally, coming from all parts of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| they find out about it, and this is where they come and they dump. And it's an environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| issue for one thing, definitely an eyesore, environmental eyesore. And so George and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5874)|
| 1:38:04| reclamation group that he established had been doing all this work in cleanup. So recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| he brought in a young master's thesis candidate, Tatiana Griffin, from UT. She's an anthropologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5892)|
| 1:38:24| She's dynamite. She's brilliant, in fact. They got a lot of work done, a lot of study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5904)|
| 1:38:33| They found out probably over 6,000 remains are in that area. This is a tight area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5913)|
| 1:38:41| and I'd say about half of it is still covered. Whatever you care to know about me, I believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5921)|
| 1:38:50| the ancestors. And repeatedly, there's been desecration of the space. And it seems that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5930)|
| 1:39:04| Knoxville, I mean, we did a great, we did a wonderful job of reclaiming odd bellows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| but we've had some recent problems with that also. And over this past July 4th weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5953)|
| 1:39:23| it was just, Fuller Street was trashed. It was trashed. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| public service department did come out. Chad was very responsive in that. And it just brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5970)|

| 1:39:44| hardly any attention. And it's a vital part of the history of this city. And I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5984)|
| 1:39:54| should start considering the value that it has for the whole city of Knoxville. I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220726?start=5994)|
