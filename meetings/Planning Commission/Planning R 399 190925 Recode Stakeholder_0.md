| 0:00:30| I'd like to welcome all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=30)|

| 0:00:36| Some of you to continue an effort that started over two years ago, I believe, for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=36)|
| 0:00:43| And over three years ago, for me, it seems to be groundhog day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=43)|

| 0:00:56| I think the city council made a good move in extending the tenure of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| to sort of monitor the implementation of the city's new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| We'll try to be as efficient as we can be, given our purview and our charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=68)|

| 0:03:22| She represents the Bike Walk Knoxville and the health advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Dale Atherton also had another commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| She represents the Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| She's a member of the Neighborhood Advisory Council, represents them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| I'm going to identify or recognize a couple other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Amy Brooks is back and back, coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| She's the planning services manager for Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| and has taken an active role in the development of the city's new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| Dori Caron is our administrative manager at Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| and will be doing a lot of the work in terms of getting you information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| There are a couple staff members of the committee who just came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| and I'll let them introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Peter and Christina, if you'd like to come up to the table and introduce yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Sorry we're running late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Those copies of the recode are for the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| How are you doing? I'm Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| I'm the director of Plans Review and Building Inspections for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| I'm Christina McGrunds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| I'm one of the attorneys in the city's law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Peter's role is administrator of the city's zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| and will be charged with the task of administering the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| Christina provides legal advice on zoning matters and development matters to Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| and to the staff of Knoxville-Knox County Planning as it relates to the city's zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| As you may realize, your charge has been to serve as the representative of your constituency group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| and as a liaison between your constituency group and staff with regard to any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| or, we hope, some accolades regarding the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| Any issues that come up, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| One thing that the city council made very clear during this process is that the zoning code has to be a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=335)|
| 0:05:44| One of the challenges with our old code is that it was not kept up to date as well as it should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| There are inconsistencies and challenges with the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| There are times when things people want to do are made very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| Some examples are, the prime example for me is think of the intersection of Broadway and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=364)|
| 0:06:12| What stands out in your mind? I'll turn to Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| We have some nice old buildings there in the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| but then we have some vacant property and we have a building that was torn down and replaced by a more urban situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=383)|
| 0:06:37| So we have a mix of things there that need to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| but we also have some fine street development that's been going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| The only thing there that complies with the current code is the Regent's Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| That's the challenge we have with our current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| The type of development and redevelopment that has been a goal of the city is not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| So we're trying to address a significant challenge in drafting the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| How do we move towards a more urban style development, acknowledging the development patterns of the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=425)|
| 0:07:14| while also recognizing the more recent development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| and not making it a challenge to redevelop or continue use of those facilities like Regent's Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| I think we've reached a very good point with Christina's help and the help of some members of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| I certainly appreciate the Chamber of Commerce, CAR, and CCIM coming from the developers' perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| Joe and Brian from smaller developers, how do we acknowledge that existing development pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| but also move towards a future by the method in which we've addressed non-conforming uses in the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| I think we'll be able to do that, but please be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Another challenge that we've had is recognizing the value and the importance of our existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| while recognizing the need to accommodate more people in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| We see the trends of more people moving to urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| How do we accommodate more people within the city and maintain the character of our existing neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| It's been a challenge. I appreciate the input of folks as diverse as the community forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=497)|
| 0:08:25| and the Knox County Democratic Party Progressive Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| and those who advocate for a more dense urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| With the recode, we try to identify opportunities and tools as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| not necessarily always implementing those tools or using those tools to the greatest extent possible at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| but providing those tools and looking at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| One of our actually identified tasks is looking at RN3 and RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| and how we can apply those in the future as opportunities for small-scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| Without adversely impacting our existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| We have some opportunities that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| How we address those opportunities will be a challenge at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| and other times I think will provide us with some tools that have been absent in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| Any comments from any of you at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| Gerald, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| As far as I know there's been significant work done in just, I would call it PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| but I think there's still some misconceptions about what recode did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| in terms of it taking from versus fixing a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| How do you go about addressing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| I guess specifically the issue of people's concerns that their zoning is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| and they're not grandfathered or can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| I think that's the misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| We're trying to put information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| One person I failed to recognize as we went through is Alec Hittring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| who is our communications director for Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| We're trying to put information out on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| We'll look through the city to do a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| And also any input or advice that any of you could give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| because again we have, I think, gone almost, from my perspective, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| almost too far in acknowledging the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| To say that, and I look at Jennifer here because she and I have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| but to say that you can have an existing use and I'll pick on used car lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| and not pick on them, but as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| a used car lot along a corridor that's identified as a pedestrian corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| you can put a sign up on that used car lot that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| First Hill is a used car lot, move every car off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| have it as a vacant lot, and in 10 years it can still be a used car lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| that's very liberal in terms of acknowledging the existing uses and grandfathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| So I think we've gone a long ways to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| How to get that word out, we'll continue to use our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| and our email list to come up with things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| but any ideas that you have, we would certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| We've, I think, have been very tolerant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| but we do need to continue to get that message out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Since there's no limited press here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| I'll say that our greatest challenge is reaching those who are fearful and ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| I use ignorant not in a term of less intelligent, but ignore the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| I think that's what ignorant means, people ignore the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| and we've had a lot of that in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| a lot of fear of change, a lot of ignoring the work that's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| and not work by staff necessarily, but by the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| the time that all of you have put in, the planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| the community forum members, the time and effort that they've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| That's a lot of work, and we could not have reached the point that we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| without the input of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Those members of the public who have never been to a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| those members of the media who have never been to a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| who have never talked with me or any other staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| and are making comments on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| I can't express in words suitable for this forum my feeling about those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| But I think that's gotten too old to not state my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| Again, I really appreciate Christina in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| She hasn't always agreed with the result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| but she's been involved in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| and trying to identify different people who continue to be involved in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| and continue to work to make this a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| I think a zoning code lays the foundation for what a city can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| and helps implement the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| I think we've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| There are cases where I think we could have done more or should have done less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| but I think it's the result of a lot of people coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| and agreeing to compromise and realizing that we will work with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| and continue to work with it and get to the point where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| I'll segue into the second item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| which is the update on the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Because I fear being known as Recode Man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I'm calling it the new zoning code instead of Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| We're transitioning from our tagline or branding effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| to what it really is, the city's new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The city council, in adopting the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| set an implementation date of January 1, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| That's to enable planning staff, city staff, and the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| to get acclimated to the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| to try to understand it better for us at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| in planning to revise our processes, our application forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| to look at how we are able, on January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| to move forward with this code and to guide development under this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Two conditions or appendages were attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| One is that this committee continue to meet for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| to implement the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| So you're on the hook for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| The other was to allow for rezoning applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| to a comparable zone to be accepted with no fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Once the zoning code becomes effective in the new map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| staff does not have the authority to change the zoning of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| That's a legislative process and has to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| But we will accept applications with no fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| To my knowledge, we've done one so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| There was a property on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| an abandoned mobile home park that currently zoned R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| that was designated as RN4 in the new zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| which is a reasonably comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| The owner of that bought it the day before the pre-code became effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| or was adopted, and he requested RN5 instead of RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| because he needed a bit more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| So we agreed that that was a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| and accepted his application with no fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| The city attorney has said that we can accept applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| for recode zoning with the condition that it not become effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| until January 1, so we're moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| We've also gotten a couple of applications from property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| who like the new zoning and are requesting zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| under the new zoning ordinance so that on January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| they have a change in zoning that allows them more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| than the comparable zone from their existing zoning does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| We also have developers, I spoke with one yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| who are anticipating the new zoning code implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| because it allows them more flexibility and a wider range of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| So I think the word is getting out, and as Joe said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| to some people that the code does provide for more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| and typically a wider range of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| One of the things that we've done in my philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| is that we set the bar a bit higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| but we make it as easy as possible to attain those new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| We've reduced the number of uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| In the past, we've had a lot of planned commercial districts in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| where every project that was done in those districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| had come before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| There were no set standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| There were some flexible standards that could be applied by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| that weren't always applied uniformly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| We now have uniform standards in our commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| The number of uses on review has been reduced for basic use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| In a highway commercial district, there is no use on review requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| nor is there one in the other commercial districts for the basic uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| There are still special uses identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| when those uses may have impacts beyond the typical use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| or need additional review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| but the number of special uses is less than the number of uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| under the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| We also have the flexibility that all our non-residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| allow residential uses by right except the industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| The industrial mix use does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| but the industrial district, the general industrial, and the heavy industrial do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Any thoughts or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| I think those are really important stats or things to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| is how RECODE is continuing to increase certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| decrease certain things like variance applications, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| So I'd love to not get an elaborate report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| but to have updates on how it's going from staff in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| The things that we were trying to do through RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| reduce variances, reduce non-conformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| increase certain uses in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| So I'd love to have that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| I work with Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Peter administers the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| I work with him on tracking variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| We'll track rezonings, and we'll work together to track development applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| As I receive calls from developers, I'll track those to see what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| I don't want to put too much work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| I think those are really important things to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Sure, and I've got both of our zoning inspectors here just observing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| and we've started looking at some projects under the current zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| and comparing it to what it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| And I'm not going to put them on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| but that's something we're already starting to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| And it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I can tell you that we just came from a BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| and there was one variance that under RECODE it wouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| It's basically having access from an alley versus the front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| I think along with that, I think that's a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| But along with that, it would be good to capture complaints that are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| if somebody no longer has the recourse of seeking a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| And the reason is that there could be people who feel like they have been a method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| of dealing with a problem that's been cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| So I think complaints regarding the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| and zoning code administration would also be useful to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| We'll track those, and I'll probably defer to Christina a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| but I can't think of any standard in the zoning code for which a variance can't be requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| That is the purpose of the variance, if there's a standard in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Now, the conditions for granting a variance are that a hardship exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| We can't, because someone wants to increase the height of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| so they can get a better financial return, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I think we have more options, and I'll expand on that before I turn it over to Christina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| We have more options for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| For example, in the CH district, in the CH1 district, the height limit is 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| If someone wants greater height, there's a CH2 that allows 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| The tradeoff is that in CH2, there are some basic design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| There has to be a front door with a sidewalk leading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| a walkway, safe pedestrian access to the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| There has to be 30 percent transparency on the first floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| and I think 15 percent on the floors above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Some minor restraints on building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| but there are more options now than there were in the new code than under the old code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| but we will track those cases where people feel that they've been restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| or there are issues and they don't have a recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Right, and that would apply not only to variances, but to use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| just sort of over these next two years to capture both the apparent successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| and there may be a diminishing curve of complaints or concerns that would be useful too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1356)|
| 0:22:45| So, sorry, this is sort of data intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| but if there's a diminishing curve of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| that suggests that people are getting used to it and we're on a good track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| And I wanted to just address too, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| when you mention that people may feel cut off from recourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I think what your comment is really directed at is when a use becomes nonconforming once recode goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| and I do want to point out too in the article on nonconformities in recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| there are applications that can be filed so that the Board of Zoning Appeals can grant expansion for nonconformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1399)|
| 0:23:28| and that's whether it's a use or a structure, and that's a protection in state law too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| so we will be tracking that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| But I think that one is really so infrequently brought up, right, Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| that we don't see many applications based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| We might with recode going into effect and we will track that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| On the nonconformity topic, is there anything folks need to know about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| within the first year they can get that no-fee equivalent zoning application in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Is there anything in regards to nonconformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| anything property owners who might have something that's becoming nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| because of recode need to do before the implementation date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Are there any missed opportunities there with protections in local or state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| As far as getting the nonconformity recognized or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Yeah, or having any other protections or recognition there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| No, state law doesn't require a local government to approve legally existing nonconformity or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| It really just has the protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| It's able to just continue without any sort of direct government involvement or approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| As far as the expansion of the use or the structure that becomes nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| that's something the Board of Zoning Appeals would have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| That's an application that's filed with our Department of Plans Review and Building Inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| and uses on review that would go through the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| But other than that, they really don't have to take any steps in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| They're just protected and can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| So there's no other deadlines besides that one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| And that's two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Yeah, we made it a two-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| It was extended to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Two years for the substantial zoning equivalent request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| That's in Article 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Any other questions or comments before we start looking at the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| It's two years from what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| From January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| So it would be January 1, December 31, 2021 would be the date that that no fee for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| substantial zoning equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| And I will state that there may be times, many times when staff will concur with the positive recommendation for the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1533)|
| 0:25:43| There may be times when we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| And I think of a piece of property that's challenged by being in a hillside overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| It's just off a major corridor, but it's accessed by a right turn only, right exit only, very narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1551)|
| 0:25:59| It's currently zoned C4, which allows very intense commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Given its location, staff looked at that, talked with the planning commission, and it's down zoned to CG, less intense commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1565)|
| 0:26:14| just because the issues, why it was ever zoned C4, I can't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| But they can request a zoning equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Staff likely will not recommend approval of that zoning equivalency rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And that will take on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| I think of those that we've received, 90% plus will receive a positive staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| but there may be a few that will not, and they'll just have to go through the process, and it becomes a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| And that request is under Article 1.4H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| And I do want to point out, you know, the request has to be for basically an equivalent zone under RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1607)|
| 0:26:57| which pretty much matches what the zone is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So, for instance, someone who's zoned residential today can't, just because of RECODE, request an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| It has to be a substantial equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I'm sorry, did you say that under H that was changed to two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1630)|
| 0:27:33| It should be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| It looks like there was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Well, yeah, we'll make sure that that doesn't get inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| That's why we have you here as our proofreaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| Any other questions or general comments about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| If not, we'll go to just an overview of the items for stakeholder committee consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| And that's, you should have a list of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| I'll start with number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| That's standards for buses and commercial vehicles in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| This became an issue because the proposal would have eliminated the ability to park a school bus in a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1689)|
| 0:28:20| And that became an issue for a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| There are some bus drivers who park their vehicles in their driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| There are churches and schools in residential districts that have buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| The city council reverted to our existing code, which allows two buses to be parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| It's still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Drop-by churches, zone residential, there's one on East 5th Avenue, the Knoxville Baptist Church, that has a lot of buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1725)|
| 0:28:55| They're nonconforming under our existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| We feel that will be a fairly quick fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| We've started drafting language to address that and we're trying to move that through quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| Signed standards for, any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| If you have questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Some of these were identified, a number of them, by city council as we went through the line-by-line review of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1753)|
| 0:29:23| Signed standards for institutional districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| The concern here was that churches and schools and other facilities in institutional districts that may be in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| would be enabled to have larger signs out of character with their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| We looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| You have to have an understanding of the sign ordinance and the zoning code to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| Unfortunately, one of my goals has been thwarted with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1794)|
| 0:30:03| I didn't want to have to know anything about the sign code because that's Peter's job, but because of this, I've become more familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Under the sign code, the size of the sign is dictated by the classification of the road on which the property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| There are six properties, all schools, that are on a federally designated highway, meaning they can have a 200-square-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1817)|
| 0:30:28| All other signs, and I'll look at Peter, maximum is 100 square feet, a 10-by-10 sign, which for a school or a church is not that large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1828)|
| 0:30:38| There are six facilities that are zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| Churches and schools that are on an institutional are on a federal highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| They're all schools. They're all exempt from the city sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| We're not going to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| They're exempt because they're county properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| It's a higher form of government, so we don't regulate county properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| They can do what they want as far as we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| Being on federally, those are the Bearden Middle School, which has some property frontage on Middleburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1867)|
| 0:31:18| Bearden High School on Kingston Pike, Bearden Elementary School on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| Redsdale Alternative, which has some frontage on Western Avenue near some commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Fulton High School, which has frontage on Broadway in the middle of the commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| and Pellissippi State on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Again, all those are exempt from the zoning ordinance anyway, so we won't pursue this any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| We feel that the sign standards for institutional are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| given the additional restriction of sign size dictated by the classification of the highway that fronts the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1905)|
| 0:31:56| Can we go back to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| So you're just going to overlay the current sign regulations into the institutional district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| The institutional district will be considered a commercial classification and has the sign standards of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| I think, again, I'm not as informed on those as Peter is, so I may defer to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| but a 200-square-foot sign, if they're maximum sign size for freestanding or unattached sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1945)|
| 0:32:35| if they're along a federally designated highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| there are certain other standards that apply to commercial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| but they would be considered a commercial designation and be subject to the sign standards for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| So the only folks that I've reached out to to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| hey, you need to pay attention to this are the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and some that were in all different zones before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| So they're not going to probably, if it's regulated by the road and they're in the same place they've always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| there's really not going to be any change for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| For most of them, there would not be any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| For a few, there may be actually less restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| If they were zoned, I think, office-wide before, now they're institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| they likely will actually have additional signage capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Okay, because there's a variety there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| There's UT up against a highway, Fort Sanders, that's in the middle of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| UT was zoned agricultural before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| So they weren't supposed to have any signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| They have non-conforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Although they're exempt from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| They're UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| They're UT, they're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| The next one is a criteria for initiating the established neighborhood designation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| We've had some, through city council, some possible requests for established neighborhood designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| We've reviewed the past established neighborhood designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I think the most recent one was 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| Is that right, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| There was never an established criteria for initiating an established neighborhood study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| It seemed to have been done on an ad hoc basis, which we feel is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| So we want to establish criteria for initiating an established neighborhood designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| and then highlight the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| And we'll be working with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| That's a fairly significant undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And when we get to the priorities, I'll make recommendations on the priorities for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| Review permission for outdoor storage yards and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| Darryl, can we just go back to that, to item number three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I'm just trying to understand what A means exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| There was a city council ask, one of the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| that would consider dividing the established neighborhood into E and 1 and E and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| What we're finding is that each one may have a slightly different or significantly different standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2122)|
| 0:35:32| So just dividing into E and 1 and E and 2 may not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| We may have to have an established neighborhood, Park Ridge established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| Harrell Hills established neighborhood, Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| because they have different defining characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| So in the work that you're doing, are you receiving feedback from neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| or is there neighborhood outreach that is going to maybe happen before we do our assessment on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Or do you think, I mean, there has been a lot of neighborhood involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| And I guess as we move forward and have drafts, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| I hope that neighborhood involvement continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| What we want to do is have these criteria for initiating a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| so that we can direct the neighborhoods on what to do if they express interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| And given our task and things, when we come back to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| this will be assigned a lower priority than some other things because of the time involved and the extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| And we want to try to get some of the, and I'll explain this later as we apply priorities to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| What I'd like to do is get some of the more pressing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| and the ones that are easier to resolve, get them off the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| and then move on to those that may take a bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Can I move back to number two really quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| For private schools, how are they zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Or what is their?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| None were on a federally designated highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| They were zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| They were not on a federally designated highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| So their signage would be limited to 100 square feet of 10 by 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| Yeah, I guess it wasn't an institutional district question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| You said like Knox County schools or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Well, what about private schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Are they zoned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| No, they're zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| They are zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| But they're not on a federally designated highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| so their allowable signage is limited to 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| Which is about the size of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Just looking at it quickly, maybe that portrait there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Which when you're driving along at 35 miles an hour, it's not a big sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Or 25 miles an hour school zone, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| Just quickly going back to 3A, from what you said, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| each neighborhood, if they go with EN, might be considered unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| So I don't think just dividing it into EN1 and EN2 would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| This is something we'll review as we look at each request for an established neighborhood designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| So the dimensional standards related to EN, we're just going to leave that alone for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2295)|
| 0:38:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| In this, trying to answer your question and go one step further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| for those who don't know the EN issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| the EN allows for different dimensional standards with your lot size, setbacks, building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2316)|
| 0:38:46| and use variation use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| So given those parameters of the EN, those two major guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| then each neighborhood could have different lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| One thing that comes out is that David Nix, at one of the city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| stated that his neighborhood, Park Ridge, is certainly an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| We shouldn't limit established neighborhoods to large lot neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And I agree that when I think of established neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| I live in a neighborhood that homes date from 1928 to probably 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| It's certainly an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Lot sizes range from two acres to 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| which will be, if my neighborhood decides to be an established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| be a real challenge to come up with dimensional standards for that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| But other neighborhoods, again, Park Ridge at 6,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| lot size, and West Hills at half acre, both are established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| So just having one dimensional standard would not work if they all pursue that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| It might be helpful because I know maybe not everybody watched the 5,000 hours of meetings that happened to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2397)|
| 0:40:07| but this really became an issue at city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| when we were contemplating how to address the issue of accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| So a compromise was reached around bringing accessory dwelling units into the EN standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| by allowing new EN applications through a process that is going to be defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| to exclude accessory dwelling units from that established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| So all residential districts, even the EN districts that are currently established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| will allow accessory dwelling units, but any new applications under the process that will be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| could exclude accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| So that's why this became relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| I believe there was a second bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| You had a certain level to reach an EN status and then an even higher bar to exclude ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2469)|
| 0:41:19| That will be the process that we'll work at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| And to follow up on yours, just the tentative approach would be the significant buy-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| from the property owners in the neighborhood to initiate a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| and then significant buy-in on the standards that are proposed by the neighborhood before they're adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| because we don't want to impose the will on the minority on the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| Because of the time involved in doing an EN designation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| we don't want to dedicate staff resources and finances to initiating a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| and then following through only to have it collapse at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| I'm not trying to set you up, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| But it looks like the original EN standards were based on some level of design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| and the look of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| And it sounds like that's kind of shifting, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| to when we think of established neighborhoods, we think of something that's been there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And so I'm not sure what, and this is where I'm going to set you up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| when we're going to establish new EN districts, what are we going to base it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| We'll look back at the history of the established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| And the design standards were one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| There are design standards in the existing established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| So we'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| We'll look at the uniformity of the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| Because established neighborhoods, to some extent, the age of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| all those will be considered as we establish those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| And some of the neighborhoods will be more challenging than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| given the uniformity of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| And I'll think of my neighborhood, again, with that range of housing from 1928 to 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| to have design standards that cover all the homes in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| may be so challenging that it would not meet the threshold for an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2598)|
| 0:43:29| Do we know if that's the will of the neighborhoods to create uniformity in the look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| Or was it just a tool to get out of ADUs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| I think you have to set up, you have to have some qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| in what is a neighborhood and what is a governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| You've got to have minutes of a board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| You've got to have a board of directors of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Something to where four people aren't driving the entire neighborhood decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| And that would likely bring a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| you'll set up these strong neighborhood associations, hopefully, in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| I agree. I think that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| And this will be an interesting issue to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Gerald, a lot of standards at one time were in traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| You know, if a neighborhood wanted to do traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| and a lot of thresholds were created in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| and that's still true, that might be a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| I know there are standards for a neighborhood to initiate a traffic calming study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| so we'll look at those. Thanks for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| One other thing that I'm sure you're aware of is that there's a big debate going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| about standards for neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| And so that's going to play into this, it seems like, inevitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| And there's not agreement at this point on whether those standards are a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2692)|
| 0:45:02| I used to joke that I could ride my bike safely from my home in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2702)|
| 0:45:10| to the city county building, I'd know my time here was up because my ultimate goal was met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| Then I decided that when the Clinch River Brewing is finally finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| that my time is up, because that seems like it may take longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| but I've set a really high threshold based on your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| When this community agrees on something, I know that my goal is agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| So I may be here, I may be older than Nethuselah before I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Sorry. Humor has gotten me through the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| Maybe warped sense of humor, but at least it's a sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Anything else about this? And I do think this established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| and going back to where we assign priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| this is another reason for staff recommending this as a lower priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| We have a lot of work to do. I don't want to come to you with some of these tasks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| with broad, open-ended, no recommendations from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| I want to be able to identify the questions and at least give staff recommendations on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| On any of these, if you have comments or questions, please get them to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| so that we can address them and come to you informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| and try to provide information on which you can base your direction and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Number four is review permission for outdoor storage yard in the CG or general commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| These are general commercial, if you look at the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| are mapped along corridors typically closer to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| The goal of the general commercial is to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| Outdoor storage yards are permitted as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| meaning they would have to go before the planning commission for review and approval prior to being permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| There was some concern about the impact of storage yards in a pedestrian-oriented district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| so we will address that and come to you for your recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| on whether to continue to permit outdoor storage yards as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| in the general commercial or to make it a prohibited use, and that was the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Very quickly, we also need to take into account that these are headed towards being mixed-use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| not just pedestrian-friendly, but mixed-use districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| which does affect the outdoor storage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| It's important to understand the difference between outdoor storage and outdoor display and sales area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| The way we look at it, as a policy, if you go to Home Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| the stuff that they have out in front is outdoor display and sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| The lumber out back, which isn't really on display, but it's stored outside, that's outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| So to that, I was going to ask, are we addressing the definitions of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| Do you think there needs to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I think they're pretty well-defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| They're well-defined, and as we come to you with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| we'll make sure that we'll review the definitions as well as the use and the impact that that use may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| Any more questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Number five is temporary outdoor sales provision, and again, in the CG district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| whether something like the Rub-Eyes for sale is appropriate in a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2915)|
| 0:48:50| As we look at this, we have to look carefully at the provisions for temporary sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| the permitting process, the limitations on temporary sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| We'll provide, on each of these, as we come to you with these tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| we'll provide a fact sheet with background information and the questions or issues that have been raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| and any additional information so that you have, again, full information before we ask for your comments and opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| Number six is monitor the application of the plan development approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| particularly the need to make the conceptual plan mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| and any need to place limits on the introduction of non-residential uses into residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| This is something that we see as an ongoing effort that may not be assigned a priority to deal with immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2977)|
| 0:49:46| but we will monitor this, and as plan development requests come in, we will let you know the impact of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| For those of you who aren't as familiar, especially the new members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| plan development is an approval process that allows a development to proceed in a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| where the use may not be permitted, subject to plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| and the steps would be a mandatory pre-submittal review with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3010)|
| 0:50:19| a voluntary concept plan review by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| and this is one of the questions for that, concept plan review being voluntary and mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| then on to the planning commission with the preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| city council with the preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and then a final plan goes back to the planning commission that incorporates any recommendations from the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3036)|
| 0:50:45| I won't give the name of the property, but I met with someone yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| who represents the owner of an old school that's zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| The facility has been vacant for 20 plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and they're looking at how can we make use of this school in a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| Well, rezoning makes sense, but then you introduce a wide range of potential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| on the streets that may not be able to accommodate them in a middle residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Well, an approach is the plan development, where they come in with their site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and we start talking about the site plan, a range of uses that may be permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| and that is approved with that rezoning, subject to that plan being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| If there are changes, there are modifications that can be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| but if they can't go in and if the site plan shows preserving that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| they can't demolish the building and build a convenience store like they could in most commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| So that's an approach that we think will open up the opportunity for a lot of adaptive reuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| some creativity in the use of properties, preservation of open space in sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3109)|
| 0:51:57| But we need to monitor it, especially to address these two key issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| whether the conceptual plan review should be voluntary or mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| and whether introduction of non-residential uses into residential areas should be limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| So we'll monitor that, and any comments or questions that you have throughout the process would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| Any questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Number seven is review a need for another single-family residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| A, under this, should the minimum lot area for RN-2 be increased to 6,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| This issue came up because of the gap between the RN-1 and RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| RN-1 is a 10,000 square foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| RN-2 is 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| There was some concern that lots of 8,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3170)|
| 0:52:59| subdividing larger lots in RN-2 and creating the opportunity for out-of-character redevelopment in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| We will provide you information on this and see if there's a need for a new residential district of 7,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| or 7,500 square foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| Going on to number eight, this is another thing, monitoring the impact of the new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| with regard to the landscape requirements for parking areas to determine if standards need to be enhanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| And this is something that we'll just review as the new code is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| I'd like you to keep your eyes open on new parking lots and let Peter know when he needs to go out and plant more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3221)|
| 0:53:53| Those standards, as I understand it, they were taken wholesale from the landscaping standards that were established a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| So there's already a track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I'm wondering how you're going to monitor it and what would be done over the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| I mean, it just seems like we already have some. Has it been monitored so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| Yeah, the new installations are not mature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| And so staff has pushed back on this and said it's premature to start evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| until we can actually see what the current standards will result in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| And so I think we're just going to continue to observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I guess I'm wondering whether what you're talking about with mature is not only do you have enough application of the new approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3282)|
| 0:54:55| but you don't have mature vegetation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| So is it going to be that much more mature in the next two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Are we going to be able to do anything about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| It might be one of the very last things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| You know, it'll probably be about three years since we adopted the parking regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| And so we can take a look at some of those first installations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| which would have had maybe two growing seasons in place and see how the shrubs and trees are developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| and make sure they're performing their function as we intended to screen or buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| But yeah, we're not going to be looking at 10-year-old landscaping, but we can see how it's playing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| If we look at it and we've got two growing seasons in place and it's still pretty stark, then we can reevaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3344)|
| 0:55:54| And this is a commitment that was made with the adoption of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| not only the adoption of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| but also with the adoption of the parking ordinance a bit over a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| that we evaluate the impact of the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| And any input any of you have, whether from the development community about the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| or the opportunities for landscaping and from the rest of you on just the aesthetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| ability to park under a shade tree and the dog days of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| Could we go back just really quickly to seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Because I'm seeing a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| You're talking about either another residential district or a change in RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| And this was the direction from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Those are questions that they ask and things that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| And just quickly that we did – we, meaning planning staff, did an analysis of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| And if we increased the minimum lot size in RN-2 to 6,000 square feet –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| this is an analysis we did a year or more ago –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| I think we would create a number of non-conforming lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| which is something we tried to get away from with reducing the RN-2 lot size to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| But we'll verify that and give you statistics on the existing lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| and the impact that different things can have and gaps in opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| And RN-1 in the old code was 7,500 square feet minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| So did the increase to 10,000 also produce non-conformities like the 6,000 would in RN-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| There were a couple of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| There are some cases where the 10,000 created non-conformingities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| And I think of one neighborhood where the neighborhood –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Adair Gardens where the neighborhood requested a change from proposed RN-2 to RN-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| And that created a few non-conforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| But that was the request of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| The 10,000 seemed to be a sweet point that there was a big gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| between 7,000 and 10,000, and 10,000 seemed to accommodate a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| A number of lots in the 5,000 threshold accommodated all the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| So 10,000 was good for what was on the ground except at the request of a single neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Sometimes, though, there still is the street frontage requirement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| There's still street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Using my neighborhood as an example, it's a weird neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| It's got long, skinny lots with typically not much road frontage but very deep lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3512)|
| 0:58:41| So lots may be 10,000 square feet, but it doesn't look like your typical R1 neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3521)|
| 0:58:50| So if you're just talking about the maximum area, that's different from talking about the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3530)|
| 0:58:59| When we did the analysis, we looked at all of that, the lot width, the square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| and the ability to maybe subdivide because, again, with the minimum lot frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| if you have a long, skinny lot, you can't subdivide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| There's also the issue if you've got a 12,000 square foot lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| that happens to be zoned R2 and you've got a nice house in the middle of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| are you going to demolish that house to create two new lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| And that's something we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| A lot of issues, everything that seems like a simple question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| becomes made more complex by the different parameters and the issues associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| Can I go back to parking just one second when you asked for an input about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| One of the main problems we're having is the conflict in areas of new growth like downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| so central and Broadway corridor up central, and the ancillary blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| There's been lots of parking variances granted through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| and in some cases there's this conflict between the parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3609)|
| 1:00:18| and the ability to actually conform to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| So you have this tradeoff of do you want to supply your own parking for that particular development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| or do you just want to impose on the streets and not have parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| because the ordinance limits the number of spaces because of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| So there's this odd tradeoff where there's not a real win there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| You have less spaces, which imposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| You have less spaces on the private property, which imposes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| And the answer has been variances, but we've kind of granted all the variances that those areas can stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| So how do you think about that conflict and how to resolve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| That becomes a broader policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| We try to help one aspect of the problem and worsen another one by one of the provisions in the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| which is the downtown edge, extending the downtown zoning to just pass Broadway and central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| That does not require any off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| In the CG, you can have a 10% reduction in parking, 30% reduction in minimum parking along the transit lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| So that reduces the required parking, but transfers the problem to the street and to the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3695)|
| 1:01:43| Well, in trying to bring multi-use to that, when you bring residential to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| I think that's where it becomes a broader policy issue that the city as a whole has to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| How do we accommodate parking here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| Do we start looking at regional parking instead of saying each use has its parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| How can we work to look at the parking that's available overall and assign that parking on more an area or regional basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3720)|
| 1:02:09| Or is there a need for a public-private partnership for the city and the developers in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| to provide parking structures or a surface parking lot that then becomes a location for some type of mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| that incorporates parking through a public-private partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| And that's where I think a broader policy issue that this committee can certainly make recommendations on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| but that goes beyond the purview that the three of us sitting here have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| But I think it's a significant issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| It's a good issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I've worked with cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| The goal has always been to create a downtown where you have a parking problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| which becomes a good thing to have as opposed to having a surplus of parking, which we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| And you look at the vacant Kmart sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Number nine, review zoning map for opportunities for application of R and 3 and R and 4 zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| with the discussion about long-range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| And I made brief mention of that, but these are tools that R and 3 and R and 4 are tools for small-scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3794)|
| 1:03:25| We've tried to strategically locate, but we need to look at our long-range planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| and where places that can accommodate the small-scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| R and 3 allows attached units only, which are basically townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| R and 4 allows small-scale multifamily with more than four units in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| or more than eight units overall subject to planning commission review as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| So some parameters there, but we're trying to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| Missing metal housing and smaller scale, where are opportunities for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| And that takes a longer-range view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| We have the tools now that we did not have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| How do we use those tools as we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| So any ideas that you have are opportunities for R and 3 and R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Work with your constituency groups and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| I think we need some good examples of small-scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| We've had some not-so-good examples, and I think what you're doing down off of Tyson is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3861)|
| 1:04:31| So let's start looking at those opportunities and where can we build examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| of where can we implement those opportunities elsewhere in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| Number 10 is another one that we'll take off this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| It's a review of the infill housing committee composition and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| That's more a procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Nothing has changed in infill housing in terms of the standards, so we'll use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| We'll take that off the list and just report to you when we work to improve the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| and the procedures for that and the composition of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| Number 11 is a higher-priority item, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| is reviewing the hillside protection overlay language for clarity and accuracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| specifically with regard to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| We want to make sure that that language works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| We'll work with that as a higher-priority item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Number 12, and I'm going to move through these quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| We're getting near the time I said we'd attend, and I apologize if I talk too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| Review sign ordinance amendments as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| I don't want to saddle this committee with the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| because that's something that staff and the planning commission, if need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| reconstituted sign task force will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| I think anyone who's ever dealt with a sign ordinance up to date does not want to wish that on anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| so we won't make that one of your tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| Number, the final one is review the guidelines for subjective or staff review of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| with the design standards for non-residential and multifamily structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| We have some basic design standards now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| Working with the East Tennessee Community Design Center and the AIA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| we had some design charrettes, and one of their recommendations was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| instead of having just basically a prescriptive review based on the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| if designers and developers wanted to go outside those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| that they'd have an opportunity for a more subjective review looking at the goals of those design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| and having staff review those to make sure they were in compliance with the goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| even though they may not meet the strict standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| We hope to work with AIA and the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| to address those more subjective approach to ensuring the design standards are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| Any questions on any of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| I'm going to go down my recommended priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| and if you have anything different, let me know so I can do this quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| Number one would be number one on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| This is something that I think would be easy to address and we'll get through quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Number two priority is number 11 on the list, review the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| Number three is number four on your list, the I-door storage yards in the CG district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| Number four is number five on your list, the temporary I-door sales provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| Number five is number seven on the list, review the need for another single-family district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| Number six is number 11 on your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4075)|
| 1:08:03| Number 13, I'm sorry, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| Six is priority numbers, and this one depends on working with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| at the Community Design Center and AIA and getting their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| Number seven is number three on your list, the EN designation, the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4097)|
| 1:08:26| Number eight is number nine on your list, opportunities for R-N-3 and R-N-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| And the others, number six and number eight are ongoing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| and take off number 12 and number 10 and number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| We've already knocked out three of your tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Gerald, could I go through real quick with you just to make sure I have the order you're proposing correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| I'm just going to go based on the numbers that were on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| So it goes 1, 11, 4, 5, 7, 13, 3, 9, and then 6 and 8 are ongoing, 12, 10, and 2 deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4143)|
| 1:09:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Perfect. Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| Any comments or concerns or other suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| As we work through these, one thing I'd like you to keep in mind is this list is not closed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4169)|
| 1:09:40| If other issues come up, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| That's one of your primary tasks is if issues and opportunities come up, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| Any thoughts before the next item, which is meeting schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| Does this time work for all of you, 1030 on the 3rd and Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4198)|
| 1:10:09| Every two months? Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| Every two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| And I'll state that for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Our planning staff has a huge backlog of things to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| and this will enable us to come to you well prepared with suggestions and opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| without taking more of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| There will be a lot of e-mail communication and we will put information on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4238)|
| 1:10:50| We'll have a little page on our website dedicated to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| But given the other tasks before the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| to ensure that we have the information to you that you need to make recommendations and decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| two months works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| I don't know if the city wants it more frequently, but we don't have the resources, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| Again, we want to ensure that we come to you prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| that we get the information out to you at least 10 days before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| so that you have time to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Anything that we recommend to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| that you have the opportunity to reach out to your constituency group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| with that information to get input from members of your group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| and then to come back well prepared to make comments and recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| and to keep moving on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Clarify, did you say the 3rd or the 4th Wednesday of the month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| Is this the 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| This is the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Which works, 4th would like, 4th works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| 3rd or 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Depending on holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Depending on holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| We may move, if it's okay, the 3rd Wednesday in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| and then we'll go to the 4th Wednesday in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| No, the 3rd Wednesday is the day before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| The 4th would not be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| We've got Wednesday the 6th, Wednesday the 13th, Wednesday the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| Wednesday the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| The 27th is the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| We go to the 3rd, which is the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| When is Thanksgiving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| That's the day before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| The 28th is Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| The 27th would be the 4th Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| Okay, let's go to the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Let's go to the 3rd Wednesday in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| even though that's the day before Rex Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| And then January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| And then it'll be January 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Gerald, forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| I haven't served on stakeholder committees like this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| so our job is to come here, bring ideas and concerns from our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| to discuss and to have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| and then you guys will consider that in your decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| or do we vote or reach consensus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| I'll let Christina chime in also, but you make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| Any change in the ordinance would then have to go before the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| for their recommendation and then to city council for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| So your decision becomes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| We'd like a decision from this and advice from this committee, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| Then on each item that results in a revision to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| we'd like no revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| We'd like your recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| and then we would carry that forward through the process for adoption of any ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| or no action on an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Okay, so it goes to the planning commission after us and then to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| And this committee would take straw poll votes just because we're advisory in nature only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| So that's what Gerald was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| kind of finalizing a recommendation to go to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| That's pretty much this committee's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Christina, could you touch on sunshine laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Gerald, when do you think you could get through the first three priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| Could you get those done by the November meeting, or are you looking longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4475)|
| 1:14:46| Or the first four, first five, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| I think we need some guide on what we can complete by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| The first two by November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| First two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| And we'll try for the first two in November and then the next two in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4502)|
| 1:15:11| We may provide you information on the others before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| but we won't ask for your input into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| Just as a quick reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| this committee's debates and discussion are all subject to the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| so we need to make sure that all communication about deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| as far as what recommendations ultimately are proposed and voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| that needs to occur in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| All right, just one quick question request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Could you all email us at a link to this in the PDF of this document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I'm sure it lives online somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| but if you could just email us so we all have the raw work on the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| We'll do the link to this and to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| And there is a map that overlays the view on the old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| Or side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I couldn't navigate it very well on my phone, but the bigger format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Bigger format, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| It's hard to navigate on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| It's a lot of area to place on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| Any other questions or comments from the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Any public comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Hi, my name is Elizabeth Rowland with the Knox County Democratic Party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| Progressive Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| I just had one suggestion that's a little bit of a tweak on the EN process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| The process for establishing a neighborhood agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| and buy-in for the historic overlay and neighborhood conservation overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| are also not very robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| And as we know, the H1 application in Park Ridge resulted in a neighborhood war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| So we'd like to suggest that when developing the new EN process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| neighborhood applications with regard to how the neighborhood votes and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| that you consider doing a similar process for H1 and NC overlays to help avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| neighborhood wars in those areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Your comments make me have grave concerns for your mental ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Amy and I discussed and other staff discussed that need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| and you're starting to think like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Again, I appreciate your input and involvement throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Before you leave, I have something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Is it a copy of the past recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Because I'd love one of those autographs by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| But you can pick up one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4666)|
| 1:17:54| My name is Larry Silverstein, chairperson of Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| Our group has been very involved in this recode process for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| We've provided a lot of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| I've attended, I believe, all the stakeholder meetings from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| and the January 2019 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| So our intention is that we intend to stay involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| and we want to be involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| In order to do that, though, certain things need to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| And a lot was said in these last five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| so this may mess up my notes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| but I want to just run through as quickly as I can some of these items that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I think you said something about the agenda would be made available in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I hope that means it will be made available online and to the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| It was online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| At least, well, this agenda was only on on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| That's when it was prepared, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Well, but that's not a lot of notice before a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| So I think you said that you would hope that they would be more like ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| So I'm just saying for the public needs to know so we can plan which items are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| going to be discussed and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| You said a little bit about the role of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| and I'm not still sure exactly how this is all going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| And I hope maybe this could be put into writing a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| I mean, you've got seven members that aren't even here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| and so this is not being videoed, best I can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| unless you all are doing it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| It is being videoed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| Somebody's videoing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| I didn't see anybody, so I didn't know they were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| There are cameras around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Just let me address real quick your point as far as the process and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| That's actually already included in a resolution that council adopted several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| So that is in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| I just wanted to address that point first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| What's in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| The membership of the stakeholder committee and the role of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| which is advisory in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| and that's why we take straw poll votes because everything that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| committee does is not truly a binding decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| It's just a recommendation as far as what ultimately goes to the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| commission for approval and then ultimately city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| But will there be formal votes that will be recorded and counted and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| I mean, I attended the other meetings, and very, very rarely was there any vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| There was some show of hands on a few occasions, but there was no announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| When I say straw poll vote, it is still a formal vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| but it's a straw poll because it doesn't count as a binding decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| But you are making a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Is this group going to be making recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| It's advisory in nature, and then that's what goes on to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| But it's not a binding decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| I know it's not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| Nothing's binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| But as far as what this group does needs to be formalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| if that's what's really going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| We have an opportunity for your comments, not for discussion with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| if you'd like to discuss that after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| And we will maybe write it all up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| but I'd like to at least list a couple more items if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| So the public needs to be able to make comments before a meeting on issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| we know are going to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| And so we either need to have the ability to e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| We don't have contact information for the members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| I haven't seen that listed anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| So either we need to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| or I don't care if you set up a process where we could submit comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| directly to, say, you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| and you would see that they're forwarded to the members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| But I believe to have any influence or input with the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| we have to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| And allowing us to speak at the end of a meeting after decisions are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| made is not really what I would call providing input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| I don't know how often that will be necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| but there ought to be a process to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| That's what I would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| I noticed on the website you have nothing for the January meeting of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4945)|
| 1:22:37| There's no minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| There's no video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| So I don't know if that's just an oversight, but it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| I was there, but it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| So I really think it's very important that we have minutes that do more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| just list what the topics that were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| It ought to show what was decided in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| And it seems like our process now is going to be different from what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| up to this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| And if so, then there ought to be a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| especially for people who aren't even here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| to know exactly what was done and for the public to know what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| The list of issues that you just went through, the 13 issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=4997)|
| 1:23:25| and how they're framed I believe is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| And I don't think in some cases that they were really framed very well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| really reflect what happened at the City Council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| and that's how these issues came about for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| for things that the Stakeholder Committee is supposed to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| So I think if that's still going to be the list that you're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| and it sounds like it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| that maybe it would be helpful to take another look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| and see if more information could be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| Because in some of these issues there were several subpart issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| where on two you only have A, but there were lots of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| And so like on the idea of going to 6,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| and as you said in your own remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| you were talking really more about 7,000 or 7,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| but that's not what it says on your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| So I just think maybe before the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| you take another look at those issues and see if that can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| I was interrupted by her a little bit, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| I can't answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| You've been going for seven minutes, and the limit is three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| So if you could wrap up so others could have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| Last, it has to do with the timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| If you're only going to meet every two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| I don't understand how this is going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| We were told at City Council that changes will be made before it goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| If we're not even going to be discussing the next issues to November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| then is that going to go to MPC in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| and you're only talking about two issues now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| So I don't see much going to getting changed before January 1st when it goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| and I don't know if that's what the public thought back when we were meeting at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5108)|
| 1:25:22| Gerald, do we have any direction from City Council on what they wanted to be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| or looked at before January 1 out of this list or any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| As far as what goes to this particular committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| these items were recommended to be handed to this setting for a more robust discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| So as far as what you see on the items for the stakeholder list that the Planning Commission staff prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| these are not issues which were necessarily intended to be completely fixed before January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| Again, these were things that Council discussed and wanted a more robust conversation on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| and I think in terms of creativity and finding out what will work for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| that was very important to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| and so I think those are all things that need to be considered at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| and ones that we're not necessarily on a timetable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| And this stakeholder committee is not the only avenue for changes to recode to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| and the public process and the meeting schedule for City Council and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| things could be submitted there through the process that exists if we didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| The Planning Commission always has the opportunity to review staff-recommended changes at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| Jamie Rowe, and I live in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| I, too, am concerned about the timetable because it was my understanding at the City Council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| they wanted you all to fix as many things as possible before it goes into effect in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| My other comment concerns the EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| I didn't really exactly understand it the same way as Ms. Welch defined it there as new ENs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5225)|
| 1:27:14| It was my understanding that even an old EN could become new again, like rehatching an egg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| just simply by submitting an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Was that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| This isn't limited to just the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Well, she sort of made it sound, or at least to me, that it would only be new ENs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| but anybody can become new again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| And I just wanted to make that point that it can be anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Even the old ENs can become new again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Any final comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190925recodestakeholder?start=5277)|
