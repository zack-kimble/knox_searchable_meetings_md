| 0:00:10| Thank you for your attendance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| It's stormy outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=12)|
| 0:00:14| We need the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=14)|
| 0:00:19| We're plus a little bit, but we're short a little bit lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| Just ask the people up there in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=22)|
| 0:00:25| Mr. Smith, would you help us with the pledge to the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=25)|
| 0:00:30| Let's all please stand and face our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| Proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=33)|
| 0:00:35| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=46)|
| 0:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| And this is a little before we call a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| We don't usually do a devotional during the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| but one of my friends that's in the audience today, Mr. Hill, Robert Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| who comes and has helped us quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| reminded me that I need to enjoy this job a little bit better than I do, and frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| It must show on my face sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| But there was a --I've been reading a book that is fairly famous, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| The New Economics by Edwards Deming for industry, government, and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| If you haven't read this book, it's an amazing book and highly recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| There's one prelude to a chapter in Chapter 3, and this is my devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| This is from Ecclesiastes 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| There's nothing better for a man to do than to eat and drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| and enjoy himself in return for his labors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| So I hope that I can do that a little bit better, and I hope we enjoy our labors today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=115)|

| 0:07:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Madam Clerk, are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| First item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| The first item is listed on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| It's resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| It's appointing a member to the Knox County Personnel Board, resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Do we have a Mr. Jones here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| Mark, do we have a name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| Mark Jones, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| That's actually the commission's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| The current person who is in the position is Logan Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| And we're trying to contact him to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| He's eligible to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| So we're trying to see if he wants to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| And we've not heard back from him yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| No recommendation until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| So we would know something by, can we get something by Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| So the motion is sending on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Item number six, resolution 112, is appointing a member to the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| And Dr. Buchanan had those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I was just calling to try to get those names because I don't remember them off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| So I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| But I can get them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| And the resumes and the names were sent to the commission office by my office last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| It was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| And also the question I have for commission, would you like the nominees to be present Monday, next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| I don't think that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| So that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Just have those names for us by Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| You vetted them all out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| So I move that we move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Item number eight, resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| It's approving the conveyance of fee simple title to the Knox County Board of Education for real properties at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| New Southwest Elementary School, Brookie McLeod Elementary School, Amherst Elementary School, and Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=617)|
| 0:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Chris, can you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I think we need a motion on the floor to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| We have a motion to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| I notice that we've got the Southwest Elementary School back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Can we get that financing question figured out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Here's the deal with Southwest Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Some of that was financed through with QSCAP bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| And there are some restrictions on those bonds that say that you cannot transfer a title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| And if you do, there are penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Now, that could be a wide range of penalties to higher interest rates to things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| So I would urge you not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| If you're going to pass this, do it so without Southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Anything else, Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| That's the main question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Mr. Law Director, will you explain why we're doing this, who owns the land now, and any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| ramifications of transferring the title to the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| Currently, I must have hit a button here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Currently, the titles to these properties are located, invested in the, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| meaning as far as ownership, it would be under the administration of the mayor and represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| ownership through county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Under the statute, the school board can own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| If they use appropriated money of theirs to purchase that property, and then the title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| shall be vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Under these particular issues here, if you, you can transfer this title to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| board under the gifting segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| In other words, you would just be gifting it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| There's no legal requirement to transfer it or not to transfer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| Back to Mr. Caldwell on Southwest Elementary School, the law department recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| you pull this one out also due to the adverse effect that it may have on the bonds related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| to this particular school and other things under that same bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| The ramifications to it would be if you transfer this property to the school board, sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| down in the future, if it is surplused, then the funds of that sale would go directly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=776)|
| 0:13:05| the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| If you keep the property where it is now, belonging to Knox County, and it is surplused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| under the acquisition of the schools saying we no longer need them, then the funds associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| that would go to the general fund under a resolution we have now, which is questionable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| but it could go to the schools or it could go to whatever you deem necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| So, the ramifications would be you have flexibility with the taxpayer use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| It would be dedicated to the school board if you transfer a title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Do the schools now own Farragut and South Doyle and Bonnie Kate and New Hopewell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| And I could go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Do they already own those, the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| There are some schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| I don't know specifically about all of the ones you enumerated, but I know Farragut is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| owned by the school board, and there are some other properties that are owned by the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| We also have some questionable title on some of the schools that back in the day were titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| to the school itself, and at this time currently titled Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| And the question before you in this resolution is, do you want to gift them to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| board or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| And that's a policy decision up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| I don't really have any heartburn over doing it, but I'm wondering if the maker of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| motion is going to take Southwest off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| I'm going to offer a substitute if he doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Just an amendment to a friendly amendment to take Southwest off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Without Southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| And the second approves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Anything else there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Any other questions about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Mr. Chair, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| No, I'd like to recognize Chair Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Ms. Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Karen Carson, Chair of Knox County Board of Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| One of the things that when we deferred this last time, it was this along with the other issue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| surplus of properties related to schools specifically was so that the working group of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| and board members could tackle one of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| We did agree at the last meeting to bring in a facilitator for our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| We agreed to use Steve Joyner since that is somebody that both groups are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| He is having shoulder surgery and is going to be available on April 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| What I would ask is that you consider deferring this one more, both items, one more month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| and let this group go ahead and tackle it and try to work together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| I don't think, you know, all of these schools are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| I don't think the what we do with property or I mean, I think working that process out is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| But I don't think getting these go ahead and transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| I don't think there's any consensus that we need to transfer Southwest just because of the bonding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| It's not that it's a question of who paid for it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| But the rest of these schools are not going to be done away with for hopefully 30 or 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| So I think we can go ahead and pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| but continue to have the conversation about what we do with our surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| And then hearing what fellow Commissioner Anders has just stated, these schools may not be closed for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=993)|
| 0:16:41| Are we going today hamstring the commission of 30 years from now in dealing with surplus property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1001)|
| 0:16:53| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| You know, as I sit here and think about this, whether we're hamstringing or stringing or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| but these monies are being spent for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| So I don't think we'll tie their hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| because I think 30 years from now education is still going to be a pretty large sum of that county commission's budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| and thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| But what I'd like to do, and I'll ask my second of the motion if he would concur, I think Jeff had it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1038)|
| 0:17:31| is once the bonds are satisfied, that at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1051)|
| 0:17:40| if we could phrase this to where it automatically goes back into this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| I mean, I think the only concern is that we don't want to mess up our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| which I'm probably sure is a really optimal percentage interest that we're getting on this indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| So if we could stipulate that once those financial obligations are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| that that property would then be conveyed over to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| I think that would be a good motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| And that kind of puts them all back together once we're done with the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| It goes back into this same block of schools that goes back to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| So if my second would agree to that, I'd like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| What's the appraised value of these four properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1107)|
| 0:18:37| We're giving away a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| Well, what is it in today's dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| It's still a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| What is the advantage other than somewhere down the road that they can say, maybe they need budget money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| to close up Gibbs High and take that money and sell it and use it for education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| What is the main purpose behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| And what's the big advantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And what are these properties worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| Nobody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1153)|
| 0:19:25| What's Gibbs High School worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| I would say priceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| Okay, we need to we've got to clarify our motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Mr. Law Director, will you tell us where we misstepped there in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| Right now you have a motion and an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| To amend again, which you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| you need to have your friendly amendment withdrawn so that you can amend your amendment to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| You can't have continuous amendments under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| So how about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| How about a substitute motion that we pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| I can't do it, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I'll do it for you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| I'm putting this out here just so we have clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| The substitute motion is to remove the Southwest Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| and then have the others voted on as is stated in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| There's more to it than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Okay, well, then what's the rest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| That when once it's paid off, it automatically reverts back to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1230)|
| 0:20:43| Or we can do what Chair Carson and the committee asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Which that seems to be the most logical thing to do right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| given all the confusion about the different directions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| You've already got a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| All right, we have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Did it get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Did it get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| All right, so it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| No, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| All right, so we've got a second on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| The motion that's out there now, just so everybody knows what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| is that we're going to pull the Southwest off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| and then the rest of the resolution is as stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| We can vote up or down, and then we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| And if we vote it down, then we can proceed on to Ms. Carson's suggestion, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| I don't know whether I should say that, but I just said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Substitute motions before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| All in favor of the substitute motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Let's count them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Hands in the air, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| That was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| So the motion, all those against the substitute motion, hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| So the motion, the substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| I make a motion to defer until the joint committee comes to a resolution on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Any discussion to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Can I get my question answered by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| I think it would be wise for us to answer that question, yes, in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Mr. Schaust, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I would just add for the debate, whenever we debate it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| I've got Chris gave me the bond document or maybe the law director did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| but it's 14-and-a-half years when the bonds mature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| So that's how long it would be, what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| And so the motion before us is to defer for the time being until we can get together with this mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| and discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Amy, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I just wanted to clarify, did everyone have lunch before they came today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| If not, there's food over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| It seems like maybe everybody's blood sugar is a little low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| We're getting confused kind of easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| So help yourself to the cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| For some of us that's a constant state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Before we go on to the next item, Mr. Hill was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| and wanted to speak about legislative activities, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| Do you still want to do that, Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Come ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| We don't want to make you wait all the way through our haggling over these various topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| I don't want to do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| The first thing I'd say, if I could revise the ecclesiastes I put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| that retirement would be a gratifying thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| What I'm talking to you about is not on the agenda, but it has been the source of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Name and address again, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Name and your address also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Robin Hill, 11504 Mountain View Road, Farragut, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| Now, the morning newspaper had an article lately about acts and things being involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| and introduced in the legislature without benefit of consultation with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| As a citizen, I look to your body as being the citizen, the body that represents me as a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| for all matters in Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| I really would urge you, and it's this simple, to get some agreement with the legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| that before they want to drop something in the hopper over there that directly affects Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| to come to see you and get some understanding about what it is and whether you're in favor of it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| That didn't come to me by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| When I was on county commission in the 70s, we had that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| And the Intergovernment Committee that we had then dealt with those issues so that we never again had a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| with a legislative act being put in the hopper in Nashville, there was a surprise to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| And I think that kind of policy would serve you all well also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| And I would urge you to consider it at some point in your deliberations for these acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| and the way your committee structure is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| And I would like to say that also on another item, there's an item here in this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| about using the money sold from property sold to reduce debts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| And I'd like to just say as a citizen, I think that's an excellent idea and ought not to be avoided in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1579)|
| 0:26:28| If we can reduce the debt, we ought to do it because, as some of you have pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| creating a new program with one-time money means you've got multi-times money every year to run that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| So let's just get it out of the circulation, reduce the debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| and then any new programs that need to be established, let them stand on their own merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| whether or not money is available at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| So that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you for letting me speak, and I'm going home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| And, indeed, I've bumped up against that legislative thing a couple of times myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| So we'll certainly try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Mr. Chairman, may I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Yes, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| I agree with Mr. Hill 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| We actually passed a resolution maybe two or three years ago asking the legislature to inform us before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| submitted legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| We can't require them to do that, but we did pass a resolution asking them to keep us informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| and to have consultation with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| It's entirely voluntary on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I would hope that they would do that, but, again, we have taken action on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| and we've asked them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| And so maybe a letter from the delegation or this body saying, please do that, might help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| But they're under no obligation at all to consult with us on anything, anywhere, anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| I think that might be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Ms. Bonavita, would you remind me about a letter that we might compose to send to the delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| and we'll review that with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| And that would serve to remind them of our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| And certainly I think possibly there's no harm intended sometimes by the actions that they take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| and they just don't realize the effect of making some of their actions before they consult with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| It just seems courteous in the least that they should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| And next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| We're on page three, item number 11, resolution 205.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| Approving the annual Library Services and Technology Act grant in the amount of $3,000 requires a local match of $3,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| with the Tennessee State Library and Archives to improve wireless access points at branch libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| That was one that was pulled for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| And Mr. Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Is there anyone here from libraries to talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1741)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Rita Black, 500 West Church Avenue, Knox County Public Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| This is a roundabout way of asking a question that concerns what's taking place here is to allow wireless access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1758)|
| 0:29:29| And is there an hour of operation that's associated with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| The wireless access is on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I have a complaint from a nearby resident of one of the libraries saying it attracts crowds after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| I would imagine that there are those that do use the wireless access points outside of normal operating hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| Those do extend outside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| There may be someone in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| I believe I know the individual that you're speaking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| and I don't know of any reason why the parking lot would not accommodate those that might wish to use the wireless access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| point after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| It's difficult for the person that we're speaking of to know whether the person in the parking lot is there using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| wireless library access or maybe becoming intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| So after hours, after dark, I believe it, and especially in a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| for us to entice people to park might not be in keeping with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| Well, if it's the desire of the community and yourself and others to limit the wireless access just to the hours that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| we're operating, we can certainly look into that and see what we need to do to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| And now that I appreciate what you have had to say, the discussion that I think would need to occur among the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| commissioners would be should this be a daylight hour operation or an eight to five operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| or the hours of the library operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And I'm not prepared to offer any suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| I just bring to us the complaint of the adjacent, immediately adjacent resident in a residential area saying there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| people parked all around the library and he does not know for what reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| He can't tell in the dark whether it's they're accessing the Internet or where's Woofie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| Maybe a bad light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Get him from Woofie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1893)|
| 0:31:43| The question is, this is the Corrington location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Railroad tracks on its west, tire store on its north, Corrington ball field to its south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1910)|
| 0:32:03| and four or five residences to its east, immediately to its east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| So, there again, I just raise a concern that has been brought to me by a constituent about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1929)|
| 0:32:18| what takes place around the library in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Has the sheriff's department had any complaints on any subversive activities going on out there at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1944)|
| 0:32:34| Yes, sir, he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I tend to agree with what I think Commissioner Brown is going down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| I think we need to get law enforcement because there might be unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| You know, wireless systems don't go up and down on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| They're not built to be turned off and on like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| So, we may end up causing some more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| So, I like to make sure that we get with IT to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| You know, if we're going to ponder turning off all the county's library systems at close of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| then there might be additional staff that you've got to bring in and get them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And, you know, folks want a stable wireless platform to work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| And that is one of the beauties of the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| So, what I don't want is us to have a system that may fail more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| You know, it may be more of a police issue as opposed to, you know, just it's not a switch that we can just flip off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| I just think in time, when we do this across the system, and it won't just be Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| There will be, you know, others where that's probably happening that will just end up messing up a really good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| that we have in terms of that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Do you have a sign-up that says no loitering after hours or anything like that that's visible that says after hours if there's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| I mean, if you've got some type of an event going on there, like a public meeting or something, that would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| But do you have anything like that, any signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Not at Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| It may be that we look at, number one, signage to let people know that, hey, this is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| And then, secondly, have a fine imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| I'm just asking if signage might be something we need to consider right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| J.J., if you could find out, I figured that's what you were doing, what kind of complaints you'd had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2067)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Mr. Wright, do you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| A further comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| That was my comment to my constituent that he should be calling the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2081)|
| 0:34:50| I find that being a very few mile from almost being outside Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| and the situation that may be drawing thin resources to the area being enticed by the wireless system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2095)|
| 0:35:08| I thought maybe we need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| The other thing is there are other calls because this is not a, I'll say, secure area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| There are no chain link fences around the pavilion at the ballpark, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| And this citizen occasionally has to go and ask people to leave the ball field, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2125)|
| 0:35:34| There are signs there, though, on the ball field that say it's hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| And I think it uses the closing time as dusk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| So people gathering, it has been not a common practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| but it's been a practice of people have gathered before at the pavilion at the ball field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| because it's a gravel lot and benches and places to sit and do things that probably shouldn't be taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2155)|
| 0:36:05| at the pavilion at the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| So I'm not saying that the wireless needs to be turned off in the library, but it is attracting a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| And it does cause concern because the residents can't understand the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| can't identify the difference between good usage and poor usage of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| And, by the way, if we say the parking lot is out of bounds after dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| then we're going to have people that use the Internet mad at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| So there is no real optimum solution to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| except to address the concerns of the immediate adjacent neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Certainly, the sheriff's been alerted to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| I think what he's being alerted to is he will receive more calls now from the immediate neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| And, Sheriff Jones, would you like to make a comment about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| There's some implications about a lot of things, which I'm not completely confused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| I may be, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| We did check with dispatch and we have had no calls, no complaints of any prowlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| or people at the Coryton Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| So I alerted them that if we get that to make sure that they send a car up there and we check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| But you were correct in saying that if there's no signage up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| there would be nothing that the officer could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Someone from the library or someone from Knox County could sign an affidavit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| and charge them with trespassing on private property if it was posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| But we're aware of it now and we'll certainly make sure that if someone's up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| we'll find out what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| And if they're publicly intoxicated, we'll certainly take them to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Sheriff, Mr. Smith has a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Just for Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Dwight, can your people then get some signage up there then so when the sheriff's deputies go up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| they'll have something to back them up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Can we get some signs within two weeks, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| The next item is listed on page four, item number 15, resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| It's approving an agreement with the Sertoma Center to provide $35,280 from closed projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| and unprogrammed community development block grants, CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| for the renovation of two residences for developmentally delayed adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Yeah, I just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| That was a pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Yeah, I pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| But I don't really have any objections to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I just wanted some more information on, you know, total square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| how much is Sertoma putting into this, just more information on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| Name and address first, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Sheila Munzer, Knox County Community Development, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Sertoma will be putting anything above the $35,280 for the rehab of the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| There are two facilities, and most of it is for handicap accessibility that they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2369)|
| 0:39:37| revising bathrooms, making halls wider, just making it accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| So Sertoma is not putting any money into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| No, they will be doing anything above what the $35 will cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| We have a work write-up, and they will be handling anything above that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| We will be putting it out to bid after the contract's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Then it will go to Knox County Purchasing for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| And how many total square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Well, they're both houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| They're two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| I don't know the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| One of them is eight bedrooms, housing for eight bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| The other one is three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| So basically what you're doing, though, is using money from leftover projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| So it's not additional funds that we're having to cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| They applied for these funds last year in our annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| Mr. Schmid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| What's the address of the two locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| One is 1916 River Shores Drive, and that's the one with the eight bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| The other one is 7417 Palmaro Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2448)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Any other questions there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| Now, Mr. Wright had a question about our next one, which we were going to defer to April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| That question I asked, the law director will look to see if there are any restrictions placed in the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| So the next item is listed on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| It's item number 21, resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| It's amending the procedures for selecting judicial magistrates for Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| And that was for us before we were sent four to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| And all we're doing, four to eight of applicants, all we're doing here is we're eliminating that requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| and then just all the names that are sent to us have to be approved by a majority of the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| So that's the amendment or that's the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Wouldn't it have come before the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| You're changing the rules of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Mr. Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| I thought somebody over here was speaking too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| Under your normal procedure that it would, you can direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| As an entire body, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| But you have assigned a rules committee to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| The reason it was brought before you now is because you're going to have some more coming before you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| Let's see, April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| To meet the current deadline the way it is, the judges will be hard pressed again to make their deadlines as we ran into the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| So the commission can do pretty much what it wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Would you, Mr. Anders, would you like to make a motion to that effect, send it to the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion to send it to the rules committee and if they can meet Monday before the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| So that will be done before the rules committee will try to set that up before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Or Monday before the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| It could be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| It is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Do it during?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Before chairman's lunch or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Probably before chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| What do we have on our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| What do we have for the luncheon, Joey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Do we have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| We don't even have anything but food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| That's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| So why don't we just do it during the luncheon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| It's up to the chairman of the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Who is chair of rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| So we'll do that during lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Item number 22, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| It's expressing support for the former Lakeshore Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Institute property to remain publicly owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Can we hear a motion and then we'll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| In a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| This is, again, I don't know how much impact these resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| we send to Nashville have, but nevertheless, I was, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| requested by a lot of friends and constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| My son grew up playing soccer there and baseball there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| And I exercise there five or six days a week and live about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| half a mile from Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| And I just wanted to respond to the constituent's request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| it remain in public hands, in the public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| It's a long story what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| There's a 99-year lease, which with the city, which I think 83| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| years of that remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| So it's a relatively small part of the park that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| But if any of you have been there, you know it would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| million-dollar lots if it were developed with the views of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| mountains and Laconne and the river and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I don't know that this goes anywhere in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| As a courtesy, I did call my representative, which is Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| He's the sponsor of this bill in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| And I think Stacey Campfield is the sponsor in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| He said he would relay my concerns to Stacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And I was just one of the requests that this remain, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| in the public domain so that it can be used as a park, hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| in perpetuity, but at least for the duration of the city lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| which is another 83 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Again, there's several different pieces of the puzzle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| But I hope that it will remain a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| You know, there was a quid pro quo here a couple of years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| The state wanted to put a cemetery in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| And that wound up, an expansion of the Lions View Cemetery, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| that wound up in East Knoxville, I think off of John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| And the park was able to remain a park and not a park slash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| But, again, there are a lot of moving parts to what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| And my desire would just be that it remain a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Of course, it's in Commissioner Owenby's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| And I hope he will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| I don't know if he can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Nevertheless, that's where I'm coming from on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| He seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Mr. Hammond, has the city taken action on this, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| The action they're taking, I believe, is discussions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Larry Martin, their former deputy mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| I think he's been assigned this portfolio by the governor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| try to resolve it favorably with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| But that's all I know is what I've just heard around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| courthouse and read a little bit in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Is the state wanting to sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| I mean, is that the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| The bill is to privatize what is not under the city lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| I don't know what portion it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Say 50% of it is leased to the city currently for 83 more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| But the other 40 or 50-odd percent could be theoretically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| privatized and sold and developed as very exclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I'm just wondering, then, would the sale of that property go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| the state or to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| I believe it would go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| What's being debated now, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| It's the state, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Mr. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| I could probably be corrected on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I believe the city takes over March 31st, which is next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| and then they're leasing part of it back to the state for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| certain buildings that the state is going to remain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| So that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Thank you, Mr. Shouse, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| I think that's a majority opinion, most people in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| County, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| The next item is number 23, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| This resolution is providing for proceeds of sale of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| surplus properties to be applied as provided under state law with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| a preference to reducing the Knox County taxpayers' debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Properly brought before us and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| I'd like to introduce a substitute motion in that, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| Commissioner Wright referred to earlier, about tying our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| We don't know what's around the corner, five years, ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| twenty years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| As long as we can handle these on an individual basis as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| come up at the time, my motion would be that when this comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| that it's brought before the Commission for a decision at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| that point on each individual item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| It's been changed since the last time we were going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2977)|
| 0:49:37| It's been changed to that, reflect that, since the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| time we had discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| It was last time it was an ordinance, I believe, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| time it's been changed to preference instead of obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2990)|
| 0:49:50| I'm pretty correct in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| It says preference here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Yes, but it doesn't address Commissioner Brown's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| I mean, there's still, it will come before us, but if we pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| this, it will still be a preference to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| It's a preference, not an obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| This is like writing your signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| We're just writing ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Mr. Brown, do you still got your sub motion out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| Well, you know, words have a way of changing meanings over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| years, and I still, if I can get a second, fine, but I still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| prefer that they be brought on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Would you like to speak to it now, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| You know, and I'll second that one, but I was really maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| hoping for a deferral on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| But I just think that it's more than us writing the state a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I mean, it's saying that that's what we're preferring right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| I mean, we're writing ourselves a letter, and that's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| We're trying to convince ourselves of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| And I don't think this is the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| I think it should be done on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| When a piece of property come up, let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| That's what we're being paid for, ladies and gentlemen, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| know, to make tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Maybe one time it should go this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Maybe another time it should go another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| But for us to say, you know, forever that we're looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| always pay down the debt, you know, we're a complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Sometimes it will be a good thing, probably most times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| But there might be a time where there's a great thing out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| that needs some capital outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| We have this piece of property, and it can make us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| boom, it can bring a lot of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| So we just don't know what the tea leaves are right now to even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| try to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| So for us to cast this net, and it will be a net, so then if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| something comes up, we will have to drag ourselves through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| Well, we know in 2013 we said we would never do this, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| don't want to do this, that we always want to pay down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| And I just don't think that's a wise thing to do at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3140)|
| 0:52:20| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Looking at this, Mr. Commissioner McKenzie, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| agree with what you're saying, I don't want to tie our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| but it says with a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| So it doesn't say that we're going to, it just says that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| just giving us an option with a preference to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| Well, remember what I said a minute ago that words have a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| of changing meanings over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Preference could suddenly mean that's what we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| And I've been around this world long enough to see things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| So I just say we don't tie it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Leave it loose enough to where we can deal with it as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| situation dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Suppose that some major catastrophe comes and destroys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| 50 of the sheriff's police vehicles, and he's got to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| them in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| And we happen to have a piece of property here that John Doe is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| looking for, for some kind of development or a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| industry, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| And we could sell that property and buy the cars, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| But this doesn't tie our hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| It says with a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| It doesn't say have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I know, but I'm just telling you what preference is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| mean something different 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Chris is fixing the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Mr. Caldwell, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| If it helps to clarify things, you could, after fifth line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| down, put a period after a law and take away the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| Just say as provided under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| We know there's a TCA code that says any sell of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| property goes back to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| We could do that because then if we had a preference to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| that toward debt, it would just be a transfer toward our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| And that transfer would be approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| And that would get you in line with TCA code and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| would serve both purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Because as we sold surplus property, then if we didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| it just to be in the general fund and we wanted it to pay off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| debt, then we could just do a transfer over and put it toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| a bonding issue that is callable, that is out, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| may want to pay off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| And we always like you to help us with our financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| conundrums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3308)|
| 0:55:08| I like that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Because what I think it also does, it keeps that commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| and I will call it a commitment that we have with the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| board, that we would discuss things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| So right now, we're just following the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| We're doing what the state code tells us to do, put it back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| the general fund, and then we'll deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| So that keeps that conversation that we're going to have in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| next month or so with the school board about this and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| property issue still relevant and on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| I don't know what we would have to do for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Mr. Brown, would you be willing to accept that as a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| amendment and just what Chris suggested, put a period right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| after the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| And the second agrees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3359)|
| 0:55:59| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| Item number 24, ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| This is amending chapter 2, article 10, division 2 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Knox County Code by adding a new section 2-774 previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| reserved to establish hiring preference for military veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| in the Knox County Personnel Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| This amends ordinance 0-02-7-101 adopted August 26, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| I don't think we need to be spending a lot of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| It's very clearly that this is not only something we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| do, it's the right thing to do also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| If we have equally qualified people, there's no reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| veterans that have done so much for so many shouldn't get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| I'm not going to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Okay, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| The only question I have is, and just kind of making sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| cover all our bases, the question is for the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| director, have you reviewed this policy and you find it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| defendable and if there is an equal, some kind of lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| I just, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| I think veterans make great employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I just want to make sure we're within our legal bounds and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| it's written and we're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Under the current policy, the way it's written, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Dr. Briggs stated it exactly, all things considered equal, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| can give a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| It's our hiring policies and our hiring procedures that are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| amended here are a little different than the ones that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| at the state or some federal agency that has a numerical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| value and you give a point preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| So all this is saying that everybody has made it to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| point and it's equal that Knox County will give preference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| the people who have served our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| And I think that that's highly defendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| I think we won't have any problem with it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Okay, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| I'm sorry, my light was on for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| All right, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Page 7, item number 25, ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| It's to amend Knox County Code, chapter 26, article 5, entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| stormwater management in order to authorize the director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3505)|

| 0:58:31| regulations in section 26-153.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| This amends ordinance 0-07-12-101 adopted January 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| 2008 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Dwight, would you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| I've got a question or two and I see Mr. Hammond also does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3527)|
| 0:58:55| Go ahead, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Yes, Dwight, the term reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| It would determine reasonable fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Would that be you or any future director of engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| We used as an index the existing fee structure from the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Department of Environment and Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| But the law director's office recommended we just leave it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| within the framework of the current director's supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| so that if TDEC changed their fee structure and we felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| it was excessive in any direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| we'd have the authority to set it at a place we thought was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| So it seems to me that we're giving the director kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| carte blanche to set the fees, regardless of what those fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| They may be considered unreasonable to some and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| reasonable to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| So do you have a --" would the mayor look at these or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| just basically under the prerogative of the director to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| set what these fees would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| No, sir, the mayor would look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| And there is a legal framework that Daniel Sanders referred us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| to because I brought up the same consideration when we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| And, frankly, I'm not a lawyer and so I really couldn't speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| But Daniel had a legal framework under which he said it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| prevent either myself or any future director from setting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| fee structure that was either excessively high or excessively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Mr. Armstrong may be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| But I wouldn't want to quote Daniel because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| it was certainly beyond my knowledge of that level of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Greg, that's my only concern, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| is this term reasonable and we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| having one person who's kind of setting what those fees may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| The way it's currently structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| and I really don't want to speak for Daniel either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| but the way it is currently done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| the state has a fee structure that they have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| And I believe the initial stormwater fee was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| something like 80 percent of the existing indexed structure fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| The concern that we had was if they lower their fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| then we may, if we rule here that it's 80 percent and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| lower their fee, or they say no more fees are charged because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| now the local governments are handling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| then it would leave a really unreasonable fee of zero for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| them to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| So within the index of the current existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| like sometimes we say it can't fall below 80 percent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| 2013 level, then that would be a reasonable fee or above the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| maximum of this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| I think that's what Daniel has in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| If either a citizen felt that the fee was so low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| and you may have addressed this with what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| the law director may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| If either a citizen felt that the fee was too low and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| covering some of what it should or a developer felt the fee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| so high, do they have a right of appeal to a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| or to someone, or is it just set by the mechanism that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| described either in the ordinance or by the director or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| by the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| I would think if someone thinks that it's an unfair fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| I would think it's prescribed by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| I would caution you not to become overly concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| this, though, because what we have done is taken TDEC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| existing fee structure, which all members of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| community are already paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| We've set our fee at 80 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| I will tell you we're right now the only jurisdiction I'm aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| of that has actually reduced the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| The other jurisdictions that are going forward with qualifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| local programs that have already determined a fee structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| for the most part, are going forward at 100 percent of TDEC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| existing fee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| We don't think that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| We think that we can balance the public's interest at 80 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| But it is a fee that folks are already accustomed to paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| The main distinction here is that it's simply going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| different name on the check and the fee is going to be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| by 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| I guess that's my question, too, Dwight, is why not 100 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| Well, Commissioner, from our standpoint, and I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| back up just a little bit because there's so much interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| in the fee structure that I'm afraid we're losing sight of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| larger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| For those of you that may not recall, basically what being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| qualifying local program represents is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Currently, if you go forward to develop a subdivision, you apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| to the State of Tennessee for license under their Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| General Permit for a SWP, Stormwater Pollution Prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| Plan, and a Notice of Coverage that lets you go forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| begin work on your subdivision, grading, moving earth, building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| doing the things that you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| At the same time, you apply to Knox County Stormwater Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| for a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| You come in for a plans review process and we examine and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| inspect your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| At the same time, TDEC is doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| Under the standards of the qualifying local program, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| this means is the state has so much confidence in our program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| that they're no longer going to issue their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| They're going to take a step back and let us issue their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| permits, let us conduct the only inspections on these sites, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| vest us with the sole responsibility for maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| all of these sites, which some, as you know, are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| environmentally sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Some of them have implications for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| constituents you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| So it's a huge vote of confidence on the part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| state for Knox County Stormwater Management Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| They're willing essentially to cede their oversight to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| let us take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| We have historically not charged a fee for our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| TDEC has always charged a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Different jurisdictions do it different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| The City of Knoxville does charge a stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| fee for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| It's my understanding that they are also going to charge the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| TDEC fee, so they're going to be charging their fee and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| state's fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| In our case, since we haven't historically charged a fee, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| felt a good starting place was to take the state's fee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| reduce it to reflect what we think are some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| efficiencies that we can gain from our existing operation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Again, if I could, I'd just like to take this minute not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| redirect the discussion from the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| The fee will answer any question about it that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| But what this represents is the state of Tennessee's confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| in your program to the level that they are willing to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| back and cease issuing permits and cease doing inspections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| trusting us to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| And we're very, very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| I think that is very commendable that they would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And they show confidence in your all's ability to do that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| they have in a few other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| It's not everybody in the state that gets this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| But also, just the fact that we're talking about areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| are undeveloped that are going to be developed and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| that you are initiating a new program, if you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| opportunity to recover as much money as you can from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| permitting process, it just seems like you would go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| I just, you know, I am just concerned that we don't repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| mistakes out of a failure of having resources that we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| historically in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| You understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| So, I just don't understand why if you didn't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| opportunity for 100% recovery of fees, you wouldn't just go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| ahead and grab that while you have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| Well, the best answer I can give you, Commissioner, is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| It's a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| These are sunk costs for us already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| We've been in this business for a long time, doing this for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| long time, obviously doing it well because the state has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| placed their confidence in us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| In terms of establishing what our actual soft costs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| personnel, plus our hard costs, overhead, vehicles, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| that, and then attempting to assign those costs to new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| inbound projects, that's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| Ask me a year from now, I think that we'll know a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| more about what our costs for management of a particular site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| We may find 80% is a little bit low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| We might find it's a little bit high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| We may find that it's exactly where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| So, to some extent, it's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| We don't really know until we start seeing revenues come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| and manage these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| So, if things did, if it did turn out to be a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| unwieldy in terms of this 80%, you could come back and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| could say, we've got to reevaluate how we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| We didn't anticipate these types of costs in this part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| program, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| And you'd be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| He doesn't have to come back if this is the way this is read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| As it's presently worded, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| we would not come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| We would have the discretion to go up and go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| on those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Again, I don't necessarily think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Well, that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4089)|
| 1:08:09| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| You understand where my sensitivity is about water and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| water issues in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| And they'll be there until I'm dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| So, I'll keep pushing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| And this one thing I would make mention of is that if we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| charge a fee at all, which has historically been our practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| but given that T-DEC was charging a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| it seemed our best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| If we were to continue to provide the service without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| charging a fee, it is in effect a public subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| It's a taxpayer subsidy of private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| If that's the will of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| then you could vote accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| But normally those sorts of things are handled through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| pilots and TIFs and alternative methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| But in essence, if we were to go forward under the new model of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| qualifying local program and not charge any form of a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| it is a public subsidy of private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| And that historically has not been the widespread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| will of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Thank you, Mr. Vanderbate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Okay, with that motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Item number 26 is consideration of the closure of Jennings Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| and Parrott Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| The roads are located off of Howe Road in Commission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4168)|
| 1:09:28| The property owners are Barry and Joy Bolton and Michael and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Linda Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| Mr. Wright, would you like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| First, could we ask if there's anyone here in the audience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| wants to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4188)|
| 1:09:48| Is there anyone that would like to speak to Parrott Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| Howe Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| My name is Scott Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| I'm an attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| My address is 5616 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| I'm here with the owners of the property, Mr. Ellis and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| They own adjoining farms beside each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| And these are public roads that are really not necessary for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| access of any adjoining property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And unfortunately, these roads have been used for illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| dumping purposes and vandalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And so, collectively, the owners of the property are requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| that they be closed so that they can stop this from continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| on their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| And to get us in order, I move that this be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| And I would then like to call on Dwight Vandervate if he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| speak to the issue of this road closure also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4248)|
| 1:10:59| I believe in this case I did the smartest thing I could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| which was to send Jim Snowden out to do a site visit as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| as Brian Hubs, your director of highway maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| And I believe both of them concurred that closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Will this involve being resurveyed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| Well, it certainly would on the part of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Knox County wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| That's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| Yes, but it would on the part of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| The property owners have already done a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| And so we will provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| And we have already provided that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| There's one little section we've got to get resurveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| But we have bared the expense of getting the property surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| that will be quick claimed to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| I notice that this is like Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| It's in Hamlin County or Jefferson County or some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| county other than Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| I say that tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| This is a very rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| And you're stating that no one is affected by this except these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| two property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| We have one that's in Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| And she signed a consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| She's out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| And she signed a consent that she's okay with the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And we'll provide that to the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Has access from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| She has access from Howell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Again, as I say, I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Motions before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Just made one mistake there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| There is those people doing the illegal dumping are affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4343)|
| 1:12:23| But other than that, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4348)|
| 1:12:28| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4358)|
| 1:12:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Line item transfers are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4361)|
| 1:12:53| The next item is a resolution that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| It's resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| It is expressed in support of resolution number 13-02-008 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| the Blount County Commission to oppose the back country camping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| fee for Great Smoky Mountains National Park to oppose the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| imposition of any fee for the use of the Great Smoky Mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| National Park that is not directly associated with the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| of amenities or a commercial purpose and to demand immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| repeal of the back country camping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Okay, I received a letter both from the chair of the Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| County Commission and from another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| I don't know whether you all received those letters or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| But this was a request of them to oppose these fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| And so this resolution basically comes from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| Their Blount County Commission, they're requesting that several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| counties around East Tennessee support them in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| And so that's the reason for the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| You know, I found this resolution disturbing in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| you know, we come from a region of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| smaller government, come from a region of, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| let's let the folks coming in take care of the amenities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| they have, you know, let's let the tourists that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| using these facilities take care of those facilities as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| you know, spending that money locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| And this, to me, kind of flies in the face of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I mean, government is shrinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| I mean, we've been asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| That's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| And this isn't an outcome of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| You know, pretty much every other national park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| I just drove through the, not just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| a few years ago drove to the Grand Canyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| You can't get in there without paying a huge sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| I mean, you know, their national treasures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| like the Great Smoky Mountains, and they have to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| I mean, the staffing levels associated with keeping a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| like that up and running are tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| And I just think we've come to the time of we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| underwrite that with 100% of our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| That's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| So while I understand no one likes change, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| it's been free since, you know, FDR, I think I'm quoting right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| opened up the park, but we've come to a state in our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| you know, economic situation in our country to where those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| things that have been taken care of at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| at the federal level aren't being taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| And we're probably going to see more of these type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| things come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| So I don't think $4 is a tremendous expense for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| going on vacation or going to do this backcountry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| I mean, think of someone gets lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| and that's what you have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| If one person gets lost in ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| this $4 fee is not going to cover what that cost is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| So, you know, there's a lot of things that factor into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| And, again, while my heart goes out to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| and the mayor of Blount County and Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| but I just think that this is not wise for us to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| And I think we're just going to start seeing more of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| things coming in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion to approve so we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| it properly in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| So go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| You know, sometimes, and I don't disagree with anything you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| on this, and I wouldn't be opposed necessarily to the $4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| fee, but there may be more to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| and I don't think our law director would have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| information, but on some of those properties where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| property owners sold this thing back in the 1930s to form the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| National Park, part of the agreement is that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| access to the park and there wouldn't be any fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| I don't know if that applies to all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I don't know if that applies to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| the part that's over there around Fontana Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| But, you know, if there was a promise by the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| and that was part of the condition that the people gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| their property or sold their property to the National Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| that they would have access to their family graveyards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| to the different places to use their former property without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| paying a fee, and now the government is reneging on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| I may have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| And I know in some areas they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| and that would be my objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| I don't think we have access to that information about what these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| details are here, but I did read something in the paper about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| I didn't research it before we came in here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| but I know that has been the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| It's not just that they're charging a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| but that there were promises made to the property owners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| they could have access to their property and that everyone could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| have access to their property if they sold it to the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| for the National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| And now it's like the government is reneging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| Well, I mean, I didn't necessarily see that in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| resolution, that line of logic associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| This is just an outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| I know that is, but I believe that that's what part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| argument has been all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| We don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Well, then, I'd like to introduce a substitute motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| defer this until those things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| I'm betting that the government has a bunch of lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| and they probably thought through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| But I'd like to introduce a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| You want to defer or you want to send it without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| and see what we can find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Okay, without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| And I'm just my point is, and I do occasionally do backcountry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| and I think it is a very nice thing to not have to pay a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| for backcountry per night, all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| But I'm also deferring to the wisdom of the Blount County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| folks that are involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| That's a lot closer to them, given the proximity of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| Blount County and to the park compared to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| So we'll try to find some more information out before Monday on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| this, and I'll give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Jolie, can we give, we'll give the Blount County folks a heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| up that it's gone without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| and could they give us some more information relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| And that will be, we'll put that off until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| The next item is Resolution 906, which was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| It's authorizing the Knox County Board of Education to appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| from its surplus funds or reallocate previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| appropriated funds in the general purpose school fund for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| fiscal year 2012 through 2013 to support the hiring, training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| and equipping of additional school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| Okay, let's, before we get on this one, let's hear a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| and get it started properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| Can you hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| I'll make a motion to approve, and I reserve the right for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| first comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Oh, you'll get that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Can I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Okay, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| There's not a person sitting here at this table in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| audience watching at home anywhere that doesn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| concerned not only for your kids' safety but today for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| own safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| We spend a lot of money in this country for safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| J.J., David Roush with Knoxville Police Department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Sheriff's Department, we have a lot of guys out there that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| working 24-7 being sure that you and I have that help when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I'm saying that to say this, that my position to this, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| speaking for myself, is not, I mean, my position to taking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| from our funds rather than their funds, is that I'm not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| assert responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| But parents take their kids to school at 7.30, 8.00 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| morning, leave them until 5.00, 4.30, whatever in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| If you put your child in daycare somewhere, there's a responsibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| that daycare for the safety of that child while it's the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| We all have responsibilities for each other's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| You may walk down any street and watch the people around you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| are so far up over and above wherever out there in left field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| they don't know what's going on around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Nowhere, nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| We've come to a point where that, you know, I was accused of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| saying, what a ploy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Well, sometimes we take an incident like what happened in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| Connecticut and use that to pull on somebody's heartstrings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| But I equate this just like everybody up here and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| out there has a family budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| If Dave Rout over here, he's saving money for a vacation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| he's got $10,000 in that vacation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| Well, a storm comes through and it blows my roof off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| Well, it blows his roof off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Rather than him taking his money and fixing his roof, he calls me up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| and says, Mike, how about a loan of $5,000 so I can fix my roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| It's the same principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| We have, as this part of the county, we have a rainy day fund for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| emergency systems, things that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| This $220,000 is .009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| That's .009 percent of what they have in their rainy day fund with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| And I think it is utterly ridiculous to come to us in midyear for such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| piddling little request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| Again, I'm not against the safety issue, but that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| Okay, thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah, I think, you know, I talked to Dr. McIntyre yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| And when this first proposition was brought up, you know, it was said that they wanted us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| allocate the funds to show a vote of confidence in next year's budget for having an armed guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5029)|
| 1:23:59| in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| And I have said publicly that I am for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| And, you know, this one really, I've tried to be an open ear to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| and tried to be that person that listens and understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| You know, this right here was hastily added to their budget or their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| And, you know, when they could have called each of us individually or had our co-representatives on the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| board call us and say, hey, how do you feel about next year's security measures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| I think the mayor has even said, let's have a discussion about security needs for next year in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| And so everybody is on the same table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Everybody is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| And so, you know, if you need my vote of confidence, don't tell me to vote for $219,000 because it's for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5086)|
| 1:24:55| Call me and say, hey, this is what we're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| What do you think about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| I have never changed my vote to anyone without notifying them of why I've changed my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| And I've had a record of doing that with pretty much everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| I can't remember a vote I've changed that somebody didn't know that had knowledge of it if they were affected by that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5110)|
| 1:25:17| And so, you know, I had a discussion with Ms. Sepposy, and we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| And she showed me a spreadsheet where the school system has they have multimillion dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| and they've allocated some needs to those multimillion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| And even with those needs that they've allocated, they've got $5.7 million above the state requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| And so if you go on the 5.7 number, not the $20 million number, what's the difference in 5.7 and 5.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| Take a leadership position, vote to spend the $200,000 after you talk to your commissioners about next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| Now, it doesn't make sense for them to vote to spend the $219,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| if they don't have our confidence in us to vote for their security needs of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| But ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Don't just vote on it and then send us a letter and tell us, you know, we're not going to we need your vote of confidence on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| It's the only reason we're sending it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| You know, we could have spent our own money, but just do the right thing and reach across the table and call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| This is an unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| We're getting nowhere with our relationships due to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| This thing right here is the reason that the commission and the school board can't have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| And I think it's, you know, I support them spending the money and I support what Mr. Brown is trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5190)|
| 1:26:39| But just pick up the phone and call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| It's not difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| Okay, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Hey, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| It sounds like another item to add to our agenda, April 10th, when we have the facilitator, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| I want to ask some questions about the hiring and the people that are going to be carrying guns in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| And I don't know if maybe Sheriff Jones would be the person to answer the question or not, or someone from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| Where I'm coming from is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| We're going to be training additional school security people to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| They will be carrying weapons in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Over the last couple of years, we've had instances where a couple of security people pull guns on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| We had a situation at a jewelry store where a security person actually pulled a gun on some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| that were having a squabble in the parking lot and actually one of them was shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| And so I guess my question has to go with the training and then the even above and beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| Once they're hired, the process that we'll be using to make sure that these 88 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| or however many people we're looking at are going to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| And then I guess another question I have is, I hate to admit it, but when I was in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| I was in a couple of fights and I asked the question the other day of someone that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| what type of weapons are there going to be in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| And they said they're going to be carrying Glocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| And I said, well, are we going to have tasers or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| And they said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Well, I guess my next question is, and I'm throwing all these together so you can respond all at one time, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| let's say that you have a disturbance in a high school or a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| And, you know, people do tend to have disagreements and there are fights that break out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| I can see a school security officer pulling a weapon on a student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| and we're going to get in all kinds of issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| So I don't think that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| But I have had people ask me these questions of, okay, if we're going to be putting people with guns in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| and I'm in support of this, by the way, you'll have my vote to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| But I think that we need to have this discussion of the people that are going to be trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| the training they're going to go through, how we're going to be following up on that training a year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| or so from there, because out of 88 people, one may not need to carry a gun in three years or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| and then how they're going to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| And I know that there's already a procedure in place for handling some of these types of disturbances in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| But I guess I'm just looking for assurances, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| And you and I have had a brief discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| And so I would just like to have this public dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| Yes, I think that's an important question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| and consideration that you raise is the training and supervision evaluation of our school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| We have had an extraordinary partnership with both the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| and with the Knox County Sheriff's Office around training and support for our school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| And we have commitments from both of those organizations to assist us moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| particularly recognizing that hiring an additional 58 officers is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| and having them recruited, selected, hired, trained, and equipped for what we hope will be for the beginning of school is a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5391)|
| 1:30:00| extraordinary effort for us to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| So there has been lots of joint training that has occurred with our school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| and Knoxville Police Department and the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| We've been in conversation just recently with the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| and KPD around the training of officers, new officers, this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| and looking at potentially doing as much as a four-week training period for all new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| And starting with training around the requirements of being a security officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| and then also getting into some of the other types of training that we've done jointly with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| defensive tactics, active shooter drills, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| So the Sheriff's Office and KPD have been terrific in partnership with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| We're looking forward to working with them on the training and support for new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| And, in fact, personnel from both of those organizations have also volunteered to help us in the recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| and selection process of hiring these 58 new officers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| So we feel good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| Certainly, evaluation and supervision of our officers is an ongoing process for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| We want to make sure that that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| We want to make sure that we have a robust infrastructure for that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| And, of course, our officers, our school security officers, as any school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| any officer who works in a school are trained around how best to handle different types of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| My expectation would be that, you know, you would almost never see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| and I think it would only be in extraordinary circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| you would almost never see an officer pull a service weapon in response to a fight in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| I mean, that just doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Their training is very specific on how to deal with different situations, how to de-escalate situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| how to mitigate situations and do so in a way that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| is appropriate response to the individual circumstances that they find themselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5513)|
| 1:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Anything else, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| I just had a question maybe for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| When the schools are going to spend money that was outside their original budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| and they spend their own money, in other words, they're drawing on their own fund balance, do we have to authorize that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Not the law department, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| Thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Do you want to add anything to that, Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Sheriff Jones wanted to respond, I think, to a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Go ahead, JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Just briefly, what Commissioner Hammond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| hopefully in these discussions that we've had with the police department, the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| and school security, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| we have targeted some of these individuals who are veterans, former law enforcement officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| former military people who we would choose to do backgrounds and psychologicals for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| some people who had had some prior training to where we would already be jump started initially with the training we would give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| So those are the people that we would give the most of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| We would look for them, those individuals first, to try to hire in these 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| You know, as we start down this line, we talk a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| But it's kind of what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| I think we both, and we both may give it to the school board and commission, of having two monologues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| and we're not having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| I agree, it would have been great just to have folks pick up the phone and call us up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| and see what we think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Brad, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| You know, shame on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| But shame on us for going public the way we went public with some really, really, you know, strong language from some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| You know, so shame on us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| And what happens then, you kind of can't pull it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| You know, these words, again, it's shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| It's shared responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| We all knew this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| It's not like we didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I mean, yeah, this is a pittance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| This is a piddly sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| And I know it's a lot of money for us personally, but, you know, in terms of the scope of their reserve funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5661)|
| 1:34:29| and in terms of the scope of our reserve funds, it really is a small percentage of that total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| So that's the only way I'll call it a pittance or a small sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| So, you know, and it really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I do think it should come from the school board, so let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| But I understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| I mean, we've done this bait and switch thing before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| You're right, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| I've never heard you go back on your word, but some of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| We have said we're going to vote this way and then we vote that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| So in the aggregate, commission has waffled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| You know, when we all have to own all 11 of us, we have waffled as a commission in terms of how we support things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| So, again, I don't agree with that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| I don't agree with them saying prove it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| But I can understand the apprehension in moving forward with this 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| Now, I think I've heard everyone on this commission say that that 1.9 million is worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| It's a lot better than hiring a sheriff deputy because that sheriff deputy has to do a lot more than just schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| I mean, you have to teach him or her how to do a whole heck of a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| So that's why, you know, it makes more sense to tailor that person to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| But, you know, not asking for a commitment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| But I do think we need to say mayor, finance director, whoever else comes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| and try to say don't spend that 1.9, have a nice day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| Commissioners, constituents, whoever comes to us, say don't spend that 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| I think we need to push back and say, no, we have a serious issue in this nation, in this world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| and this is our first step in dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| So, you know, again, I don't like the way this was brought to us as, you know, prove it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| But by that same token, you know, I didn't like some of the things that I, you know, read about this, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| So, you know, let's stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| Let's say pass this or not, tone down the language or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| I think the school board is going to be fine with paying for it, not talk to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| Shame on me, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| But I think they'll be fine with paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| But let's stop the, you know, the vitriol and just the negativity associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5804)|
| 1:36:53| This is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| We're in a position where we can put armed guards in every school and not raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| We're in great shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Let's not make this a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| This is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| This is the right thing that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Let's not turn it into a negative thing to get us cross ways with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| And when I say school board, please don't turn this into a negative thing to get us cross ways with you all cross ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| with us here on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| This one we can agree on, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| So that's all I'll say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| And hopefully this will go on without, you know, too much between now and Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| without too many more bombs being tossed over the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5848)|
| 1:37:37| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| The reason I turned my light on was in something that Commissioner McKenzie just said about everyone on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| being in favor of $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| If you read the Knoxville News Sentinel, they quote me as saying this is a budget time issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| So I've not said one way or the other what I feel about the $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| The thing that I really would like to speak to, though, on this particular resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| since it's before us, it's numbered in the 900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| Should it more appropriately be numbered in the 200s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| And I say that kind of insignificantly, but I believe that's where we've gotten to at trying to be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| or against or raise the rhetoric or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| This is not, as the second paragraph on the second page says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| a supplemental appropriation of us commissioned to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| This is we do hereby authorize the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| We do hereby authorize the Knox County Board of Education to appropriate from its surplus funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5937)|
| 1:39:09| or reallocate previously appropriated funds in the general purpose school fund of this physical year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| And we've got others of those on today's agenda that we didn't even read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| I have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| I should have really looked back to see if we had larger amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| and things that we didn't even read earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| I remember we're roofing somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| Henley Roofing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| $615,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| This is just $401,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| I cannot see what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| If the Board of Education, and I agree with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| believes this is a significant enough problem that the schools need this particular tune-up or tighten-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=5995)|
| 1:40:05| then we should agree with them on this particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| And then going forward, next year is next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| We will have estimates of cash flow for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| And we'll have to make tough decisions about where the county goes in next year's physical budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| I believe that's what every year is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| And as I have said earlier today, I didn't want to tie the hands of commission 30 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6031)|
| 1:40:40| for example, on property title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| And then we turn around and say we don't want to on other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| we don't want to tie the hands of if we sell real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| I believe we've got to say which direction we're headed in as principle being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| and then try to stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| Using the argument on one resolution on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| then using the same argument to be on the other side of the next resolution doesn't sound very principled to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6066)|
| 1:41:14| Just as I've looked at re-roofing a school costing a couple hundred thousand dollars more than this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| and we didn't even read the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Well, maybe we read it, but we didn't even talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| And I've got a comment sort of in line with yours too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| Go ahead, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Just in response to Commissioner Wright's conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| I mean the request from the Board of Education was for a supplemental appropriation of $219,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| The language that I'm hearing read today is a little bit different from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| And the reason for it really is fairly simple and it's twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| One is what we've heard from many commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| and from the mayor over the last few weeks is let us know what you need in terms of school security and student safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| And so this is, in a way, letting you know what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| And so that was part of why the request was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| But I think the more important question is the one that I think Commissioner Andrews and others have noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| and that's really we're talking about going ahead and hiring 58 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| We'd like to be able to do that prior to July 1st because we want them to be selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| and trained and hired and ready to go for the start of school, which is mid-August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| And what we're looking for, I guess, is just some sort of formal action or vote or sign of support from the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6156)|
| 1:42:45| so that we feel confident in moving forward with that hiring of those 58 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| and without having to worry that perhaps, you know, if we hire them in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| and May we won't have to lay them off in June if the budget isn't approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| That's really what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| It's about making sure that we have the confidence to move forward in hiring 58 additional folks to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| in these incredibly important positions of school security officers for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Mr. Wright, would you like to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| I would just like to say I hear what you're saying from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| What I've got to balance that with is Sheriff Jones is asking for 80 cars, and I can't commit to that today either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6200)|
| 1:43:28| So, looking at the budget time, there are just so many dollars that will be flowing through Knox County's coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6208)|
| 1:43:38| And how that's divided up, I don't know how that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| The sheriff may get all of his cars, and we may say three months from now we've got to do this on school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| But the money has to come from somewhere, and we have to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| Maybe I don't give the sheriff cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| But, you know, all I'm trying to get across is the point that I can't make a commitment today to either one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6236)|
| 1:44:04| because it's not the votes not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| We don't have the facts and figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6255)|
| 1:44:23| I think the superintendent is right in that many of us have said to him and to the school board, let us know what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6263)|
| 1:44:30| And now that they have, we've said, well, you know, that's not really what we had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| This is, in the grand scheme of our total budget, a pretty piddly amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| Frankly, so is $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| We could pay that today if we wanted to, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| So could they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| So could they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| But I tell you what, what I'm really tired of is this, their money, our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| This is the Knox County taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| I don't care what pot it comes out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| And I think maybe a really good way to show some give and take on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| and some support on both sides is if we just split this right down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| Let the school board pay for half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Let Knox County pay for half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| But I'm really tired of the inflammatory rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| And I'm really tired of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| This is our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| This is their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| It's the Knox County taxpayers' money, regardless of which pot it comes out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6328)|
| 1:45:35| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| Thank you, Commissioner Brown, for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| I agree with the gist of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| And I'll be brief, not to be repetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| I was about to say, elaborate on what Commissioner Boyles just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| The public favors this, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| Wherever I've gone, I've heard very little disagreement with additional security in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6355)|
| 1:46:02| And if it takes $220,000 to get it started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| I think the average citizen and taxpayer and voter says let's do it and do it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| And, again, I was the our money versus their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I agree with Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| I think it's a relatively small amount of people that are debating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| It's us and the school board and maybe the administration of the schools and the county, if it's whose money it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| It is the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| And we just have the authority to take it out of their pocket to spend it however we deem appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6391)|
| 1:46:40| And if the school system were bumping into their state law requirement, being a deficit, of course they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6400)|
| 1:46:50| It's addressed in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| They far exceed the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| So I think it's only appropriate from an accounting standpoint that it come from their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| But I don't want to lose the point that it is not our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| It's only our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| If you put $11,000 over $430,000, that's how much of it is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| On the pension board, sometimes we digress in debating if is it the pension board's money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| or is it the sheriff's department's money or is it the county's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| Really, it's all comes from the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Again, it comes out of the taxpayer when he wrote that check last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| Nevertheless, I'm debating that too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| Having said that, I do agree totally that, going forward, we need to have this in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6448)|
| 1:47:35| The $220,000 now and the $1.3 million, whatever it is going forward, I don't know what that number is, $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6455)|
| 1:47:44| I support it being there and not hiring and training these officers and suddenly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| well, we can't fund you come August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| I'm meeting with Dr. McIntyre this week, as I assume most of you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| so I don't know what the numbers are other than what I read in the paper yesterday, a $13 million request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6475)|
| 1:48:02| which is really about a 3% increase, I think, which I hope is manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| But I will officially say I hope this additional security these officers are in place going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6488)|
| 1:48:16| I don't want to get caught in that maintenance of effort thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| It seems that ten different people have ten different definitions of what maintenance of effort is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| But, nevertheless, I think the public doesn't necessarily care what maintenance of effort is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| and we need the security in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| And I have one sort of a black-and-white question after I've done my editorializing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| I guess, Dr. McIntyre, what you know, I'm familiar with the schools where my kid goes to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| So I'm going to use that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Bearden Middle is fed by city and it's fed by county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| It has a KPD and it has an SRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| And I'm looking at the 58 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| I assume the deficits for security are primary to elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Most of our elementary schools do not have a school resource officer or a school security officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| So using Bearden Middle as an example, the KPD officer, is he funded by the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| So if you have 50-odd schools in the elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| and the majority of them are without security, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Yes, elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Elementary, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| We have officers at all of our high schools, all of our middle schools, and at several of our elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| but not all of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| So my question is, and I'm not holding them to the bringing them into the debate necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| but because that's city taxpayers pay county taxes also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| But do you know if the city, maybe we can go look at this going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| will bring KPD officers into the elementary schools within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| Both the KPD and the sheriff's office currently deploy officers to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| And we are very grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| They don't have an obligation to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| but they've engaged in this great partnership with us to help us keep our schools safe and our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6606)|
| 1:50:12| And they plan to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| And so they will continue to have 17 officers deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| My understanding is that the sheriff will continue to have 24 officers deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| But we want to make sure that we have an officer at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| And so the most cost-effective way to do that is for us to do it through school security officers in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6624)|
| 1:50:32| you know, their contract is a 10-month contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| So generally speaking, they don't work in the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| And so it's, you know, their average salary is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| And unlike a KPD officer or a sheriff's officer, they don't necessarily have to have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| They don't necessarily have to have a laptop computer, all those things that come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| So from a cost-efficiency perspective, adding 58 additional officers that are school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6651)|
| 1:50:59| is the most cost-effective way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| So in all probability, the city would not be supplying KPD to those schools that are within the city limits that we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| They're not planning to add additional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Just as the, you know, as we've talked with KPD, as we've talked with the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| we've really agreed that this is the best way to approach it is to make sure that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| if we have 58 additional security officers, we can have a robust deployment that has an officer at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| And then for KPD and the sheriff's office to work with us around training and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| and continue the partnership and collaboration that we currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| You know, I think that's a great approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| And I agree with the sheriff and the chief that that's the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| And so, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Then the KPD officers in the schools currently then are done at the option of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| just like they give us 72 percent instead of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| It's their generosity, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Ms. Carson, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| I just want to speak very quickly to some of the comments that I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| at the beginning of this discussion, and share with you what the intent of the board was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| The board did believe that they needed to, that there are a number of additional safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| and security features that we are going to have to deploy at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| The first one is having an SRO at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| Knowing that, we knew that to get started, if we wait until budget's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| and we start July 1 with the fiscal year, that's when you start advertising positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| And you have to go through posting and hiring and then training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| We'll never be ready by the start of school with 58 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| Those are the positions that are in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| And those are the positions that are not going to be one-time expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| Obviously, they're ongoing, they're personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| If we can start earlier, we can get these people hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| we can get the equipment ordered that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| and we can get the training done to be ready to go by August 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| The board never did specify in their discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| it has to come from the county's funds or the board's funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| And we didn't because we knew that, irregardless, it had to come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| That total amount of $219,000 would have to come before you at any rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6804)|
| 1:53:32| What is really important is knowing that we don't get equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| and hire people and not have the approval for the 1.9 starting in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6817)|
| 1:53:46| Now, if there is a one of the questions we asked a number of people is it's a very unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6826)|
| 1:53:55| There's not a way that we can, you know, we're well aware it's next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| but we also are well aware that we need to get moving on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| There's no mechanism in place that we're aware of to appropriately go through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| without saying put it before the body for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| It wasn't a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| It wasn't a get you kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| It was the only mechanism that we knew to put it before you and get a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| And, frankly, if I were to hear from the majority of you what I'm hearing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| from Commissioner Wright saying I can't tell you anything about which way I'm going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| until we deal with next year's budget, then I can, in good conscience as a board member, start hiring anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6876)|
| 1:54:45| So if anybody has a mechanism that should be followed, we're more than happy to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| I'm not aware of one in which to go, but I think there's, you know, I think Commissioner McKenzie was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6892)|
| 1:55:01| It's a two-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| This communication is two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| So, obviously, we have open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| We have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| I'm not expecting you to view all of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| But when this item comes up on your agenda and it says something, I wish your school board member had called you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| but I would say call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Commissioner McKenzie asked me, are you saying that has to come from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| My response right away was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| What I'm saying is the $1.9 million is very important to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| And so we can do this both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| I can tell you every time I see something on your agenda, if I have a question, I call somebody and ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6931)|
| 1:55:38| When I saw the proposal to change the surplus and eliminate the McKenzie-Pingston thing, that directly affects schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6938)|
| 1:55:48| I didn't have any commissioner call me and check that out with me first or ask me how that affected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| You know, when I saw your resolution to support elected superintendents, that directly affects me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| I didn't have any commissioners call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| So I think it just this is why we're trying to get the two groups together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| This is why we're trying to establish appropriate mechanisms to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| But I can tell you there was absolutely no intent, because I led this on the board, to put this in your face and say, you know, got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6970)|
| 1:56:20| We absolutely believe it's a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| The sheriff believes it's a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| The police chief believes it's a need and it's the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| And I don't know a better mechanism to go about requesting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Somewhere I saw that letter that came over, and I believe that it was a request for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=6999)|
| 1:56:48| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| How many ASROs do you all have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| We have 39 full-time day shift school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| Armed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Where did they come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| They're in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| They're funded through the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Is that what you're asking, where the dollars came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| But it was a budget item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| We said we don't have the 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| You throw this up the flagpole to say we just want to see if you're all going to support us on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7037)|
| 1:57:25| So what if we don't support it on the other, on the 1.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| You've still got $24.6 million sitting in your rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| And, folks, it's raining out here on this side of Gay Street just like it is on the other side of Gay Street today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| Now, that 1.9, if you add the $220,000 to it, it's still only 0.08% of what's in your rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7060)|
| 1:57:50| So don't come to us and say you don't have any money to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| What I want to know is what's being done with the money that you do have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| Somebody mentioned about waffling back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Dr. Briggs knows what bob and weave means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| Some of the rest of you all may know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| But we have to do that a lot because you're coming at you from all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| Who did the survey to determine exactly what is needed for this particular security project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| What is the pattern after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Did it work there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| How much thought and preparation has gone into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| Are we just jumping on this because something happened in Connecticut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| and all of a sudden we've got to get all hearty and spend some money to try to do something about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7114)|
| 1:58:43| Amy mentioned the departmental budgets, whether it's their money or our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| But this county is a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| Each department has a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| If we overspend our budget on this side over here, we can't go over to the other side and get money from their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7134)|
| 1:59:02| Everybody works on a budget, just like I said a while ago, in your households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| It's taxpayers' money, both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| But I'm telling you something right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| The taxpayers in Knox County need to look about what they're getting for the bucks that we send across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| It's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| When we got kids coming out of our high schools, 74 percent of them have to have remedial courses to get into Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7160)|
| 1:59:29| There's something wrong with this $450-some million that we spent on education last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7169)|
| 1:59:37| Something's got to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| A shortcut to getting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Well, it's on as a discussion item today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| Couldn't have been voted on today anyway, but with this resolution that we're passing, we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| we'll authorize you to go ahead and use that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| As has been mentioned previously, any money that comes out of there has to be run by the commission to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| It's not that we're trying to fight you all on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| We want you to be physically conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| As we've been reminded many times, we sat down at our, as I call it, our sleepover last January when we met together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7210)|
| 2:00:19| First words out of Len Fugate's mouth were, you all can't tell us how to spend the money you give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7219)|
| 2:00:27| That may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| But is that a way to start a kumbaya meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| So, folks, I'm a little bit perturbed about things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| And I guess you can probably tell it by now, but I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| Well, we do have one more light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| Is that okay if we thank Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Then I'd like to wrap it up and we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Go ahead, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| I promise that I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| And what I'm asking here is I think we can accomplish what we need to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7256)|
| 2:01:03| But first let me comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| I don't want to put JJ on the spot, but we've had a lot of meetings about where this uniformed officer in every school came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| We've had a lot of meetings about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| We've had a lot of in-depth discussion about, from Chief Rouse and the sheriff, about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| We've done that homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| And, you know, they have strong, strong, I don't think I've heard as strong a recommendation ever in my five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7285)|
| 2:01:32| as those two men have come to us and said that this is a good thing, this is a needed first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| So I guess I'll push back a little bit on why the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| But I like to try to do it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| And that is to put a rider on this to say something to the effect that we're asking the school board to pay for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7305)|
| 2:01:56| out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| However, we know these are ongoing costs to the tune of $1.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| and we understand that that would be an ongoing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| Now, it's not pushing a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| It's not saying I'm going to vote for that or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| But it's saying this is a shared expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| If you use Brad's number, which I think are pretty accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| we're looking at $5.5 million in the school board budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| If they just ate it, they'd be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| That means they won't get fired in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| They'll be fired in two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| So, you know, there's no way we're going to have to appropriate this $1.9 million if we want these officers in the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7346)|
| 2:02:37| So what I'm looking for, and I'll ask the maker of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| if he would agree to that friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| to say is that basically we understand that this is an ongoing expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| and that these monies will have to come from new revenue sources to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| Will come from what, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| From that these ongoing expenses will have to come as new money to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| These will have to be new monies that's going to come up in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7381)|
| 2:03:10| As the maker of the motion, I'd prefer not to, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Well, I'd like to make a substitute motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7399)|
| 2:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Nobody has a right to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| Well, the only thing I have an issue, I mean, I don't have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| The wording of that, you know, says that there's an automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| We don't know what Dr. McIntyre's proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| And so that's a, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7422)|
| 2:03:49| Just the wording of the new monies or I think there's going to be an increase in their funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| but the priorities are their choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| And so, I mean, I support Commissioner Brown's and I support having an armed guard in every school next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7436)|
| 2:04:06| and knowing it's going to be $3 million every year for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| But I think this amendment will pass with the understanding that I think everybody has that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| The wording of that kind of scares me a little bit, I guess, is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| As worded, if I stand by what I said earlier, I can't commit to something that's in next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| and the budget not before us, then I can't support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| But I would like to say I like some of the words that Commissioner McKenzie just used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7479)|
| 2:04:45| and that new money, maybe we don't know what the state's going to do about security ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7485)|
| 2:04:53| There may be new money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| But to ask me to commit to something for a budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| and the budget not to be before us, then I can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7500)|
| 2:05:10| Mr. Caldwell, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| I'm sorry if there's been a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| No one's asking with this motion that anyone commit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| What they're asking is that there is an acknowledgment that this will be an ongoing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| There is no commitment anywhere in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| It's just a formal acknowledgment in the public record that we understand this is going to be an ongoing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| I think the term, and I think that's what Brad was saying, the term new money kind of is kind of a scary thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7544)|
| 2:05:51| I mean, you think new money, you think bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| I think saying growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| I mean, through natural growth we can cover these ongoing expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| I think if you say that, I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| I have sat down with Dr. McIntyre and their finance department, and they've included this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| I'm letting the cat out of the bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| But they've included this money in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| And with the mayor's office and myself and with them included, we're working toward a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7573)|
| 2:06:20| And are we there yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| But it's early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| I mean, it's March the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| We've got a month and a half for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| And we're going to continue to work on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| But I think the term new money is kind of sketchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| I think if you say through natural growth, that may make everybody more at ease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| I'll be fine to say that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| I'll keep this very brief, is the reason that the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| and if I'm saying something incorrect, I'll allow Dr. McIntyre to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| But the reason that we're making or that the school board made this request now is they wanted to start the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| recruiting and training officers so they would be prepared to go into the schools when school starts in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7628)|
| 2:07:16| That's why the request has come through early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| Some of you have not had the benefit of the briefing that Dr. McIntyre has on the school budget for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| But the budget that you will be giving, I think it's $419.45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| And that includes about a 406 last year, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| I believe that the budget that you're going to submit, that you're working on with the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7657)|
| 2:07:44| will include monies for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| So, really, when we approve a budget, we don't approve the budget in bits and pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| saying we'll give you money for reading, we'll give you money for teachers' increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| but we won't give you money for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| We don't do that in bits and pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| We really approve or disapprove of a lump sum budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| We don't do that in part to say we'll give you money, you know, extra dollars to raise teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| And the budget that the superintendent submits to us is what he says he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| Now, we can give him that much money or we can give him less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| And then, still, he and the school board have to go back and decide how to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| So, you know, I disagree just a little bit with what Commissioner McKenzie is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7705)|
| 2:08:32| that we're going to approve certain funds for the $1.9 million because we really can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| But I think if we do want to have officers in the schools, we need to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| And I do like what Commissioner Brown has here, saying that we will authorize the school to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7724)|
| 2:08:53| I think it's $219,000, I can't remember if it's $219,000 or $217,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| to go ahead and start recruiting and training the officers so they're available this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| And then we'll approve a budget when that time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| And not for this or not for that, but we'll approve a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| And then the school's going to have to figure out how they're going to live with it or not live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| Just as a point of order, we did exactly that with Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| That's an unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| And I think we all recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| That was not the final statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| You were the one that called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| He called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Now you want to talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| He's rewound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Yeah, I'm rewound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7777)|
| 2:09:37| One final statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| If they wanted to hire these 58, all they had to do was send us a request across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| to spend this $219,000 from their rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| It would have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| They could have hired them next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| Now, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| We could have been home an hour and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| I would like to say a couple of things since I've kind of been involved in this security issue for a month now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| I think we all agree that there's no debate about the necessity for armed guards in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7807)|
| 2:10:17| It's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| And so that's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Certainly, to me, I'm a little bit disturbed about how all this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| I don't think it's going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| I'm going to speak against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| That's what's before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Just on simplicity's sake, if nothing else, I don't disagree completely with Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| I think there is a ramp there or something that could be troublesome in the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| whether or not we call it new money or, I mean, new money sounds like we've got to go get some new money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| when you say new money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| But natural growth is maybe what can accommodate the security needs, and hopefully that will be so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| But the issue is still, we're still having a conversation about having a conversation with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7865)|
| 2:11:14| And there is still a lot of angst and distrust on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| and I'm sure on their body between the bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| And so, indeed, we do need to have some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| and have possibly, you know, some type of workshop when the mediator gets well as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7892)|
| 2:11:43| I suppose I am, you know, because of my perspective about the security issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| and how it blew up and how it's just kept going and it had a life of its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| I am disturbed that this request, that it didn't just come over in a 200, like Mr. Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7916)|
| 2:12:04| It should have been a 200 and it should have been a, you know, we're taking care of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| and I don't know what kind of game, budgetary, it seems like a budgetary game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| I don't want to be demeaning or derogatory in my tone, but it seems like something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7936)|
| 2:12:23| Why do it this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| So that's a hard question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| And I'm, because of that and because of those reasons, I'm speaking against the substitute motions for us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7947)|
| 2:12:36| So we've had a call for the questions, so let's go with the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| and let's have a roll call on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| Can you state the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| Mr. McKenzie, your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| Would you restate your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| It's everything the Commissioner Brown's resolution states and an additional statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| that we understand that there will be an additional financial fee of $1.9 million that will need to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7979)|
| 2:13:09| And if funded, it would have to be by natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| Does that sound okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| It sounds fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Roll call and let's start with you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| Substitute motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| The $219 million is coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| A thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| A thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| Don't give them the attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| I meant $219,000 is coming from their funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| This allows them after our vote Monday, if it passes, it allows them after their vote Monday to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| You're voting yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Commissioner Schell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8044)|

| 2:14:06| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Six-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Six-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Substitute motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Six-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8065)|
| 2:14:43| We're on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Item number 28 is discussion regarding ProNova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| This is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| I had asked for a brief discussion or a report from Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| Chris, can you do this or do we need to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| The reason I have put this on for a discussion is because of the most of you were not on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| when this was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| And this was a joint relationship with Blount County and, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| Anderson County where we were developing this land at Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| but with the stipulation that as we had tenants and people who moved into that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8114)|
| 2:15:20| that Knox County would be part of the beneficiary of any of the tax revenue and any of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8120)|
| 2:15:27| And so I just wanted to just kind of revisit that just for the purposes of saying this was the deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| and this is what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| So I'm talking with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| Chris, if you're not ready to do this, I mean, but if you are, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| We reached out a little bit and we've not got any answers back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| But just so you know, this joint business park was supposed to be any, I guess, plant that goes in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8144)|
| 2:15:58| not plants, but any investment, any type of infrastructure that goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8158)|
| 2:16:05| We should get a quarter of the land sale and then a quarter of ongoing property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| Now, we're trying to figure out and we're working with them to figure out how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| I would imagine that Blount County would collect all the taxes up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| and then cut us the other three parties a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| And now deal with the pro nova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| I'm pretty sure they sold them that land for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| I guess we'll get a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| But we'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| I won't ever turn down money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| But then we'll have ongoing property taxes once they start paying property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| You're going to get taxes for the next TIF time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| And I'm sure there could be a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| I'm not kept really up to date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| But the hope there is by getting one form of business in that business park that more will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8209)|
| 2:17:00| And as more comes, they won't be getting the land for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| They'll start paying more market value for this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| And then we will not only get a quarter of the sale of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| we'll get a quarter of the property taxes moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| So I think your point was it wasn't a total loss for pro nova to have chosen this Blount County business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8235)|
| 2:17:23| instead of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| Sure, we'd like to have it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| But this investment was made five years ago or so for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| So we will reap some rewards from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| Well, also, just in terms of the employment and the opportunity for people to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| and also as they're doing the construction phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| I'm sure some of that business is going to come out of Knox County and materials will be purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| So, anyway, I just wanted just kind of a brief thing to kind of reiterate, you know, what was going on down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| Anything else there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| Nothing, Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| Oh, we had a discussion item that was mined there on the $218,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| So we'll just withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| So the next item is number 30, spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| The Knox County Mayor's appointment of Bobby Christenberry to the Knox County Personnel Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| Ms. Christenberry is serving the unexpired term of tyranny baits, which term expires December 20, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8299)|
| 2:18:27| That doesn't require a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| No action, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| Just spread of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| Just spread of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| Member number five, we're going to appoint somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| So is there two vacancies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| This one filled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| This is the mayor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| We have an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| What's that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Commissioner McKenzie's discussion item at it regarding the sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| You know, this is a question for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| And kind of reading the paper and looking at things, it seemed that I'll try to tap dance around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8345)|
| 2:19:15| But I guess my question is, I probably won't tap dance around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| It looks like the mayor met with several people, came to a conclusion, and then presented something in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| you know, he had personal meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| Hey, how do you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| How do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| How do you feel about the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| Again, that's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| He didn't meet with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| And then we get this, you know, again, it was associated with item 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8373)|
| 2:19:39| So I think it was 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| It was either that one or the properties one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| And I just wonder, is that strictly from the sunshine law, is that a surrogate acting at the behest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8385)|
| 2:19:54| I mean, acting to poll the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| Is that something that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| Can any citizen or can the newspaper or the city council, someone poll us because there's an item that they want to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8399)|
| 2:20:08| and they meet with all of us individually and then come to a, you know, count to six or seven or eight or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| and then move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| So I just want some general understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| And it may just be a question for you to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| I don't want you to, I mean, if you have an answer, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| But I don't want to put you necessarily on the spot on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| In terms of the sunshine law is to prohibit deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| And then the surrogate issue is finding out how we're influencing people's vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| and then turn around and telling others that you need to vote this way because I've got so many others by name who are voting this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8440)|
| 2:20:49| But any of the department heads or any administration can call in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| and talk to you, see where you are, see what they may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| It helps them, you know, as individuals to get a feel of what the direction that these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8458)|
| 2:21:05| that the board of directors is taking this corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| He can even lobby you as any other citizen can to call every one of you and say, please vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| or just like any other e-mails coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| And that's not a sunshine thing because he is not a deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| And as long as he is not, or he, I'm saying the mayor in your example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| but as long as that third party is not using that information to affect the deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8488)|
| 2:21:38| then there's not a sunshine issue is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| I'll get you something in specifics on that, though, in writing to help you see where that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8501)|
| 2:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| You know, I guess just for us, I mean, it's kind of disturbing to have, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| we've got six votes in the paper, and we haven't met on it officially yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| So maybe it's not a violation, but to me, that's just, it's a tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| tough way for us as a body to try to be cohesive when we're saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| well, there's no need to have a meeting on Monday because it looks like the paper is saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| this is going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| That's just, that's bothersome in terms of the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| So thank you for getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| One more thing, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| A lot of times when we have the press here or they were here a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| a lot of times they will be the ones actually calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| And then they come around and they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Even when I was on commission, I had a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| So there's some issues on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| But to influence you or to tell others how you're going to vote is not necessarily proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8553)|
| 2:22:40| But to actually poll or discuss or talk to you about things as any citizen can is not a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| But I'll look into this third-party revealing for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| I would like to address the concerns of the mayor of Knox County talking to members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8575)|
| 2:23:04| It's quite possible that I was the first member of commission that Mayor Burchett talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| And the reason I say that is because I believe the phone calls were probably all generated at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8590)|
| 2:23:19| trying to schedule a date and a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| And it was like 10 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| And I said, when's the next available time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Because I was on my way to Home Depot, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8607)|
| 2:23:35| And if that was a 10 o'clock call, the available time was 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| And, actually, that didn't turn out to be the available time because the mayor had not assembled his witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8622)|
| 2:23:50| at that particular time to witness what he was going to say to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| What I'm trying to say is I believe it perfectly appropriate that the chief executive of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8635)|
| 2:24:06| talk individually one-on-one with his, and if we're looking in the business world, his board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8646)|
| 2:24:15| and maybe state a case as to what he thinks should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| I also want to then turn around and say exactly the words I said a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8660)|
| 2:24:26| I cannot commit to something that's not before me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| Now, if the mayor asked me my opinion of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8671)|
| 2:24:39| or how I would vote on something, that would have to be the words I gave him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| because that's the words I give you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| I cannot commit myself to something that's not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| I would like to go a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| I had no notes in my hand when I went into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| I had no notes in my hand when I left the meeting, and I was accompanied by my staff that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| So I'll commit to you that the mayor may have presented his case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8707)|
| 2:25:15| and the new sentinel may have polled me for my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| and I was quoted in the newspaper as saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| I can't commit to anything until it's properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| I don't think that has anything to do with sunshine because I have been asked by superintendents of schools for a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8728)|
| 2:25:38| I was given three dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| One was the day I have to accompany my dad to the doctor's visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| One, I had a prior commitment, and the other one seems to fit in, and I believe it's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8745)|
| 2:25:52| I can't commit to the date and time, but I think it is Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| If I can't listen to the mayor of Knox County give me a position on the financial status of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8757)|
| 2:26:07| I would think then, as I've been arguing earlier today, the principle of the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8767)|
| 2:26:13| I don't think that Dr. McIntyre then should be presenting to me as a commissioner either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8773)|
| 2:26:20| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| I will hear, I think it's Thursday afternoon at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| Now, I know other commissioners can't be there, but it's up to the superintendent who will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| and I believe he has two people scheduled to meet with me at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| And it just so happens, I think, that it's working that I will have been somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| and my wife will be riding with me that day, and my staff will be in attendance of that meeting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8801)|
| 2:26:49| So to ask a question that would sort of slant toward me as a member of Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8809)|
| 2:26:59| not knowing what sunshine rules govern us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| probably then rises to the level of making me make the response that I've just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8823)|
| 2:27:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| We have one more discussion item, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| We've got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8840)|
| 2:27:21| Maybe the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| But we're going to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Go ahead on Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| The next discussion item is regarding Visit Knoxville tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| And I had talked with Kim Bumpus about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| They really want us to come, and we didn't respond very well the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| That may be my fault because I didn't really send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| I think you might have got it in a blast e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| But anyway, I'll try to do a better job at coordinating a time next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| What I had, I had a meeting with Kim this morning, and I've been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| And I spoke with her, and I suggested doing it, her hosting a lunch up there at a chairman's lunchtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8873)|
| 2:28:00| and doing it because what it is, is each segment of their office, marketing, sales, and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| come in and do a PowerPoint, and it's really informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| It lets you know what the whole company does, and it will answer a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| And I told her, if you fed the commission, they'll probably show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| So that was my suggestion to her, and she's going to get with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| That's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| And whenever there's food at the luncheon, we know we'll have at least a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| So the date that's before us is canceled, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| That one, yeah, that's canceled now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| Next item is discussion regarding the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| I'll give a brief discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| I should add that we need to put this on discussion also at the regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| because the main, one of the main situations we discussed was our auditor, Richard Walls' audit of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8928)|
| 2:28:58| electronic commerce card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| And if you've, I don't know if the commission's been part of these back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| and forth e-mails between Richard and Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| And I don't see Hugh here, so I would like to make sure he's here when we discuss those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| So Richard and he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| We've got a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| The other two items can be fairly, I'll be, I'll go over one, which was good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| There was good, there was positive data coming out of the trustees' clearing account, which they're now looking at monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8963)|
| 2:29:33| They've made immense progress in balancing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| This is a report from Pew and Company, our external auditor, who I think is doing an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8977)|
| 2:29:44| His goal is not to say, I got you, but to basically say that the process has improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8984)|
| 2:29:52| and there's, the accounts are being balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=8992)|

| 2:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9025)|

| 2:30:33| and we can report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9033)|

| 2:30:45| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9047)|

| 2:30:49| Is that it, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| I have one question and I'm going to say it publicly just so the law director can check into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9050)|
| 2:30:56| I've gotten a couple of e-mails from people that are trying to get permits for the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| You know, those are the, you know, the ones that, they're the on-premise signs that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| and none of the, none of them are being permitted because there's, quote, pending legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| And I'd like just to find out where we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| I mean, if there's something out there that I'm, that's what I was talking to Commissioner Anders about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| and I think that his has basically become inactive now, the swap and trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| So if there isn't anything out there, they can go ahead and start permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| And if there is something out there, just what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| Maybe that's what, you know, I don't know if you know anything about it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9091)|

| 2:31:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9096)|

| 2:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130318?start=9102)|
