| 0:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| So are you going to remind us a little bit about your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| This is actually a second location in Knoxville, so I'm actually the member and owner of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=123)|
| 0:02:17| downtown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| So back, it was about two years ago, we did get approved for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| So we have since expanded into the franchise market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| So this is Russell Abercrombie, taking on the franchise of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| So far, we're a little ways away from build out, but the sport of axe throwing has definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| grown over the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| And so we're excited as this kind of expands into experience, family, fun, entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| So we've had a joy kind of in the Knoxville area, and look forward to kind of expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| And I can definitely go into safety measures if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=172)|

| 0:04:56| And when me and my partner, my wife and I, we go out and we go out and we go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| we go out and we go out and we go out and we go out and we go out and we go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| go out and we go out and we go out and drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| We saw a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| When we walked in, we saw a great opportunity you know, here in Knoxville, that we may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| able to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| And what we noticed that, and as not only happening here in Knoxville, but across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| state or that, there's a huge lack of diversity in the commercial knowledge and at the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| of clients that there are revenues and controls that are being put on beer that are made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| their profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| a huge lack of diversity in craft beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| So we saw this as an opportunity that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| can enhance what's already happening here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| by introducing and creating an environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| encouraging diversity, inclusivity, and communal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| growth through approachable beers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| and a welcoming environment to all walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| We see areas that we can target, that we can be intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| that can hopefully bring an influx of a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| of different demographics into the craft beer culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| here, and we see that if Ebony Ivory is successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| we think all the breweries around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| will actually be successful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| We just need the building fire and health approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=375)|
| 0:06:24| OK, so at this point, because you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| got two permits before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| so this is for the on-off premise permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| that we're approving right now in this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| So do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Do you all have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Yeah, I have a little follow-up comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Chico, I've been watching this development for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| It's in my district along that area of Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Describe it as a smile with some missing teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| and you will put a nice tooth in there to make it a shiny smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| John Sanders has worked really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| in that area of the developer and the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I've done on-site visits, and we were really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| happy to get such good tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| And so that's really not only hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| will be a beneficial business for your sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| but it's in an area in town that has needed some uplifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| and to take that blighted property and redo it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| and then find good tenants like yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| is going to be an asset to that part of Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| So I wish you all the luck in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| It means a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Yeah, well, I think Councilman Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| knows the answer to this, but are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| going in the development there where Hard Knocks Pizza is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=469)|
| 0:07:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| In the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Are you going to have outdoor space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Yes, we do have outdoor patio space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| OK, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| All right, well, I'm going to walk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| and Councilman Thomas can walk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| and we can meet in the middle and come visit you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| What's your anticipated for opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| We say to end of summer, end of summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| OK, because you're doing interior build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| The outside's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Yeah, we're doing interior build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| We should be finalizing with our GC the build-out and the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| And then from that point, he'll be able to pull a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| and get to doing whatever he has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| The build-out shouldn't take long at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| because it's going to be pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=501)|
| 0:08:21| We'll look forward to visiting with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Thanks for the info on when you're opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And then up next is also Ebony and Ivory, Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Just need the building, fire, and health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| And this is for the manufacturing distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| piece, or this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| So all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Chico, if you know, I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| three spaces in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Do you know if they found a client for that third space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| I believe so, but I'm not sure if they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| signed a lease on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I wouldn't feel comfortable saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| what I think it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| But I believe he has found somebody for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| But that's changed a few times since we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| going through this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| So I'm not quite sure exactly who it is that's moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| but I do think he has somebody in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| And did I say 2,300 North Central?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| 4E is Fanbase West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=592)|
| 0:10:06| Welcome to Beer Board, if you'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Marty Bellis, 7113 Hickory Hills Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| You want to tell us a little bit about this venture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| So I own Fanatic Brewing Company and 2735 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| And we have a pub attached to the production brewery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| called Fanbase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| And so I was approached by the Simon Mall people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| to take over operations of a little craft beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| pub in the center of the food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| So a better part of just over three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Simon was retooling some of their food courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220517?start=642)|
