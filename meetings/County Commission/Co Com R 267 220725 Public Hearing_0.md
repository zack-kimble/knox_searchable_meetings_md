| 0:01:16| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=76)|
| 0:01:18| We will move now into the public forum, which is the majority of the agenda for this public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=78)|
| 0:01:29| There are 20 individuals that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| Under our rules, I'm going to allow up to three minutes for each speaker because there are a lot of speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| and we do have a commission meeting immediately following this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| We'll be as lenient as possible. I won't cut anybody off in mid-sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| but we would ask you to please keep your remarks to three minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| I would just request of my colleagues, I know there is an item about discussion on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=113)|
| 0:02:01| We can't take any action on this ordinance until we actually hear it during the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| so I would request that we hold our discussion among the body until we actually hear the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| so we can move on to the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| With that said, our first speaker is Ms. Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| Good evening, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| If you'll just state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you. My name is Lisa Starbuck, 6229 Babeley Road, and my district commissioner is Richie Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=149)|
| 0:02:38| I want to start out by thanking commissioners for serving in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| I've been doing this a long time, longer than most all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| and I know it's a hard job with many difficult decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| For well over 30 years, I have been involved in Knox County's civic affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| I have worked with county executives, county mayors, county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| MPC commissioners and directors, and planning commissioners and directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| I've seen a lot of faces come and go, and some of them reappear now and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| I've been advocating for and against various issues and served on a wide variety of committees since the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| I've been involved in a few political campaigns over the years, working as a volunteer only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| never been paid, for issues or candidates that I felt strongly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| I have served on several county commission subcommittees on topics ranging from stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| to hillside development to charter review, advocated for new schools at Carter, Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| Hardin Valley, and Adrian Burnett, and improvements at many other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| I fought for New Harvest Park, which is now one of the most visited parks in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| and has proven to be a great asset to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| I have also advocated against a few issues in my day, most notably Midway Road Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| which 20 years later is still empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| In the days before email, communicating with commissioners on an issue was a bit more difficult than today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| You had to reach a commissioner by telephone or show up at events they were at or send a letter or sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| When there was a big issue going on, we would burn up the phone lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| I've had many commissioners say they couldn't use their phone for a week when there was a hot issue going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| because every time they hung up, the phone would ring again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| I've heard that a couple of commissioners don't like to get what they're calling form emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| which is the modern-day equivalent of signing a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I suppose those commissioners would not like it if we gave out their cell number and asked constituents to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| I am not going to belabor the points that have been made already about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| because I know you have received many logical and reasonable comments already, and there are many more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| It boils down to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Citizens need a voice because every decision made by a government body is not always the right one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| and forcing them to go straight to court is not the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| There are often extenuating circumstances that citizens may not have a chance to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| in the five minutes they are allotted at planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| A wise politician was counseling a newly elected commissioner once in my hearing, and I've never forgotten his words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| He said to the new commissioner, just remember to stay with the people and you won't go wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| So I'm asking you today to stay with the people, codify the rights of citizens as well as the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| to appeal first to BZA before the difficult, expensive, and lengthy process of going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Thank you, Ms. Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Our next speaker is Walter Fane, and after that will be Nadine Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| Good evening, Mr. Fane. If you'll state your name and county of residence. You have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| My name is Walter Fane. I'm a long-term resident of Martha Washington Heights in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| I speak on behalf of the Martha Washington Heights Neighborhood Association, 170 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| I speak against this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| We feel that the zoning appeals process should be heard by a representative group of people with knowledge in these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:25| people who have experience with the layers and intricacies of these appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| people who can bring experience on how other cases have been decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| people who can find common ground and compromise solutions when appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| Knowledge, consistency, experience, vision, and fairness are the qualities we want in an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=403)|
| 0:06:55| This can best be done by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| We oppose the option to bypass this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Ms. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| Good evening. If you'll state your name and county of residence. You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=433)|

| 0:07:23| Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=443)|

| 0:07:30| I represent 45 homes in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| I'm also here speaking on behalf of Gibbs Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| We are an organized group to facilitate and ensure community advocacy on behalf of those living and working in the Gibbs-Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| regarding residential and commercial growth and infrastructure planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Commissioner and Chairman Beeler is my 8th District Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| We are opposed to taking away the right to appeal to development plans and uses on review to the local Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| We are opposed to requiring development plans and uses on reviews to be filed directly to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| The process of sending these to the BZA works, and it has worked for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| It continues to be the most fair, cost-effective, and efficient method for all parties involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| and with the resolution in a timely manner instead of years tied up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| We are asking you to direct both appeals of development plans and uses on review to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| We are asking to continue using the process that has a longstanding history of being effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Again, I'm here representing Fort Reynolds and Gibbs Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| and I'm here because we are against the proposal to take away our right to appeal to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| We would like for you to ensure that these appeals be sent to the BZA first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| without the option for a developer to opt out and send it straight to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you, Ms. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=535)|

| 0:09:04| Ms. Richards here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=544)|
| 0:09:16| Good evening. If you'll state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| I'm Misty Richards, and my address is 7134 Forest Willow Lane in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| I'm representing Edwards Place, a division comprised of 90 homes in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| My commissioner is Chairman Richie Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| and we are opposed to requiring appeals of development plans or uses on review to be filed directly to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| These appeals need to stay directed to the local Boarding of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| As some of you are aware, we residents of Edwards Place went through the appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| before the BZA in January 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| concerning the Woodbury Crossing Development Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| that was proposed for the back portion of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| We requested the requirement of a common area and for Edwards Place residents to have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| And we also requested the addition of passive and active recreational uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Ultimately, BZA modified the ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| by adding in pedestrian connectivity to the proposed Twin Oak Lane development next to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| While we did not get everything we wanted through the appeals process, we were heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| Our neighborhood's HOA never transferred over from the developer to the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| and would take lawyers to straighten out the mess, which our residents cannot afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| We are made up of mostly young families, retirees, and blue-collared workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| Likewise, my neighborhood and I would not be able to afford lawyer fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| and court costs necessary to appeal directly to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| To appeal before the BZA, we worked with our neighbors to collect enough funds for the $200 appeal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| But the cost of appealing directly to court would have kept us from having that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| We would have lost our chance to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| We residents of Edwards Place are disappointed that this proposal seeks to remove our right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| to appeal uses on review or development plans to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| As Gibbs and the Coryton community are developing at an accelerated pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| including former large acre farms near Edwards Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| it is vital now more than ever that you ensure appeals are sent to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| Finally, we want you to know that engaging in these plans usually falls on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| There's a development plan proposal on next month's planning agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| for the Woodbury Crossing Community Center in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| The applicant knows who we are from the appeal in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| We received the proposal from planning staff, but the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| who has contact information for a few of our residents, has not reached out to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| despite filing their development request nearly a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| The burden for engaging is on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you, Ms. Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=734)|

| 0:12:23| Good evening. You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| You have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Yes. My name is Julie McBee Fritz. I live in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| I'm here to ask that this BZA be denied that has been asked for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| This will abolish our right for the citizens to have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| If it is approved, this will give the builders and developers an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| If the courts are to be involved, which I understand that the next step would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| there could be an exorbitant cost to the plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| If unable to build a record, meaning that they can't go before the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and they can't have their voice heard to file that petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| you cannot build the court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Therefore, if it does go to court, the record is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| The record is incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| The other thing is the cost of going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| As you know, the builders and developers have an exorbitant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| We citizens usually do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Therefore, this process could go for a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| costing the plaintiff, again, extra money that they may not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| which, therefore, a lot of people that I've spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| pretty much just give up on being able to move forward with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| because of the financial burden that it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| I would ask that you please allow our voices to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| and to deny this petition by our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Cindy Fertz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| I apologize if I mispronounced that, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| If you'll say it correctly and you have permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Nobody ever says it or spells it right, so it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| It's Fertz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| My name is Cindy Fertz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| because, as you've heard of the people before me and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| we just want a chance to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I'm the HOA president of Fox Ridge Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| Richie Beeler is our commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We oppose this proposal to have the courts involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| with the decisions for the appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Our subdivision has been involved in the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| We have a subdivision going directly behind us currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| And we've also been a part of the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| And, again, we just want to be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| And if you let the developers go directly to the court system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| it's going to be very prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| It's going to be cost prohibitive, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| It's going to be time prohibitive because we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| take the time to maybe speak with a lawyer or get ourselves prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| But, frankly, it's going to be very intimidating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| And I think that's the biggest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| It's hard enough to stand up here and talk with a group of yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| but to ask a regular citizen or resident to go and stand in front of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| and plead their case is something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| So, I guess just kind of to close with this, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| our subdivision is against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| We want to be able to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| And last Friday I went to vote, and there was a sign out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| and it was Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| And it said, Together We Win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| And I like to think that the together part means that the residents have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| opportunity to meet and be a part of the discussion with the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| and that the together part is all of us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| And as somebody mentioned earlier, not everything that we want happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| but we are the residents that have to live with all the decisions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| And so we ask that you keep us in mind and let us still have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you, Ms. Fiertz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=979)|

| 0:16:27| You have three minutes to address the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=987)|

| 0:16:48| and the City Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| Commissioner Daley is the Knox County Commissioner representing our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| We are pleased to say that Carson Daley has served South Knox County very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| as an awesome hands-on county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| We are opposed to requiring appeals of development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| or uses on review to be filed directly to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| We ask that you direct those appeals to the local board of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| the way it has been done for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| Our neighborhood is in the city and borders on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| This proposal impacts our input for any development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| proposed on county parcels adjacent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| With development plans, the devil is in the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and we know that sometimes it's not always possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| to get that worked out at the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Appeals to the BZA provide that opportunity to further work out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Again, I'm representing the Vestal Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| We would like to ensure that those appeals continue to be sent to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| This is an issue that the Vestal Community Association is watching over very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1088)|

| 0:18:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| My name is David Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I live at 4519 Owanna Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| I'm the current president of Town Hall East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| We have about 100 active members who come primarily from Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| Chilhowee Hills, Holston Heights, and the adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| We have two commissioners representing different sections of our membership area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| Commissioner Lundy and, since the last redistricting, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| Neighborhood associations like ours exist to allow citizens to participate more effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| in local government, and we hope you, as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| welcome that participation and want to encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| For that reason, we strongly oppose requiring appeals of development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| or use on review to be filed directly to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Developers have lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Neighborhood associations and individual citizens generally do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| The proposed changes create a kind of pay-to-play system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| You have to ante up significant funds to even be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| That is a serious impediment to citizen involvement in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and we ask that you oppose the changes in the ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you, Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Herb Anders is our next speaker, followed by Joyce Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Good evening, Herb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Good evening, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| My name is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| I reside at 8501 North Ruggles Ferry Pike, Strawberry Plains, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| On behalf of the Ruggles Ferry Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| I'm requesting that this body help preserve the rights of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| and other communities in Knox County to appeal the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| My biggest question is why this change is even on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Some of the answers that I have found to be that it's a BZA problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| not really a problem, but an issue with having quorums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| and the timeliness of decisions made that are before the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Developers and communities as well deserve a timely decision on any appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| If the BZA is not timely in their decisions, then it's a BZA problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| It's not a problem with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I would request that this issue be looked in as well as other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| that would hold up a timely decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I was privileged several years ago to serve on the Planning Commission from 2012 to 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| During this time, many difficult decisions came before that commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| One of the biggest things that came to a resolution was communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| between the applicant and any opposition that would come up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| I cannot remember the number of times that every commissioner requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| that the developer and the ones in opposition to that talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| try to come to some compromise, and it wouldn't even need to go to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| or forbid that it have to go into the court process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Neighborhoods and individuals already are very limited on having input on proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| before Planning Commission and oftentimes during the review process of Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| One of the things that I wish that could change with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| so that this process could go more smoothly, that they would be open to information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| during the agenda review process because that's where a lot of information comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| that is coming from the developer, from some of the decisions or the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| that the Planning Commissioners have, but the public is forbidden to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| at this agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| I would ask that that process be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| Last year our community was involved with a subdivision that was proposed in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| and it was totally out of character for the rural community that we live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| and it was by no means in harmony with that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| and our appeals seemingly fell on deaf ears, both from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| and from members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I would ask that the Commissioners preserve this right to have the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1408)|
| 0:23:37| Please allow it to remain as is and our communities have the right to avoid costly litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| on both sides of the issue because it's never a good thing when people have to spend money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| on litigation instead of having to spend it toward their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Joyce Feld and then Marcus Weisman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Good evening, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Good evening and thank you for letting me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| and I'm here tonight as President of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Scenic Knoxville seeks to protect and enhance the beauty and visual character of our public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| Our streetscapes and our scenic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| We believe a beautiful city is essential to its social and economic vitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Since its founding in 2008, Scenic Knoxville has frequently participated in the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| at the city, the county and the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| and we believe we've had a positive and noticeable effect on public policy, legislation and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| We are mainly concerned with the aesthetic aspects of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| such as landscaping, signage and lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| We are a grassroots organization with a large base of community support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| but we do minimal fundraising and we are not a wealthy organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| It would be extremely onerous and likely prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| to have to take an appeal of a Planning Commission decision directly to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| Some commissioners have expressed concerns about the Board of Zoning Appeals functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| and we urge you to address those concerns rather than taking the drastic step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| of eliminating BZA from the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| For example, attendance requirements could be instituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| and additional training could be provided to its members if it was deemed necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| We think it is essential that an appeal to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| remain an accessible and straightforward option open to all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Taking a case to court is daunting, intimidating and expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| Initiating litigation immediately sets up an adversarial relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| between the developer and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| while an appeal to BZA maintains the opportunity for community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| and the developer to work together towards compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| An appeal to BZA would also be resolved much more quickly than a case taken to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| thereby delaying development for a shorter period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Please preserve the community's right to continue to do what we have already been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Please amend our ordinance and codify the process of taking appeals of development plans to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Marcus Weisman and then Edward Nicholson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Good evening, sir. If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| You have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Yes, my name is Marcus Weisman. I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| My commissioner is Kyle Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| And I do appreciate your time and I will be respectful of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| My father was an elected official in county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| and he always said if you get a chance to speak to a group of elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| you need to observe the three B's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Be brief, be clear and then be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| So I will be respectful of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| But I just wanted to say don't take this right away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| This is something that has not been abused by the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| There have been, what, 16 appeals in 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| So it's not something that's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| It's something that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| We count on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| The area that I live in is developing rapidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| particularly where Commissioner Ward lives is developing very rapidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1655)|

| 0:27:45| I'm speaking on behalf of the Keller Bend subdivisions of Viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| and Mariners Point, and we have about 89 homes and over 300 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| We feel strongly that we need this avenue of involvement in the development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| and if it's taken away from us, we will lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Our quality of life will be damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| The taxpayers will lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| The courts will be clogged up more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| There will be more cost for the county court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| So taxpayers lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| The residents lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| There will be some winners in the process, but most of us will be losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| So I sincerely ask you to maintain the process that we now have that's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1716)|
| 0:28:46| and make whatever changes are needed to make it work better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| but don't take our right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Thank you, Mr. Wiesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Edward Nicholson is next, followed by Robert Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Good evening, Mr. Nicholson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| State your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Yeah, my name is Edward Nicholson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| I live at 1232 Lakeland Drive in Knoxville, and my zip code is 37919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and I'll also try to respect the three Bs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I don't think that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| I'm the vice president of the Kingston Pike-Square Hills Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| and our county commissioner is Mr. Kyle Ward, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| KPSHA represents about 1,000 households, and I'm here to speak on their behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| and express our opposition to this ordinance, or proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| We just believe that the proposed ordinance would present an unnecessary monetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and time-consuming hardship on the ordinary citizen of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| and would really slow down or make the process for pursuing an appeal very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| and as someone else said, not only is it a monetary thing, but in slowing down process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| would be very intimidating for somebody that has very little experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| But anyway, we feel like the current system works very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| We'd like to see the current system kept, and please look after our interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| Thank you, Mr. Nicholson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Robert Thompson is our next speaker, and then Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| Mr. Murphy, did you want to speak now, or did you want to speak during zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| During zoning, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Thompson, you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| You have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Robert Thompson, Knox County 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| My commissioner for the district is Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I want to talk about legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I understand you have your legal advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| but please consider the following views about the legal risks of what you're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| I've discussed these views with various experienced lawyers who believe they have some merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| although only Cliff Rogers was in a position to say so publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| which he did in a July 20th email to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| There's a good argument that regardless of what our ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| state law requires that these appeals stay with the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| You've heard a little about the 1990 Browning-Ferris Court opinion that ruled against Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| when Knox County tried to change the rules to make county commission the body to hear appeals from MPC decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| on uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| So why did the court make that ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Well, primarily the court cited the state law that requires certain appeals to go to county BZAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| Following that court decision, Knox County passed an ordinance in 1991 that established our BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| replacing what was formally called the Board of Adjustments and Enforcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| and that ordinance provided for use on review appeals to go to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| The preamble to that 1991 ordinance stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| whereas the Court of Appeals for the State of Tennessee has ruled that appeals and decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| from the Metropolitan Planning Commission must be heard, must be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| before the Board of Adjustments and Enforcements for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| That must be heard is how the county interpreted that court opinion at the time of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| and that interpretation is arguably still valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| That opinion dealt with facts that arose before Knox County adopted home rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| but the 1991 ordinance establishing BZA and giving that authority came after adoption of home rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| suggesting that the county did not see home rule as changing the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| The reasoning behind that case, that use on review appeals must be heard at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| logically applies the very same way to development plan appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Development plan applications are, of course, handled through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| If you now try to take that away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| you're inviting essentially the very same lawsuit that the county lost in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| Mr. Moyers, of course, disagrees with these views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| but I very much appreciate his cordiality and the time he's taken to discuss them with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| I'd like to add I am a member of the South Doral Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| and we did not have a regular meeting in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| but several of our key members did get together this month with Commissioner Daley to discuss this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| and there was a lot of objection to this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| We didn't have an official vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| We also discussed concerns we have heard about BZA performance issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| and we, of course, do want BZA to perform better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Michelle Ivester and then Daniel Green are our next two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2031)|
| 0:34:03| Good evening, Miss Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| If you'll state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| My name is Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| My address is on Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I'm the current president of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and I'm here representing the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood with about 3,000-plus homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| not including apartments or businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Commissioner Durrett is my commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I'm going to be brief, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Many of us have been told that we are against development in general, which is totally untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| We're just against irresponsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| Sometimes developers are not aware of issues that neighbors nearby can bring to light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| and the BZA allows us to have input to guide development of our neighborhoods for the betterment of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| Removing the development plan appeal process to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| or letting the developer applicant decide the process puts an unfair and unreasonable hardship on neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| or those who may be directly impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| Once again, I'm representing the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and have been to BZA in previous years as we feel it's important to stay aware of items that may directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| or indirectly affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Recent flooding is a huge issue in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| and again, we've been through the BZA to help guide developments that may impact our neighborhood from flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2116)|
| 0:35:25| Anyway, so that we can help bring awareness of possible problems that may occur with irresponsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| And tonight we're asking you to please codify the development plans that will be appealed to the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| so that all parties that are impacted can have a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Thank you, Ms. Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Daniel Green is our next speaker, followed by Adam Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2145)|
| 0:35:56| Welcome, Mr. Green. If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| You have three minutes to address commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Afternoon, commissioners. My name is Daniel Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| I live at 2541 Timber Highlands Lane, and I am representing Laurel Ridge Neighborhood in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| My commissioner is Ms. Terri Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Laurel Ridge represents around just north of 300 homes in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and I will keep this brief as well as I know you all have heard from the Hardin Valley community quite a lot here in the recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| Within our neighborhood, we do not have a homeowners organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| so I'm here at the behest of several residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| With this proposed ordinance, we do believe our voices will not be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| especially with the challenges in developing Hardin Valley right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| We feel that we are being more reactive than proactive here in the coming years as Hardin Valley continues to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| We want to see a more proactive approach, and we also want to make sure that us as citizens in this area are heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| Our biggest concern, again, is just that we do feel with this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| our voices will not be heard and our concerns with the continuing development will not be heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you all so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2230)|

| 0:37:19| Evening, Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| You have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2242)|

| 0:37:29| If this isn't encouraging public participation, I don't know what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| This is encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| It's been thoughtful, well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| We show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| We speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| We email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Oftentimes many of us will speak with you all individually as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| I know Commissioner Baylor, many of us have spoken in the Gibbs and Coreyton community tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| What's interesting is we speak, we send in our information, but we don't get a monthly vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| You all get to vote on these items every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| If any of you all are questioning why there's such interest and such passion over these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2293)|
| 0:38:23| this commission has made land use the number one issue in the middle of this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| It hasn't been the mayor or the mayor's office, their programs, plans, ideas, all come here for a final vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| and you all have the authority and the power as our representatives to vote on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| It hasn't been MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| Many of us have gone before MPC and spoken and emailed and felt like we didn't get anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| and then we come here, and you all have the power and the authority as our representatives to vote on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| We don't get to vote every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| It's frustrating because I've spoken before MPC many times, and it just gets through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2347)|
| 0:39:15| and when it comes here for a rezoning, every rezoning, every sector plan amendment comes here for a final vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:24| and so when we don't feel like it's been heard, it becomes more of an issue for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2364)|
| 0:39:33| and so what we're asking you all for is to side with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| Each of you asked and campaigned for our vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| and many or most of you either are or will be campaigning and asking for our vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2383)|
| 0:39:51| We're just asking for you to support us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| We trusted you with our vote to be our representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| We're just asking that you give us the same support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Megan Wiley Potts is the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| That will be followed by Katie Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2411)|
| 0:40:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| If you'll state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| My name is Megan Wiley Potts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| My address is 8845 Mallow Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| The representative in my district is Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| I am here before you, like everyone before me, to address the BZA amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| Amending the zoning ordinance should be done only if there is a strong rationale for ending a longstanding practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| An appeal to Chancery Court is much more costly than an appeal to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| making such an appeal simply unaffordable to citizens and neighborhood groups like mine in the Bexhill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| In effect, it would end the citizen's right to appeal any kind of development plan to anywhere other than the Chancery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| which is cost prohibitive for young families like mine and people in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| An appeal to BZA takes much less time than an appeal to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| Less time spent is good for both the applicant and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| I ask that you oppose the changes in the ordinance as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| and that you preserve a longstanding right that the community has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Eliminating the appeal to the BZA eliminates our ability to engage in the zoning process, and we need this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:47| I'm here representing many families in the Ebenezer Corridor, and I ask that you hear us on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Thank you, ma'am. Katie Overton. Is there a next speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2521)|
| 0:42:10| Evening, Ms. Overton. State your name and county of residence. You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| My name is Katie Overton. My address is 200 West Jackson Avenue, Apartment 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| I grew up here in Knoxville, and I'm an attorney, so I've heard a lot about Chancery Court and cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| Chancery Court works just fine, and if you have to go before the BZA, you probably need to hire me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Anyway, like I said, I grew up here. I attended grade school at Farragut. I went to undergrad at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I also obtained my law degree from UT, where I graduated top of my class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| And unlike most of my peers at UT Law, I decided to stay in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| I was blessed to obtain a job with one of the best firms in this town. Obviously, I live downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| But I don't own a home, and it's not for lack of effort. It's not for lack of frugality or lack of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| I don't go to Starbucks every day. I get free coffee at work. It's lack of inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| And I don't say this with any delusion that you're going to feel sorry for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| I realize that as an attorney from Farragut, I am the most unlikable person in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| My point, though, is if I'm having a hard time buying a house, who's having an easy time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| See, my generation, we came of age during the housing market collapse of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| We watched our parents struggle, and we learned valuable lessons about homeownership during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| And I know that it takes effort, and it's not going to be handed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Things that were considered major milestones in maturation for our parents significantly delayed for us for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2626)|
| 0:43:55| I'd argue most of them are economic. I signed up tonight to ask for y'all's help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| I can't tell you how many of my peers, the best and brightest from Farragut all the way up through law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| had to leave Knox County, had to buy homes in other counties because they simply couldn't do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| Actually, this is true, y'all. My best friend lives in Newport Beach, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| She called me the other night. She wants to move back to Knoxville, but it's going to wait a couple of years until she can afford to buy a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| She'd rather stay in Newport Beach, California than come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| It's not right. This isn't Knoxville. It's not true to who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| This is a community that's always been built around family, and my generation just wants the opportunity to build a family here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| to live here for 40 years and buy a house just like y'all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| We're not asking for a handout. We're not asking for an easy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| We're not asking to make it harder for poor people to obtain justice that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| We just want the bureaucracy to take its foot off of our neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| They're not new. They oppose basically everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Everyone's been opposing fluoride in the water, West Town Mall, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| But you can't hit pause on development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| So, we're running out of time, so I'm just going to ask you to vote to move our community forward and support the mayor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you, Ms. Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Our last speaker is Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2727)|
| 0:45:44| Good evening, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| First, I'd like to thank everyone that's here tonight expressing their opinions and their viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| It is a wonderful thing to see, so thank you all very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| Knox County is a special place, and we all want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| But currently, one of the biggest threats to our way of life is out-of-control housing prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| and the potential exodus of people who cannot afford to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| Our friends, neighbors, and almost especially our kids and grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| The ordinance change, which you are considering tonight, is designed to help make housing more available and affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| and really to protect this special place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| This proposal sprang out of the presentation that Hanson Sale from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2787)|

| 0:46:37| At that meeting, Mr. Sale pointed out that the shortage of homes in Knox County had reached critical levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| driving the cost of housing out of reach for many Knox Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| He encouraged us to adopt green tape practices in reference to policies and processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| that other communities are engaged in, practices that cut red tape and bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| Since I'm an ardent believer in cutting red tape, as I hope all of you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| I asked Jim Snowden, along with Amy Brooks, to look at our development approval processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| It turns out that our processes are actually pretty good, with one especially glaring exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| the issue currently under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| Along with Commissioner Smith, we initially proposed this change to streamline our development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| to cut red tape at a time when we needed it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| We face a housing crisis in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Since the pandemic began, housing prices have skyrocketed, an average 35% or about $70,000 per home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| This situation has become so dire that households earning $75,000 a year or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| which make up the overwhelming majority of Knox County families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| can only afford to buy about one-third of the homes on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| If this trend continues, hardworking families will no longer be able to live here, and that would be a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| The underlying problem is lack of supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| A number of factors contributing to this problem are out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| Cutting red tape is not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Cutting red tape is firmly in our power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| But because of red tape, the current process keeps developments off the market for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| But this body, Commission, can fix that with this ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| If you choose not to do so, you will have made a policy choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| that unnecessarily contributes to driving up housing costs in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| and you'll be saying that you're okay with red tape in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| As we've dug deeper into this issue, it's also become apparent that the BZA is making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| about an issue that was never supposed to be under their purview to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| It's classic mission creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| The terms use on review and development plan have become conflated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| All this proposal does is clarify that these are two different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| and subject to two distinct processes, which will eliminate redundancy and duplication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| and will also ensure that we're doing things correctly as both our ordinances and state law require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| Finally, this change in no way takes away public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| In almost all land use scenarios, the public has the opportunity for comment three different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| The proposal does not alter that, nor does it deprive the public of the opportunity for legal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Unfortunately, in the past, your predecessors have had the tendency to fold instead of making tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| You all know where I am on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Nevertheless, you have to vote your conscience, and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| I urge you to vote to make your decision based on what you think is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| not pressure from anyone else, not who's yelling the loudest, but what you think is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| That's all any of us can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| And to make a decision that you'll still be proud of 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3020)|

| 0:50:28| I want to thank all of the members of the public who showed up at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| as well as those who addressed the commission on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| Commissioners, is there any further discussion on this public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| The chair will entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-public-hearing?start=3045)|
