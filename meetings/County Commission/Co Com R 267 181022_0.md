| 0:01:02| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| As we begin tonight's meeting, or just before, I'd like to ask Commissioner Charles Bussler to lead us in tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=65)|
| 0:01:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Before I get into my devotional, you always have to have a guide or something where you go to that gives you instructions for your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=75)|
| 0:01:24| and you have to know where you find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| And in the Bible, I find a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| In 1 Peter 4.10, it says, God's gift of grace to everybody is given to them for one reason, and that is to serve others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=89)|
| 0:01:41| And so I use that when I come in here when we're doing our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| I think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| So that's one of the things I think about, and I think everybody should have some kind of motto that they live by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| So in saying that, let's go in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| O most gracious Heavenly Father, we thank you for the ability to be here to serve others and to be part of the community in which we live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=121)|
| 0:02:11| that we can look and grow and communicate with one another and to serve others over ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=131)|
| 0:02:19| So, Father God, I ask you to be with us as we conduct the meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| that we have the courage and the strength to do what is right, to represent our people in the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| and to conduct business as it should be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| So, Father God, I pray this in your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I'd like to next ask Commissioner Brad Anders to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| He will rise and play a proper salute to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=172)|
| 0:03:05| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Before we go into public forum, I would like to take just a moment to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=187)|

| 0:03:49| I didn't know he was that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I didn't know he was that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=232)|

| 0:04:15| Now, Ed's old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| Now, Charlie's young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=257)|

| 0:04:21| So thank you all so much for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=261)|

| 0:04:27| I'm going to call on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| She's on public forum, so she gets a special recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| So next, moving into public forum, we do have a very special public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=272)|
| 0:04:40| Tonight, our first speaker is going to be David Perkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| David is the Tennessee Commissioner of Safety and Homeland Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| and he is here to present a special award to John Brinkley with AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| But before you say what you're going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I wanted to really take a moment just to share with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| and our commissioners a little bit about your background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| And thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, for printing this out for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| David's first government position was judicial assistant to his mentor, Judge James K. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| You started off serving as a 9-11 dispatcher over at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Morristown-Hamblin County Emergency Management Director System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| You're a Tennessee State Trooper assigned to Nashville and the Fall Branch Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| You are a TBI Special Agent assigned to the Chattanooga region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| and a Police Accreditation Manager for the city of Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| You've also served as an officer in the Tennessee Army National Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| and the United States Army Reserves for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| You were appointed to the vacancy of Hamlin County Mayor in 1995| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| and went on to be elected four times before voluntarily retiring in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| You left Hamlin County with historically low property tax rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| the highest bond rating on its record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| and an audit that recognized Rainy Day Reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| while supporting the largest building program in your county's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| We are very lucky that Governor Bill Haslam and Commissioner-designee Bill Gibbons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| tapped you to be the fourth Governor Haslam's Homeland Security Advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| and Assistant Commissioner for the Department of Safety and Homeland Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| We are very lucky to have someone with your background, experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| both a mayor and committed to Homeland Security here to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I also understand that you commute from your hometown all the way to Nashville every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| That shows, then, even a more impressive level of commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| So I'm going to go ahead and turn the floor over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| We're thankful for you to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, mayor, sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Having been a 16-year county mayor myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| I still find myself somewhat comfortable in front of county commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| and I appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| It's a special occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| On September 11th, the governor of this state, Governor Bill Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| recognized some heroes in our midst, first responders throughout the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| that have gone above and beyond the call of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| One of those is a gentleman that's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Before I give him the citation publicly that he received at the governor's residence here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| I want to read the citation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| It will just take 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Listen to what he's responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| John Brinkley, American Medical Response, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| is being presented a governor's certificate of appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| for exceptional support to Homeland Security District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| for his professionalism exhibited in the planning of multiple deployments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| of emergency medical services personnel to areas in Texas and Florida struck by hurricanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| resulting in multiple lives being saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| John also has worked diligently to help schools in Knox County plan and train for disasters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| and mass casualty events through a series of tabletop exercises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| This is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Additionally, he worked with the Homeland Security District 2 team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| that partnered with the Tennessee Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| to develop a teacher-focused active shooter stop the bleed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| You have a good man in your midst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| His heart is in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| He is known throughout the state as being a doer, a planner, and a person that gets the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| And it's my honor to appear here tonight publicly to present him this certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| from the governor of the state recognizing him for his service to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=520)|

| 0:09:14| and I just want to make sure everybody stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| This is not an individual award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=556)|

| 0:09:34| but not only Homeland Security but the Knox County Health Department, the Regional Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| We work with KPD, Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| the Knox County School of Security, University of Tennessee Police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| all the hospitals in our region, our Knoxville-East Tennessee Health Care Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| It's a large team of people that work together to make all this come true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| and help this community and make sure that we're prepared for any type of disaster that we may face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Once again, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| We do have six folks who have signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| but I have a special public forum guest that I'd like to call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| I intentionally did not recognize her when we were recognizing elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| because I knew she was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I'd like to ask a member of our Board of Education, Evette Satterfield, to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| Ms. Scott, state officially your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| and I know she's here to give us an update on the joint education meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Evette Satterfield, District 1, 37915 is the zip code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| but yes, I'm here to give updates on the wonderful education joint committee meeting we had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| Larson was so graciously, he came and presented on behalf of the county side to the school board meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| and he just thought it would be a great idea to have me come present to you all the show that government does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| So I'll briefly give an update of the meeting that we had on October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| The committee is made up of four members from each side of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| Commissioner Evelyn Gill, Michelle Carninger, Randy Smith, and Larson Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| And then on the school board side, we have Virginia Babbs, Patty Bounds, Susan Horn, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| Larson and I were selected as co-chairs, so we're really excited about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Larson provided a comprehensive agenda, which included opportunities for us to share why we are highly invested in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| what kind of outcomes do we want because of this committee has been formed and continuing to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| and future dates for the committee meetings in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| A few presentations that we are looking to have include budget 101, breaking it down to the basics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| what's on the horizons for KCS, and how can we inform the county commission early and often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| We are also considering having a joint conference, so be on the lookout for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| All in all, it was a really successful meeting with a lot of new energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Larson is really excited to lead this, and I'm super excited to be right there beside him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| And we also want to just come together and really make sure that we do what's best for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| on behalf of the government side and the county commissioner side and the school board side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| to really make sure that government works for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| So thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| Thank you, and I'm sure lots of good things in the future, so we appreciate the opportunity to work with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| And thank you, Commissioner Jay, for stepping up to be the county, as well as all of our commissioners are serving on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| But, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Next on their public forum, we have Sandra Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| I hope I'm pronouncing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Is it if it's Cannon or Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Is Sandra here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| Okay, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| We next have a Julia Gautreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Am I pronouncing Julia's name correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| It's Gautreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Gautreau, if you state your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| My husband is French, and he would say that I mispronounce it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| My name is Julie Gautreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| I live at 313 Woodland Trace Drive in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| and I'm here to talk about the amendment to Securus's contract for inmate communication and management system that is on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=801)|
| 0:13:30| I've done a lot of work on jail visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| and I would like to read a statement to make sure that I get everything and that I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| My understanding of the Securus amendment is that it is for a large payment to the county for an uninstall of software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| I would be interested to know why Securus is paying the county to uninstall software the county never paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| My understanding is that the county has never paid Securus for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| The county has only ever received a cut of the proceeds of money paid out by the families of prisoners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| and this amendment promises to increase that cut percentage, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| I am primarily here tonight to review the history of jail visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| for which Securus is now the sole provider and has been since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| The county commission approved the contract with Securus in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| The contract did not make Securus the exclusive provider of jail visitation, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| It was not conditioned on the elimination of in-person visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| It just makes Securus the provider of technology for electronic communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| and it requires prisoners and their families to pay for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| It can be a good option, I admit, for people who can't visit in person, but it should only be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| After the commission approved the contract, Sheriff Jones eliminated in-person visitation altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| The reasons for that are not the subject of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| They are administrative sheriff's policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| But if you want to know how accurate those reasons are that they offer for the switch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| I'd be happy to provide that information to you at some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Prior to 2014, in-person visitation was standard and routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| I was a young attorney when the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility was built in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| I remember how proud that county commission and Sheriff Hutchison were of that construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| That building was actually designed around the concept of secure in-person visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| There are six connected buildings, five of which contain upper levels that consist only of secure visitation booths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| I counted 16 such booths in a single building when I was there last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| That's all they are, that and restrooms for visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| The prisoners used to be brought up to the opposite side of an impenetrable plexiglass dividing wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| from the lower level where all the prisoners are housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| The prisoners never occupied the upper level space on the visitor's side of those secure walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| It's designed that way to keep them never in that space where the visitors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| That's how securely it was designed for visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| And now all that space, tens of thousands of square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| are permanently unused except by a few attorneys and social workers and probation officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| because there's no profit margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| I encourage you to have a tour and look for yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| I am asking this commission only to ask the questions about what this payment is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| Why is Securus giving you a quarter of a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| I know it's a lot of money the county can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| I understand that the county can use that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| But I think the integrity of this commission is better served by finding out why it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Next on our public forum is Mr. Herb Moncier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Name and address for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| My name is Herbert Moncier, Suite 775, Bank of America, Building 550, Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| This is the third bouncing back and forth I think that I've had the occasion to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| on the subject of resolving the ongoing expense to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| that has been imposed upon 636 present and former members of the uniformed officer's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1063)|
| 0:17:54| They had no part in this, yet it has become a political football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| The people of Knox County are outraged by the amount of money that this litigation has brought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| where Knox County is suing itself and suing its employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Last Monday when I was here, I spoke to you and I was urging you to place the matter on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| when at my advanced stage I heard someone say it's already been put on the agenda for next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| I thought that's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| So I sat down and left thinking it was over, but then I found out I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| It had not been put on the agenda, that the debate happened after I had walked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| and it turned out that there were four people I understand who voted not to place it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| so therefore the issue lingers on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Since then I've been back to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| The court's looking for direction from the mayor, which it's gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| It's looking for direction from this commission, which it has not gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| and it is looking to determine who is in charge of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| Is it the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Is it the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Or does the law director control everything that happens in this county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| It's a big question, and it's a question that is coming forward that will be litigated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| and on behalf of the 636 people that I represent, I'm asking this commission to act tonight to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1160)|
| 0:19:31| Now, I understand that the mayor has called for an emergency session for Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| and I also understand that there are some of you who may not be able to be here Thursday for other commitments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| and I understand that, and I believe as firmly as I stand at this podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| that the important thing in life is that people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| It doesn't matter whether you're for or you are against bringing a termination to this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1194)|
| 0:20:03| Of course, I urge you to be for terminating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| But the important thing I think tonight is that those four people that voted against putting it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| at the last meeting think for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| If you happen to be one of those people who cannot be here Thursday, I don't care how you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| whether it's for it or whether it's against it, as Cass Walker would say, the important thing is that you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| And the only way you can vote is tonight, once I sit down again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| is to come forward and eight of you vote to put this on the agenda, and then either vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1236)|
| 0:20:47| Whichever way you're going to vote, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Speak, because you represent the constituency and you have an obligation to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| And quite frankly, it wasn't your making that it happened to be placed on a period of time that you might be out of town Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| Now, folks, this litigation's got to stop, and the reason we're on this push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| and the reason you've gotten involved in this push is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| We're going to be back before the court on October the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| and we're going to be debating before the court on October the 29th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| the issues that were so pungently brought to bear at the last meeting we were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And the court has asked, what has county commission done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| The court needs an answer, and it needs an answer from all 11 of you, not just those of you who can be here Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| And it needs this answer as quickly as possible for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| I've been practicing law for 48 years, and I know how attorneys bill for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| And I know, and I'm telling you, as that magic day of October the 29th comes about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| zing, jing, ching, ching, ching, you're spending more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| Why do I care about that? Because I might get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| I care about it because the 636 members of the former and current Sheriff's Department plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| don't want to be blamed for the waste of money that is going on through this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| They want that money to be available for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| They want that money to be available for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Monsier. That's five minutes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| Okay. Next on our public forum agenda is Al Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| I will cede my five minutes. I think Mr. Monsier said it eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Okay. So you do not wish to speak, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| All right. Next on the public forum is Bert Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| Thanks, Bert. If you could state your name and address for the record, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| My name is Bert Benedict. I live at 1710 Howard Road in beautiful Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| I wanted to talk to you a minute about something that was touched on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| I'd like to talk to you about restoring the visitation at the Knox County Intake Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| back to the situation where it was always known as face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| I discovered a year and a half ago that face-to-face was no longer allowed at the intake center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and it had been replaced by a Securus phone system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| For many reasons, myself and others find that objectionable and counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| In talking to others who either had been inmates or had family that were inmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| a pattern of dissatisfaction was apparent regarding the cost and performance of the system itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| Dropped calls, poor connections, etc. were common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Most were unhappy with the fact that they could not see their friends or loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| So I started doing some investigation on the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| and found that this was a common thing in facilities across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| using the Securus system with similar results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| What I also found out was quite shocking, actually, regarding Securus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| Wherever these people go, and I want you to hear what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| wherever these people go, lawsuits fall like rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| There are lawsuits against Securus in just about every state in the Union right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| about illegal business practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Now, when I got here tonight, I worked on this this weekend and I gave you all a black packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| There's a reason it's black because it's got a lot of black news in it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| It's bad news. It's bad news for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I think that if we're even involved with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| So, anyway, I'm going to leave that with you for you to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| I wanted to tell you just a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| These are things that are matters of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| These are not my opinions or my research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| From the Kansas Topeka newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| 1,300 public defender calls recorded at the Kansas prison at Leavenworth by Securus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| The result of that was that Securus passed the information gleaned in those phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| along to local attorney generals across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| which resulted in many people being convicted under, shall we say, less than honest conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1548)|
| 0:25:57| A federal judge has now granted them permission to file a class action lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| against Securus and the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Now, as this man just said, nobody likes lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| We want to avoid this, but think about that for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| They're talking about as many as 1,000 convictions in the state of Kansas could be overruled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| could be dismissed because of Securus' involvement with recording phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| So, in the state of California, they've been sued twice in the state of California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| because of this very same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And then there was a case in Boston, Massachusetts, where Securus had to contract the local sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1604)|
| 0:27:01| And by the way, I met our new sheriff the other day, and he's a fine man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| I've got a lot of confidence in him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| He's a good guy, and we need to support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| But the sheriff in Boston took a payoff of $1.7 million from Securus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| to get the contract for the jail facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| So I would hope that you all would think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| I know you're supposed to make some sort of a decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| but you need to be on your guard here because, as I said initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| wherever these people go, massive lawsuits result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| Many, many accusations have been made, and so I really appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| I'm just an average citizen, but I'm concerned about this very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Okay, that concludes our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| I know we had, is there anybody else here who would like to address commission in public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| If you could state your name and address for the record, please, and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| My name is Miriam Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I live at 2833 White Oak Lane, and that's in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| I would like to address also a similar thing that I have two colleagues who have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| the video streaming, the visitation at the jails, the jail, the Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| I feel a little nervous in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| I have chosen to find an article actually from a book, so I'd like to read this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| This is quoted from the Prison Policy Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| This is an executive summary of a book, Screening Out Family Time, by Bernadette Raguay and Peter Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1742)|
| 0:29:14| Increasing the options that incarcerated people and their families have to stay in touch benefits incarcerated individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1754)|
| 0:29:23| their families, and society at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Increasing contact is one of the surest ways to reduce the likelihood that an individual will reoffend after release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1767)|
| 0:29:38| a technical term for which is recidivism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| A rigorous study by the Minnesota Department of Corrections found that even a single visit reduced recidivism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| by 13% for new crimes and 25% for technical violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| More contact between incarcerated people and their loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| whether in person, by phone, by correspondence, or video visitation, is clearly better for individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1804)|
| 0:30:13| better for society, and even better for the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| As one Indiana prison official told a major correctional news service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| when they, the prisoners, have that contact with the outside family, they actually behave better here at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1823)|
| 0:30:35| But video visitation also has some serious drawbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| Visiting someone via a computer screen is not the same as visiting someone in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| On-site video visitation is even less intimate and personal than through-the-glass visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| which families already find less preferable to contact visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| In jails, implementation of video visitation means the end of traditional through-the-glass visitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| in order to drive people to use paid remote video visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| Video visitation can be expensive, and the families of the incarcerated people are some of the poorest families in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1879)|
| 0:31:29| The people most likely to use prison and jail video visitation services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| are also the least likely to have access to computer with webcam and necessary bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1894)|
| 0:31:44| The technology is poorly designed and implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| It is clear that video visitation industry leaders have not been listening to their customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| and have not responded to consistent complaints about camera placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| the way seating is bolted into the ground, the placement of video visitation terminals in pods of cells, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| Technological glitches can be even more challenging for lawyers and other non-family advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| that need to build trust with incarcerated people in order to assist with personal and legal affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1941)|
| 0:32:31| Most families, the end users of video visitation, are deeply unhappy with the combination of video visitation's poor quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1951)|
| 0:32:40| the cost of visitation, and the fact that jails often force the service on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| Some of the specific problems families frequently cite are without a doubt fixable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| Others are inevitable result of the failed market structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| The companies consider the facilities, not the families paying the bills, as their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| The primary complaint is apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Video visits are not the same as in-person visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| and are much less preferable to contact visits or through-the-glass visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| I certainly hope you get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| I cannot finish my statement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Video visitation should be abolished or at least reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you for your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Was there anyone else that wanted to address this in public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| Yeah, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| If you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| You've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| My name is Sandra Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| I am not a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I live in Andersonville, but I work in Knox County, and my son is incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| And I also would like to speak about the video visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| I actually have two concerns I'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| In April 2014, the Knox County Jail eliminated in-person visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| and replaced them with video calls through its contractor, Securus Technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| I'm a member of the face-to-face group, Knox Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| who's trying to bring back the in-person visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| There are incidents in which a video visit is better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| due to distance or physical handicap or sickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| I'm not suggesting you do away with the video visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I'm suggesting you have them both, the in-person visits and the video visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| For people who are older or otherwise incompatible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| computer or less knowledge of technology, not an unlikely scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| given the demographics of families of incarcerated people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| is a requirement of video-only visits could prevent them from seeing a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Research confirms that in-person visits have been found to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| institutional adjustment and psychological well-being among incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| reduce behavioral infractions and violent behavior among incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| increase incarcerated individuals' motivation to participate in programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| it lowers recidivism and increases public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| but most importantly, it maintains and strengthens the parent-child relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| reduces trauma a child experiences when they are separated from a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| A 2014 report from the Department of Justice National Institution of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| confirms that incarcerated individuals have better outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| when they receive in-person visits from family members and supportive community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| The report also said traditional in-person visiting is a best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| that should continue in all correctional settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| This view was echoed in 2016 in a position statement by the American Correctional Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| which stated, regular communication between offenders and their family and friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| is proven to aid the re-entry to society process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| With all this being said, the issue is really one of morality and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| Families are the forgotten victims of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| They are devastated by the separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| and the family's increased expense of a loved one is being incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| It's a financial burden to keep money on the phone and commissary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| and almost impossible to come up with bail and legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Not being able to physically see your loved one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| adds to the stress and unrelenting heartache of separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| Families unconditionally love each other and deserve to physically see each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| Let us never forget that no matter what, a family is a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| whether in church or in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Nothing changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| and I hope that none of you or anyone in your family ever experiences being put in prison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| and the heartache of separation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| but many of your constituents do know the unrelenting heartache of separation from their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| and the added financial burden it brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Okay, do we have any other folks from the public who would like to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| Okay, seeing none, we will move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| For our commissioners and for the public who may be following us on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| we're at item number D, which is honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| I've got a little bit of housekeeping that I'd like to take care of as it relates to our agenda specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| If you would mind looking at, we've got agenda item F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| which is amendments and finalizing our agenda as we begin to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| The amendment related to this honorary resolution was added at last week's work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| and then has to be approved to be added tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| I guess when we made those rules, we did not anticipate honorary resolutions being added at our work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| because usually we would set our agenda and then go back and add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| So if this is acceptable for everyone to kind of stay with our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| and we've gone back and forth on this, I'd like to have a vote to add item one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| so that we can then complete the honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| We will then move on to approval of the minutes of the previous meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| and then when we get to item number F, we will move on to the other ads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| which are item 2941, a discussion around the Forensic Center, and to officially defer items 35 and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2303)|
| 0:38:34| Looking around, is that acceptable to my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Okay, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2323)|

| 0:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Okay, now on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Item number D, honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Consideration of a resolution honoring Strategy, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| upon the occasion of its receipt of the 2018 Veteran-Owned Business Achievement Award by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Before we get this ready to record, I'm going to go ahead and call on Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| You nominated him for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| This is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Yeah, the proper way to do this is we just voted to add this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| so now we'll need to have a motion to approve this, a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| and then under discussion we can go ahead and read the resolution, if that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, the motion was made by Commissioner Biggs and seconded by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Now that we have a second on the table, we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| I gained knowledge of the company here based out of Knoxville, Tennessee, Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| that Strategy, LLC, actually won an award with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce being a veteran-owned business here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| and I thought it would be great if we could acknowledge Dan Hurst and his amazing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| And I believe, to my knowledge, as of October 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2400)|

| 0:40:13| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| What I might ask, would we like to have Adam Clerk go ahead and read that resolution to the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2418)|

| 0:44:12| This award ceremony at the U.S. Chamber was called the Dream Big Gala,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| and I sat here thinking about some of the things around home and carns that got me started as an entrepreneur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| selling homegrown tomatoes and digging earthworms and reselling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2664)|

| 0:45:50| And I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| If you recall from the e-mail that went out, you should have received three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Madam Clerk reminded me that that e-mail went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| We had meeting minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| If you recall, we had a special session when we had to approve the bonds as well as our prior meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| So we have three sets of meeting minutes that we do need to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2777)|

| 0:46:19| Motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders and it has been seconded by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| That motion, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2795)|

| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Now to set our final agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| At last week's work session, we agreed to add item 1, 29 and 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| Earlier in this meeting, we added item 1 to complete the resolution recognizing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| I'd now like to formalize for tonight's session item 29, 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| We all received an e-mail from Drew that I forwarded to, I'd like to add this at the very end of the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| a discussion on a visit to the forensic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| John had sent us an e-mail with some date options that is in your inbox if you haven't had a chance to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| That would be the last item added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| That would be, I guess, item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| But we would just add it at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| And then we had items 35 and 36 that were to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| Are there any other additions or changes for tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2856)|
| 0:47:47| Motion to add what we're going to add and defer what we're going to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker has made a motion to set the agenda whereby we'll be adding items 29, 41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| the forensic center visit discussion, and we will be deferring items 35 and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| That motion was made by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Second has been made by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| Yes, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| We've had the discussion, and you guys received a copy of the resolution for this upcoming Thursday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| and I have copies if there's people that want to have that meeting tonight added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| I'm not going to push the matter, but I'm giving everybody the option of adding it to the agenda tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| and open that up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| Would you like to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| I'll make a form of the motion that we add the agenda item from Thursday's meeting to this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| if everybody doesn't want to come back from the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| It would have to be two-thirds vote, but that's up to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| 39, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| You're talking about 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| The motion on the floor was to set the agenda based on 2941 and a forensic center visit and defer 35 and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2956)|
| 0:49:26| I'll make a substitution to add the Thursday special call meeting to tonight's agenda to save folks money and time from coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2966)|
| 0:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| The second has been made by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| I also recognize, so we have a motion to substitute that by Commissioner Anders to approve the adds and the defers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2984)|
| 0:49:53| and add the item in addition related to the settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| That has been properly substituted, seconded by Carringer, and I'm now opening the floor up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=2999)|
| 0:50:08| The first light I see is Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I also recognize Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| I'll go to Commissioner Wright first and Daly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Go ahead, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| First, I'm not prepared this evening to speak on the issue that has been advertised for which there is no one attending tonight to talk about the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3019)|
| 0:50:31| because it's been advertised to be talked about Thursday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| I cannot support this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3043)|

| 0:50:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| I've already canceled my reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| I will be here Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So either way, I'll be here Thursday no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| So my reservations have been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3056)|

| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I think everybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I think it would be more proper with Commissioner Wright's comment about people being here and reservations have been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| And for those that want to be here, they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And so I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3079)|

| 0:51:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| So we are back to the original motion which was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| Now I'm noticing the light from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3092)|

| 0:51:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3105)|

| 0:53:57| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3237)|

| 0:54:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Motion approved by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| but I also see two lights, so we have a proper motion and a second on table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| I first saw, I believe it was Commissioner Daly's light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| and I also saw Commissioner Smith's light as the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I guess this will be as good a time as any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| On November the 6th, I've reserved room 540.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| BMX USA and BMX Knoxville will be here in town with the meeting with the mayor, I believe, early that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| And then that afternoon they would like to meet with any commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| The only room that Drew could find for us was 540, which I think is a very small room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| But I may change it to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| I'll get with the middle school and see if we can meet over at the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| and that way everybody can see the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| So kind of leave November 6th around 4, 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Open it in your calendars, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Commissioner Smith, I now recognize your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| I was under the impression we were going to pull that line off and postpone it until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| It was pulled off last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| So that is pulled, but I guess Commissioner Daly was just bringing it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| because we were on the subject of line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Is that correct, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| I see a phantom light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Commissioner Skinmaker, do you have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Does the maker of the motion want to just clarify it's only the three pages that are currently on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| Yeah, the BMX was pulled last week, I think, so it's just not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| So to be clear, as referencing last week's meeting to make sure we know exactly what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| this motion regarding line item transfers is to approve all line item transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| specifically not to include the line item transfer related to the BMX track, which was pulled at last week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| So we're all clear on what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Now we have a proper first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3366)|

| 0:56:25| There are 165 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| The motion to approve was made by Commissioner Wright and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=3393)|

| 1:11:45| Nominations do not require a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| The application of a nominee for a vacant position shall represent the nominee's willingness to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| in that position if appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| The commission chair shall also allow registered voters of the county an opportunity to submit names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| to the commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| The names may be submitted in writing to the chair prior to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| or may be submitted in person at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| In order for a name to be considered, a member of commission must subsequently nominate the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Nominators may speak about their nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Nominees may speak about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| After nominations are ended, nominations shall be closed by motion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| The chair will then call for discussion by commissioners regarding all the nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| After each commissioner has afforded ample opportunity to express his or her views and responding views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| the chair will ask if all commissioners are ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| If any commissioner wants further discussion, further discussion shall be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| When discussion is complete, voting will commence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| By roll call vote, each commissioner may vote in favor of one nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| And this is where the really important part is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| When discussion is complete, voting will commence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| By roll call vote, each commissioner may vote in favor of one nominee by name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| and the nominee with the least number of votes is disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| So basically we all will be nominating from this list of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| We'll have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| As we go through the votes, each person who has the least number of votes will be dropped from the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| If there's a tied vote, the chair will invite the nominators and remaining nominees to speak again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| and the chair will invite further discussion by commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Voting will resume until a nominee receives the majority of the votes of the membership of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| Forgive me for reading that out there, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| Sometimes we forget in these meetings that we have folks at home who don't know what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| and I thought it was good to point these rules out that we'll be following tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Notice your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| If the candidates for the ethics position are here, could they come to the podium and say their names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| I just, you know, I miss the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| And one thing I'm going to ask the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| We had a public hearing last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| And I thought it might be helpful for this commission to know who actually showed up for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| because it's been a week, and a week can be a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| So what I'm going to ask the clerk's office to do is share with us, or if you share with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| I can read out the names of folks who actually were at last week's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| And if you've got someone who maybe is on this list but who wasn't here last week or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| we'll give them a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Based on the advice from and counsel of our clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| I've got a list of the folks who were actually at the work session last week that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| One is John Ashley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| Laurie Boudreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| Thomas, I believe he goes by Matt Vigiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| David Gillette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Gary Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| And Mary Linda Schwartzbart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| That was six total folks out of the 12 who submitted an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| I'm looking around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Does that all ring a bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Commissioner Gill, do you know someone who wanted to address commission on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| No, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| I just wanted to see if the candidates tonight are here so that we can see who actually came back tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| I guess I am curious who all is here tonight that is on this list in case we have any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| I'm going to go to John Ashley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| I think I saw John here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Laurie Boudreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Is Laurie here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Is Laurie here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Matt, Thomas Vigiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Vigiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Vigiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| And then David Gillette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Is David here in case we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| And by the way, it was clear last week you really had to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Someone may have thought that they didn't have to be here tonight, but I know the commissioner wants to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Gary Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Is Gary here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| And Mary Linda Schwartzbart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Is Mary Linda here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| And are there any other candidates who applied for this job here who were not at the publicly called session last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4569)|
| 1:16:19| If you speak now or forever, hold your peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| If that's acceptable for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| John, would you make that in the form of a motion just so that we've got everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| I'd like to make a motion since Evelyn wasn't here last week that the four remaining candidates just give a quick, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| two-minute max introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Was that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| I don't need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| I mean, we don't need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| He said make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| The chair will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| I'll grant you that at the chair's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| So we do have four of the candidates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I'll give you each two minutes just to kind of come back if you'd like to make your case again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| John, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| John Ashley, 8805 Wakerley Place Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Sorry, I didn't come prepared tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| No, I put my name in the hat for this because I feel that, you know, I've got the heart of a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| I've wanted to do and continue to do things to serve the public, to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| I don't have the flashiest resume of titles, but I'm a hard worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| I feel that anything that I do is completely ethically and morally correct and right, and that's just how I lead my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| That's how I was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| And I'll do the same if appointed to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| And next clerks took my seat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Matt, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| You've got to say his last name right first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| No, I'm not going to try to say his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| It's a good East Tennessee Italian name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| It's so easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Go ahead, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Members of the commission, my name is Matt Faggiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| I'm a resident 1504 Bailey Park in the Choteau area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| I'm currently director of Homeland Security Safety Risk Management and Training for the North City Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| I put my name in the hat for this because as an almost 20-year government employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| I think I'm very familiar with some of the guidelines, the ethics that's required of us as government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| what we can and can't do, what's expected of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| especially by the folks that we're held accountable to being either the taxpayers or the rate payers, citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| I also think that my age and my generation should become more involved in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| and so I'm taking that step to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Next we have Gary, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Gary Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| Our colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| I haven't heard that in a long while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| My name is Gary Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| I live at 1158 Bishop's View Lane in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| I was born and raised here in Knoxville and had a military career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| I came back almost 11 years ago when my father was in bad health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| I needed to be close to family to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| So when I saw the public announcement for this opportunity, I felt a responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4775)|
| 1:19:44| a public service responsibility, because I do have a background in the realm of managing ethics in large organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4784)|
| 1:19:54| I've looked at ethics from a business perspective, from an educational perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4794)|
| 1:20:04| and I've served five years as an Inspector General for the Adjutant General of South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| During that time, I was really surprised by some of the things that I encountered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| but it was very much a school of hard knocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| so I felt a responsibility to put my experience to work for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| I'm not beholden to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| I don't have a grudge or an ax to grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| My sole motivation for this is out of public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| and with your trust and confidence, I would hope to serve the citizens of Knox County very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Mary Linda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4848)|
| 1:20:58| I'm Mary Linda Schwartzbart, 5200 Buckhead Trail, 37919 District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| I grew up in North Knoxville, and I'm a proud graduate of Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| and I'm a graduate of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| I'm also proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| I've been active as a community volunteer in addition to my professional work as a business and grants consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| and I serve both private businesses and a number of nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| My work experience started with a family business where I worked for, well, for 17 years I was controller of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| but my first job, as somebody asked, was when I was 10 years old and sold records at a retail record store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| I troubleshoot problems with clients, and I provide grant writing support for a number of clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| and I do other tasks as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| As I said last time, my standard new client interview includes that I will do anything that's legal and ethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| I love our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| It's a pleasure to serve it in the variety of ways I've been able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| and if selected tonight, I commit to working with the Ethics Committee on the issues to resolve them appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| and look forward to training and working with the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| and it's a privilege to be here tonight with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| In accordance with the rules that are recently reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| the proper way we're going to do this is we will go on a roll call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| and each commissioner will have the opportunity to place a name in for nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| Once we've completed that, is that going to suffice as our votes for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| I want to verify, even after the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| So each name will come through, then we'll vote on them after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| I'm going to ask the clerk's office, who is the-go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| Yeah, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| Do the applicants know that there is not a regularly called meeting or that this could be called at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4962)|
| 1:22:50| And in that situation, are they still willing and able to serve on that kind of committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4970)|
| 1:23:00| Well, I could go ahead and share that based on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| I have not served on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| I believe Commissioner Schoonmaker was the commission delegate to that non-voting member of that committee this past term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| So would you share what-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| We do have basically regularly scheduled meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| We used to meet quarterly, and then in the last six months we've gone monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| and it's usually to add new members to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| So we do have a meeting in November, but no meeting for December is scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| In accordance with the, I guess, precedent, I remember I told you all we would rotate where we start our roll calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| So the clerk's office is tracking that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| So the first person I'm going to go ahead and start with, actually, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| if you could start the roll call with Commissioner Daley to see if you'd like to put a name and nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5028)|
| 1:23:55| Okay. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Yes, I'd like to nominate Mr. John Ashley, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5037)|

| 1:24:08| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5048)|

| 1:25:46| So the initial nomination began with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5146)|

| 1:27:52| Six is the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5272)|

| 1:27:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| We had, I want to verify with this rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| but we did have one candidate who received a majority of the votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| Ms. Mary Linda Schwartzbart got six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5285)|

| 1:33:02| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Mr. Lilly, would you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5584)|

| 1:33:31| we went over an ordinance that we were working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| I guess my question is, the ordinance that we were working on at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| is this the noise ordinance here that we just read off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| Is that going to replace that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Or is what we were doing, is that done and gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Is that gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| This is to amend that ordinance, the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| That was the last item that was read to make the amendments that you proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| which were the changing of the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| So it's basically what we discussed that day in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5640)|

| 1:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5649)|

| 1:34:14| Or is there anything else you'd like to share with Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Just to say that this is a normal thing that the building codes department does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| to stay in compliance with state laws that say that we have to be current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| with our adopted codes within seven years of the code that is published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| And the current published code is the 2018 ICC building and fire codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| So we're just following state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5680)|

| 1:35:48| That passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Would you like to go ahead and officially read out the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5749)|

| 1:35:57| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Section N in our commission agenda is ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| We do not have any ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| Section O is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Do we have any folks who may have come in late that would like to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| moment to address county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Seeing none, I'm going to move on to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| Some of these will be this first one as a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| This is an item that we began to review at our finance committee meeting last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| week until we ran out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker has taken a lot of ownership on this to share with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| I'm going to call on Commissioner Schoonmaker for item 41, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Hopefully you still have from your packet from the finance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| What we did is just a quick recap of the status of the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| of Revenue as far as their collections go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| As you can see on the first page that was in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| the state and two months' worth of collections is up $150 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| which is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Then on the second page you can see the fourth largest counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| that are highlighted in the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| You can see where they stand in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| As an example, Davidson County, $69 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Hamilton County, $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Knox County, $32.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| Then, of course, Shelby County, $52 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| Then on the last two pages, it was just a quick recap to just show you what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| entities in the state as far as sales tax go, what entities are up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| and which ones are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| Some of the ones that are up are lumber and building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| new motor vehicle dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| Some of the losses were new stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Just for your education is the reason we did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| so you can have an overview of what's going on in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| But the good news is the state of Tennessee is doing awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| And you may recall that last fiscal year the state was up $703 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, for bringing that to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| The next item, this is an item that I had Drusilla email all of the commissioners on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| John Lott, who leads our Regional Forensic Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| has invited commission to come for a tour of that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| which does not just serve Knox County, it serves our entire region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| And it's a very important program for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| The dates that were available were in the email that I had forwarded to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| But I'd like to bring that up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| Number one, let me know if this is something you all would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| And then secondly, get some advice on how we would like to proceed to picking a date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| because there were multiple dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Basically, John said, here's all the dates you saw, all the dates I'm not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| And so I'll review those dates for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| October 26, not available in the afternoon or evening, so that morning would be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| October 29, not available in the afternoon, but will be available in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| November 2, not available in the afternoon or evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| November 5, not available in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| November 7, not available in the afternoon, but available in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| November 8, not available in the afternoon, but would be available in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| November 9, not available in the afternoon or evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| November 12, not available in the afternoon or evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| November 15, available in the afternoon, but not available in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| Then November 20, 21, 22, and 23, not available in the afternoon or evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=5999)|
| 1:40:08| Mr. Chairman, could we maybe utilize the commission forum where we could post which days would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6008)|
| 1:40:16| and then we can kind of consolidate, because I think this would be a great opportunity to tour the forensic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| I'd agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Yes, go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| In reading the email, I don't see any mentions of mornings, other than they were saying that basically they don't really do tours until after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6027)|
| 1:40:34| Is that right, they don't do tours until afternoon, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| All right, so it's forum, I think it's forum is a good way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| Well, we will, but I also think it's important to bring this up so that our public knows exactly kind of what we're up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| and when we get a date to find on the forum, we'll make sure that it is duly noted with a public announcement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6047)|
| 1:40:56| So is everybody in agreement on how we're going to move forward on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| For this, just a simple nod of heads will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| I can only imagine why we don't want to be there in the morning, and I think I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| I'm sure you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| I would make a suggestion, why don't we do it October the 31st at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| Well, thank you, Commissioner Bussler, but that would be kind of scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| All right, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Item 43, an addition that Commissioner Smith added to our agenda, is a discussion item on the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker resigned his seat on the pension board, so we do need to reappoint a seat from this body to that pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| I'll go ahead and call on Commissioner Smith since we brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Also, we do have similar rules in the county commission rules, kind of similar that we can review as it relates to appointing to a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| But go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| I just wanted to check and see when we were going to try to fill this position as it is an important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| And the way it sits now, it looks like we will have a pension board meeting without an empty seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6122)|
| 1:42:10| And I also wanted to give Commissioner Schoonmaker an opportunity to, if he wished to, let his colleagues know why he chose to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6130)|
| 1:42:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you told me that you wanted to talk about that after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| That was something unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| I thought if it was going to go on, since it was not on an agenda for today, that it would go on the work session agenda for November for selection by this body to appoint a new representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6152)|
| 1:42:45| And at that time, I was going to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| Operationally, based on our rules, that seems appropriate that this would come out of the work session in November on exactly following through on replacing you on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6169)|
| 1:43:00| And we do have specific rules in place on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Mr. Law Director, on this replacement, can we hold a special meeting prior to the work session so we can get them in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| Because they will have a meeting the week following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| That would be the best way to go to get them where they will be able to serve on the meeting before the actual commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| So 15, 20, 30 minutes before work session, we need to have a special meeting just for that purpose, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| That would be your discretion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| I think that's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| That would be my instinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| I'm saying is that Commissioner Jay's light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| And I also acknowledge that although it's hidden behind the sign that Commissioner Carringer's light is on, I'll get to hers next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| I just wanted to address Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| We had a meeting today with a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| You had talked about when the next meeting was, but it was this afternoon at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| And Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Yes, I was just looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Workshop is November 19th, and assuming that we will have a beer board, it would be at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6246)|
| 1:44:16| It may be shifted forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| No, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| We do have Sarah's bridal from 3 to 5, so don't forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6262)|

| 1:44:29| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| You're invited, Mr. Anders, so tell your wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| Well, our work session in November is actually scheduled for the 13th of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| If you recall, that's Veterans Day on the 12th, and that is a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| That is the day of our actual work session on the 13th, so it could be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6292)|
| 1:45:02| Once again, back to this, if we wanted to have a special meeting to take care of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| the pension board would be meeting on the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| so you could have a specially called meeting on the 13th, 30 minutes before our work session started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| if that's the desire of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| Do we need to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| No, you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| Generally speaking, I'm seeing nodding heads on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| I will add and I'll have it properly noticed to have a meeting to vote on this on November 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| Our work session starts at 5, so we'll plan on it being at 4.30, if that suits this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6340)|
| 1:45:49| Chairman, the body needs to send you six requests on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6349)|
| 1:45:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| We will post that to the forum and we'll get six requests, and then you can add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| And then add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| Can the chairman not put out the called meeting and has to have six confirmations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| It says that the commission membership shall petition and then the chairman shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6372)|
| 1:46:19| Can we not just do that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Mr. Chairman, can we petition you right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| If that would work, we can petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| You can petition independently if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| It's not a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| You're just saying I would like to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I would like to have by a show of hands a petition to call this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| But your rule says online in the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| I will post it online and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| I think we know what we want to accomplish on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| And, Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you want to address that at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| I just wanted a couple of minutes to address my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| Many of you are aware that I've been voluntarily working the last two years on legislation to save Knox County an annual cost of $600,000 from a fee that is charged by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6416)|
| 1:47:10| I've recently taken on an initiative working with our Register of Deeds Nick McBride to bring awareness of his issue in his office regarding a fee that he's being charged with in excess of $470,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6430)|
| 1:47:27| This week I'm going to have an opportunity to attend the fall conference of county mayors and county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6447)|
| 1:47:36| And I will have an opportunity to actually interact potentially with about 70 county mayors and about 500 county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6456)|
| 1:47:45| In preparing for this opportunity, I had arranged meetings with county mayors and commissioners to brief them one-on-one on these two critical issues that benefit all counties in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6465)|
| 1:47:59| I believe this is a valuable opportunity for me to pursue to save Knox County over a million dollars a year annually, which will benefit all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6479)|
| 1:48:11| Therefore, I will not be attending the special called meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| It's regrettable when we have an online commission calendar with all related commission events posted and it's available to everyone, including the public, that that calendar was not utilized in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6498)|
| 1:48:36| And I regret that that caused that we could not have had this meeting on the following day, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| Thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| Okay, that gets us to the end of our formal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| Before we close the meeting out and have a brief break before we go into zoning, I'd like to see if any commissioners have announcements to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6538)|
| 1:49:08| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| I think it's interesting, earlier there was some comment made that there was going to be a bridal shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6556)|
| 1:49:25| A few weeks in advance of this, 53 years ago, my spouse had bridal showers and that was leading up to October the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6565)|
| 1:49:40| So, tomorrow, my wife and I will be celebrating our anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6580)|
| 1:49:48| Now, that's not on the commission calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| But I wanted to say that in advance of a meeting we're having Thursday, a meeting which was originally maybe thought to be on the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6595)|
| 1:50:09| I just want people to know tomorrow, the next day, maybe the next day, there's no need to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6609)|
| 1:50:21| I've got three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Second thing is I wish to thank the Director of Public Health here in Knox County, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6623)|
| 1:50:31| for the very firm and focused push that she is placing on Knox County to get a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6631)|
| 1:50:42| Please, I say it to my fellow county residents, go get a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| You may be the person that breaks the chain of other people getting the flu because you don't get the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6649)|
| 1:50:57| So, again, Dr. Buchanan, thanks for Knox County's push on flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| And then the last thing is that Commissioner Gill and I attended the Soil Conservation District meeting this past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6664)|
| 1:51:15| it was Thursday or Friday of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| Sometimes when you say soil conservation, you think of just a group of farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler, and that's the best way to place it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| It's a meeting of farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| But soil conservation should be a priority of all residents in Knox County because you have a yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6694)|
| 1:51:46| you have a sidewalk, you have drainage, which brings me then to my little green card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6706)|
| 1:51:59| The Soil Conservation District is pushing along with Knox County, I'll call it stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6719)|
| 1:52:09| There are grants available in Knox County to help people with septic drainage, sewage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6729)|
| 1:52:18| treatment facilities that are on private property, and three or four drainage areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6738)|
| 1:52:29| I think primarily of Flat Creek and Roseberry, but I believe Commissioner Daley may also say Stock Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6749)|
| 1:52:39| and there are others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| So if you have questions of Knox County related to septic systems for sewage treatment, residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6760)|
| 1:52:49| you can call 215-5540 and they'll be happy to talk to you about soil conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6769)|
| 1:53:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| I'm going to recognize the lights for announcements in a clockwise motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| On October the 30th, Dogwood Elementary has got what they call a riding cafe for the fourth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| If you're available at 8 o'clock in the morning, come out and see these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| They write stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| They write poetry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| You get to go around the table and hear their stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| That's at Dogwood at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Ask a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| We'll be at the great G&D Deli, one of the best hamburgers you ever ate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| And then on November the 15th, let's remember, I know we'll have a meeting before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| but the principle for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| How many here have been to principle for a day before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| It's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Get a hold of Abby Harris, I believe, and sign up for principle for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| Pick a school, elementary, middle, and sign up to be a principle for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6833)|
| 1:54:07| Okay. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| I just want to encourage everybody in the public and, of course, our group here that Tuesday, November 6th, is, of course, Election Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6850)|
| 1:54:18| Please participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Please vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| And Friday, November 9th, I look forward to seeing everybody at the Veterans Day Parade in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| where I will be joining Pac 757 Boy Scouts, driving the old grandpa truck, leading the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| So I hope to see everybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| All right. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| Last week I had an opportunity to do a ribbon cutting for a brand-new business in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| It's the Old Dominion Freight Lines, and they built a new transportation hub off of Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6886)|
| 1:54:54| And what was encouraging to see as far as new development, not only is it a first-class facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| but they purchased 40 acres, but the company is only using 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| So the hillside behind their property will continue to be natural, which makes East Tennessee look so beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6906)|
| 1:55:16| So I commend Old Dominion Freight Lines for really stepping up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| And if you get a chance, drive by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| It's a phenomenal facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| I just wanted to remind all of us and anybody in the audience and listening that this Thursday at 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6932)|
| 1:55:41| they will have the firefighter memorial that's over at the main station, 900 East Hill Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6941)|
| 1:55:49| to remember those who have passed this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| Also, this coming Saturday, October the 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| the Girl Scouts will be down at Westtown Mall in front of the JCPennies in the children's play area from 11 to 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| doing a get out the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| So they've got like a simulator where they're bringing in children and all to learn how to cast their votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6967)|
| 1:56:16| And also, since Commissioner Wright mentioned his anniversary tomorrow, I wanted to wish my mother a very happy birthday today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6976)|
| 1:56:24| It's her 84th birthday, and she is working in the elections at Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| So I hope to be going like she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| So thank you, Mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| I wanted to remind everybody I believe Evelyn turns 29 tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| It's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Is it Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| Well, does she want the happy birthday today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| It's Thursday. I almost said, but I was like, well, we'll be back together on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| Good announcement, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| All right. I have one announcement for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| We were going to do this at Brewster's, but we're worried about the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| But City Council Member Andrew Roberto and our counterpart on the school board, Virginia Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| and I are planning on a community forum in our general district on November 8th that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7040)|
| 1:57:29| Some more details to follow as we're going back and forth on locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| We're probably going to move it indoors instead of outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| Seeing no other lights regarding announcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| I'm going to go ahead and bring this meeting of the Board of Commissioners of Knox County to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7060)|

| 1:58:42| 6-A-18-SP is a request of Ken Guillory for East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7122)|

| 1:58:56| Properties located Southside Strawberry Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| east of East Governor John Severe Highway in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| Okay. You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Before that, I do want to share with the Commission an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| I was going to do this when we got to it, actually, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| We'll do that when we come to that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| Do we have a motion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| I got thrown off with these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| I'd like to hear from MPC staff on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| Amy Brooks here representing the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| So the Planning Commission recommends amending the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| to GC General Commercial and SP Stream Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| and recommend that Knox County Commission also adopt the Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Seven to five was the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Is there anyone here who is opposed to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| I am here on behalf of Mr. Gilreath, who is also here tonight, along with Mr. Witt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| in support of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Once again, is there anybody who is opposed to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| I would like to make a motion to approve this sector plan change per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| We have a motion from Commissioner Wright to approve this per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| The first second I heard was from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| The next item is item number 43, which is also related to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| It's 6-C-18-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| It's also a request of Ken Gilreath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| It's for rezoning from A, Agricultural, and F, Floodway, to C, General Business and F, Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| The property is located southside Strawberry Plains Pike, east of East Governor John Sevier Highway, Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| Is the applicant here a representative for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Arthur Seymour, Jr., along with Mr. Gilreath and Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| We'd like to speak on the rezoning application, if we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| Before you speak, I'm going to ask if there's any here in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| The Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| And after you go, I'm going to ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| I may have skipped ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| I do want to see if our MPC would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| So, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| Just to share the recommendation of the Planning Commission, which was to approve the rezoning to P, C, Plan, Commercial, and F, Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7324)|
| 2:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| Now, go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Mr. Gilreath originally applied for C, A for this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| because he owns a tract immediately to the east of it on Strawberry Plains Pike that is zoned C, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7341)|
| 2:02:29| as well as a large farm which adjoins all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| In reviewing the MPC recommendation, we found that the P, C zone states that it's typically appropriate for 20 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7355)|
| 2:02:46| but more concerning to him than that is the issue of setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| The C, A zone has a 20-foot setback from the edge of pavement of a public road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| and that may be the distance from the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| which is going to be reused on the property from the pavement of Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7380)|
| 2:03:08| The P, C zone has a 50-foot setback, and we do not come close to meeting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| Although the tract is about six acres, a good part of the back part is taken by the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7395)|
| 2:03:23| There are buildings on this property which Mr. Gilreath intends to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| His initial aim is to sell, I'm going to call them golf carts, but they are low-speed vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7408)|
| 2:03:40| You see them, and you can get, actually, titles for them and run them on the roads under certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7420)|
| 2:03:48| You see them around town and the campus at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| For that reason, we would request zoning the original request, which was C, A. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7433)|
| 2:04:02| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| Once again, I'll ask, is there anyone here opposed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| Thank you. The Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion that, in preparation of making a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7451)|
| 2:04:19| sometime last week, rural metro had a groundbreaking across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7459)|
| 2:04:27| and I, along with Commissioner Jay, attended that groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| It gave me the opportunity to have a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| It's always nice to have a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| It's like taking a bath and going to two meetings, you know, that you don't waste a bath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7480)|
| 2:04:48| This particular piece of property had been commercial probably way before zoning was adopted in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7488)|
| 2:05:00| and it's my opinion that it probably was improperly recognized when zoning took effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7500)|
| 2:05:09| In other words, it should have been commercial at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| Changing the sector plan just fits in with recognizing a mistake had been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| If it had been commercial at that time, it would have just been commercial A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| So the recommendation of MPC that it be now rezoned, planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7528)|
| 2:05:38| does not make whole this property as it would have been if it had been recognized commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7538)|
| 2:05:45| when it should have been recognized commercial as zoning took place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| So my motion is going to be that this request of Ken Gilreath of rezoning from A, agricultural, and F, floodway, to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7551)|
| 2:06:09| the application be approved, not the recommendation of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7569)|
| 2:06:15| So my motion is that, as I've stated, it be zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| Okay. There's a proper motion from Commissioner Wright and a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7585)|
| 2:06:32| Excuse me, Commissioner Buster, I was looking at Daley's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| So we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| The first commissioner I'll call on is going to be Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| I, too, agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| Being on the John Sevier Corridor Study Group, which we will have before commission hopefully in the next four to five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7612)|
| 2:07:00| this fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| We want to make sure that commercial goes for commercial and residential stays as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| And this fits perfectly for what we have been meeting for for the last five, six meetings on the corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7627)|
| 2:07:14| and very familiar with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| I don't understand why it wasn't commercial in the first place because there's been commercial stuff there at certain points in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| So I agree with Commissioner Wright and I will vote affirmative for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| Is there a, yes, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| This comment is for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| So what would be the advantages other than commercial you could do anything and MPC voted general commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7654)|
| 2:07:43| The planning commission voted to recommend planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| I'm sorry, planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| And they articulated that they preferred the planned commercial because they knew that it would come back to them for additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7671)|
| 2:08:00| And it's been an existing, it says in the documents here, an auto lot for a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| That's what we've been told, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| Okay, is there any other discussion on this, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| So the applicant and their representative and MPC are asking for what's printed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7697)|
| 2:08:26| but Commissioner Wright is proposing something completely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| I just want to make sure I'm clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Go ahead, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| Could you clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| The applicant requested one thing and MPC recommended a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7716)|
| 2:08:44| The applicant requested commercial A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| The Metropolitan Planning Commission said planned commercial is the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| The reason that, in my opinion, planned commercial does not work is because, well, as Councillor Seymour stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7732)|
| 2:09:02| their building is closer to the property line on this parcel than even planned commercial would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7742)|
| 2:09:13| But my argument is that to make this property whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| it should have been zoned commercial when zoning took place because it was a commercial entity at the time zoning took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7758)|
| 2:09:28| So if it had been commercial then, it would now today be commercial A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| I might, speaking as the 4th District County Commissioner, not as the Chair, if I might weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| I had the opportunity to attend one of the John Sevier Corridor planning meetings hosted by both MPC and Commissioner Daley a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7782)|
| 2:09:55| Knowing how involved Commissioner Daley has been in that organization and trying to do the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| that organization seems to have their ducks in a row and are making good long-term plans for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| And if Commissioner Daley, who has been a leader there, is speaking in favor of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| while he is wearing his hat as a member of that particular group, speaking not as the Chair but as the 4th District Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7809)|
| 2:10:16| I would be in favor of that, really just based on that planning association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| which I had the pleasure to come as the guest of Mr. Daley and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7821)|
| 2:10:30| Okay, so we do have Commissioner Wright, you made your motion and it was seconded by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| All right, we'll vote all in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| All right, the next item is item 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| There has been a change to this item before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| I'm going to read into the record an e-mail that I got from the real estate broker who is representing the seller of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7855)|
| 2:11:02| This e-mail came to the Chair from Laura Bailey at 3.52 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| Mr. Nystrom, per the request of the current owner, Dixie Drummonds Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| and then in parentheses, Odra C. and Ruth W. Drummonds, who now reside in North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7872)|
| 2:11:18| please withdraw the zoning request, request hashtag 6-G-18-RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7878)|
| 2:11:26| on the agenda this evening for PR zoning on the property located at 7404 Willow Fork Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| and allow the property to remain in the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| We are representing the seller of this property and are making this request on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| For any questions, please contact Larry Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| The e-mail is from Laura Bailey, the broker of that real estate firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| So initially they called me on it on my cell phone, and I asked them to send that to me in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| So based on direction from the law department, I would say that that written notification would constitute grounds to withdraw this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7914)|
| 2:12:03| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| All right, we have a motion to withdraw by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| Is that acceptable to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| That's what I've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| I'm all for this if this is what the owner wants, but the owner is not the applicant in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| I'm wondering if we can do that without the applicant telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| That's my concern, and that's why I was asking the law department for a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| Let me change my motion to postpone this item until next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| and let the MPC confirm with the owner of the property or the agent that they are willing to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7965)|
| 2:12:53| So that way it's not gone if the owner doesn't want it gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| All right, so I can forward you the email that I received from the real estate broker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| and if you all could please make sure you get some sort of formal notification from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| Could I have a clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| You've got your line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| It's not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| It's the applicant that we need verification from, the person that paid the fees and applied for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Is that Smithville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| Smithville, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| And I'm fine with it being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| I just want to make sure we do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| I'd like to change my motion to postpone it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| If the applicant wants to withdraw it, they can in the process before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| That's restating my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| So Commissioner Anders has restated his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| The second was by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| Both in a good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Now we can have additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| I see Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Follow up afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| You can give me a point of privilege afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| Take the vote first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| We'll go ahead and take the vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Commissioner Bussler, you had a second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| I was wondering because the Daley Company is a representative for Smithville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| They were in here brokering the sale between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| We're going to go back and get a notification from Smithville that they want to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8050)|
| 2:14:20| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| I'm going to direct that question to the law director to make sure we do this properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8062)|
| 2:14:34| In one sense, it's the applicant who has control of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| But if we have a notification from the owner of the property that the owner doesn't desire the property to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8078)|
| 2:14:50| the applicant only has authority to rezone the property on behalf of the owner anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| If we postpone this a month, we can get a certification from both of them and cover all the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8096)|
| 2:15:06| But to be honest with you, I don't see an issue with the current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| But out of an abundance of caution, let's just get a letter from the owner and the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8111)|
| 2:15:21| Okay. I'm going to look to Commissioner Anders to see if you'd like to amend that motion to say that we need to get notification from both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8121)|
| 2:15:28| I'm postponing it to allow for notification to be made properly from the applicant and or owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| Because if we withdraw it, they lose all their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| So let's just, like Daniel said, use caution and set it aside for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| And if they withdraw it, they withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| If I may, I would add that if there is some sort of fraud being perpetrated on the commission by this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8145)|
| 2:15:51| which I have no indication that that's the case, that would be grounds for placing the thing back on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| notwithstanding any withdrawal or action that the commission takes today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| So there's more than one way to skin a cat, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| The only reason I got a call from Larry Bailey, Lawrence's husband, said the owner from South Carolina told him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| they said they don't want this to go through because the applicant, Smithville, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8176)|
| 2:16:26| they decided that they didn't want the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| That was why it was postponed to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| And so he was representing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| So that's why I had him call you or call the commission office to do what they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| So, anyway, it's up to the commission what you decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| But I know both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| I'm going to go ahead and call on Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| Is Josh Sanderson, the representative from Smithville that's on the application, is he here by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| Okay, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Yeah, to me, if we've got two verifications, one from notifying the chairman of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| and one from the commissioner in that district, I think we should just go ahead and vote to withdraw it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| And if the law department's happy with that, why don't we just go ahead and not continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8241)|
| 2:17:32| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| I don't think we ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| We are not the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Smithville Homes is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| And they haven't had any, they haven't said anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| So, to me, before this body is an application from Smithville Homes, and we don't have any notification for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8262)|
| 2:17:48| So I think the proper way to do it is to postpone it and let them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| That gets it off of our plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| They can work it out with MPC, withdraw it, change their mind, do whatever they want with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| And then we haven't taken action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| Because if we withdraw it, then we're withdrawing it on behalf of an applicant who's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| And I wouldn't think that we would want to be comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| So it would seem best to postpone it and let them work it out so we're not making decisions for people who are not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| Now, Commissioner Daly, I know you want to discuss this after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| Or would you like to weigh in right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| Well, I'll go ahead and weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| A lot of times we hear bad things about developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| But I did, I thought Josh would be here, Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| I did make a request for a couple of dirty lots that Smithville had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| And they went out and cleaned it up real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| So I am proud to say that, you know, I brag on a developer when they do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| And I want to brag on Smithville for doing that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| Josh, if you're watching, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| So back to the original motion, which was to defer this for a month, made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8326)|
| 2:18:54| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8334)|

| 2:25:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| The Planning Commission is recommending that Knox County Commission adopt Resolution 9-A-18-CP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8714)|
| 2:25:22| adopting the 2018 Knoxville-Knox County major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| and recommending the Knox County Commission adopt the 2018 major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8726)|
| 2:25:32| And this was approved on consent 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| Now I'm going to look back at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| You are the applicant and you are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| So do I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| I have a motion to approve from Commissioner Anders and a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| I see Commissioner Skinmaker has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| I have a quick question for Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8755)|
| 2:26:04| Is the changes on the Campbell Station Road, North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| just to make it universal to 88 feet where it was 100 feet and then some portion 70 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8768)|
| 2:26:15| Is that just to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| We just like to have consistency among those routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| So that was the intention as far as my knowledge of it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| And it goes all the way up to Hardin Valley Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| And on Watt Road, does the 112 feet start at the Farragut town limits and go north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8788)|
| 2:26:37| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| I would have to look at the proposal itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| Because it went from 100 to 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| That's kind of an unusual number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| I was curious why that went that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| And is that the same standard that the town of Farragut has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| Typically, if you want to have a shared or multi-use path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| you really need that extra width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| A 100-foot right-of-way is more for a four-lane or five-lane with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| If you do want to add greenways or things like that that the town of Farragut may be preferable to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| you would need that extra width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| But we can check that and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| I'm just not familiar with that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| How much collaboration takes place between Engineering Public Works and MPC in developing this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8840)|
| 2:27:28| Quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| So our engineer works very closely with both city staff and county staff to develop this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8849)|
| 2:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| Your light's still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Director Snowden, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| In a growing county, I've seen almost every road on your list is increased with a few exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8869)|
| 2:27:56| It looks like Danny Road and Rifle Range that gets reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| Could you just quickly explain why in our growing county a road would be reduced in size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8882)|
| 2:28:08| I don't have it in front of me, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| Do you care to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| Was it reduced from like a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| 112 to 88 on Danny Road and Danny School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| And then it looks like Rifle Range Road went from 112 to 88 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| At one point in time, there was the proposal on the board to actually widen Danny Road, Danny School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8902)|
| 2:28:30| and Fountain City to get another path over to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8910)|
| 2:28:35| That idea has kind of got off favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| Now we've pursued more of the widening along East Emory Road and that five-lane corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8918)|
| 2:28:46| So it's just an adjustment of sort of where you thought once where to go and where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| Yeah, the topography of that particular alignment across Danny Road would be very problematic and very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8933)|
| 2:28:59| So now that the state has Emory Road widened to five lanes, I think the need for that is diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| And we could still construct a nice three-lane facility within an 88-foot wide wide array.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8951)|

| 2:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| That concludes the zoning part of our zoning agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| We do not have anything up for a zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| We now have Section C, Item No. 51, which is under Amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| This is an item on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| It's Ordinance O-18-10-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| It's amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning, Article 4, Sections 4.93 and 4.106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=8993)|

| 2:30:16| and 5.61, I Industrial Zone, regarding standards for indoor self-service storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9016)|
| 2:30:24| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9024)|
| 2:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| Commissioner Bessler, would you like to have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| I want to make a motion that weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| I don't know if we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Well, I'm wondering, on a first reading on an ordinance, we probably need to have not only a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| but we'd have to have a roll call vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| But what I was wanting to do is I want to thank you for working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| We had a problem where we didn't have any way to have this kind of trend that is happening for indoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9056)|
| 2:31:05| And just a little background on that, can you just say a little bit about changing the size of the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9065)|
| 2:31:14| and how this will look in some of these areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9074)|
| 2:31:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| Yes, we undertook this at the request of a couple of the members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| And the intent was to, first and foremost, address the minimum lot size requirements for these facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9088)|
| 2:31:36| and also develop a few standards that would go along with, of course, the minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9096)|
| 2:31:44| and also standards for buffering from residential zones specifically that might include street trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| And if you'll notice in the ordinance itself, under Section 4.93.02F, G, H, and I cover specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9111)|
| 2:32:04| what we would call design standards, you know, the location of the storage buildings, the type of lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9124)|
| 2:32:12| how they might be structured if they're adjacent to residential zone properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9132)|
| 2:32:17| and the use of chain, when it might be appropriate to use chain link and barbed razor wire fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9137)|
| 2:32:25| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| Yes, it was the barbed wire, razor wire in some of these that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| I was wondering why that was put in there on this kind of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| We see it as a common, it's commonly used in particular chain link fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9157)|
| 2:32:44| We're not saying that it's not an appropriate use, but it should be buffered in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| if it's adjacent to residentially zoned properties, as long as it has some type of green buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9168)|
| 2:32:56| Okay, I was just wondering why, never mind, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| Okay, for this, this is an ordinance, and on ordinances we do require a roll call vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| even though it's on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| So what I'd like, I'll entertain a, is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| It's approved on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| Yeah, motion to approve on first reading was made by Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| and the second was heard Commissioner Anders first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| So I'm going to look to the clerk's office to begin us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| We are beginning with Commissioner Gill on a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| I'll turn that over to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181022?start=9208)|
