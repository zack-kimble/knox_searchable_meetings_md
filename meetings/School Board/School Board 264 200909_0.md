| 0:02:56| and I would like to introduce Dr. Rodney Russell, who is the Chief of Professional Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| and Dr. Russell will introduce Collaborative Conferencing Team, and so I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| We, again, want to thank you all for the opportunity to work as a collaborative team over the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=191)|
| 0:03:20| and, again, thank you all for approving the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| Many issues that we take up come at your all's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| We also have issues that come up that teachers bring to the collaborative team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=209)|
| 0:03:38| and that is exactly what formed this year, was a collaborative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| We really looked for opportunities to have a win-win situation, what was best for children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=224)|
| 0:03:54| and we had certain guidelines that everything that we, every decision that we made, had to meet certain requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=234)|
| 0:04:04| Was it financially feasible? Was it best for students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Was it something that was going to help move our district to being closer to being the best in the southeast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| And so those kinds of decisions were important for us as we made them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce our collaborative team that participated over the past three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| in developing the MOU you all just approved last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| And, of course, our first team member is Mr. Bob Thomas, the superintendent, serves on this team as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=273)|
| 0:04:42| Scott Bolton is a part of our team, and if you all will just stand when I call you off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| for the principles that we had on our team this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| First is Brad Corum from Carnes High School, and I'm not sure if Jessica Holman, is Jessica maybe here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=296)|
| 0:05:06| Jessica Holman from Green Magnet is also part of our team, and then Cindy White from Gibbs Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| and that is our principal administrative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| The rest of our central office team is Renee Kelly, chief of staff, Beth Lackey, one of our supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=317)|
| 0:05:27| Ron McPherson, John Ryswick, and that is the administrative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| And I'm going to ask if, oh, I'm sorry, Ron Seaby as well? Did I leave anybody else off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=335)|
| 0:05:46| And Tanya is going to come and speak as well, and she's going to introduce the teachers that have served on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=346)|
| 0:05:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| So, again, I'm going to reiterate what Dr. Russell just stated in him being a, he didn't introduce himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| because he is an awesome facilitator that represents you very well in making sure that we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| Again, I can't reiterate enough about how much we appreciate being on this collaborative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| But part of our collaborative team includes Miss Paula Hancock from Carnes Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| She is the co-facilitator for the professional educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| Master, I always call him Master, or Sir Chuck O'Donnell, he is ROTC at Carnes High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| He cannot be with us today as he is fulfilling an obligation that you all well know too well that after school he must do that with ROTC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=396)|

| 0:07:38| I also want to take this time to recognize a retiree that served on this committee since its inception before 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| She couldn't be with us today because I bet you her passport is on fire somewhere in retirement land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| And that is Miss Robin Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| She served before 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=474)|

| 0:08:03| And she served from Grisham Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| And then myself, Tanya Coates, I serve as long as the superintendent shows and serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| I serve as well as the president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| That has been the only sole proprietor that has served at the table to represent all the professional educators of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| And again, we can't thank you enough for allowing us this opportunity to not only work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| to make sure that the educators in Knox County get the needed necessities to include our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=510)|
| 0:08:38| We have had a challenge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| But these last three contracts have proven that our collaboration, we have moved from being 37th and then moving to being number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=520)|
| 0:08:50| First it was 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Now we're number 3 when it comes to salaries with our like-minded constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| And so we want to continue those efforts when we talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| And I know COVID has, but we are agreeing, this team is agreeing that we will sit at the table with the management team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=541)|
| 0:09:09| We haven't beat anyone up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=549)|

| 0:09:23| And again, we can't say thank you enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=563)|

| 0:13:03| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| If I could, I'd like to ask Ms. Harrington to come down and talk a little bit about what this will be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| I know there have been a lot of questions in the community about how this will benefit students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| And knowing that it does, I'd like her to address that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Ms. Harrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| So this is a contract for a replacement printer that is used by the district and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| Actually, I would say it's a real kind of hidden gem in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| It's used by all the departments and all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| And, I mean, they print everything from instructional materials for schools, business cards, forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=817)|
| 0:13:49| They were invaluable during our closure in printing the KC at Home materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| We would not have been able to provide those to our families without the printer that has now died and that we need to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=836)|
| 0:14:07| For schools, they print everything from brochures and I think you mentioned like chorus pamphlets for concerts, additional instructional material, signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=847)|
| 0:14:25| It is at a cost that they can really save dollars if they were to go elsewhere than outside the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=865)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| I think that will help our families understand that cost a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| And I believe I read it prints well over 100 per minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| I think it was 157 per minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| So that's a speed you can't get with a regular printer and in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| That would take a lot of printers and a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| And I know and I appreciate all the patience of our departments and our schools now because we are down that printer and we are experiencing a little bit of a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=900)|
| 0:15:12| But in our opinion, the cost, it will over time really quickly save money for the district and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=912)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=922)|

| 0:16:42| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| And we move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1005)|

| 0:16:51| Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| And if you'll just state your name and county of residence, and then you will have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Mike Arms, 201 Ivy Gate Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37933,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| which means I got to vote for the chairlady this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| I'm here to talk about the Charter Review Committee and one amendment that's on the Charter Review that you'll be allowed to vote on November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| And I have a little handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| And I think this is a great opportunity for the school board, the school system, anyone associated with the school system, parents, teachers, to give the school board more autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1046)|
| 0:17:41| I can't imagine asking for legal advice on a property settlement and someone else says, well, I'm going to appoint your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1061)|
| 0:17:51| Or better yet, being in a lawsuit with another body and find out that you both have the same attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| That actually happened 16 years ago when the school board was suing the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| So the Charter Review Committee voted 15 to 9, two times, to add this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| And it allows actually three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| The county mayor appoints his or her own attorney, and it's got to be approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| If the county mayor wants to fire that attorney, the dismissal has to be approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| The county commission gets appointments on attorney, and the school board gets appointments on attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| And this happens frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| On this handout, I pulled an ad that was actually in the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| I've talked to people in Monroe County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| They had a lady, a school attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| She did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Her husband passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I've served long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| So what they're doing right now, they're considering three resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| and one of them will be the school board's attorney that's completely autonomous and completely independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| Now, you'll hear a lot of reasons where people say, oh, we should keep our law director as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Well, 90 counties in this state do not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| And I'm a believer that your three bodies that govern our county, school board, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| and our county mayor should all have their independent attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| That gives you a lot of autonomy, and you pay those people by the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| So if you look at budgets, I'm going to add in a second sheet where you see the 12 counties surrounding us have a total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1167)|
| 0:19:36| law budget of less than $2 million, Knox County's is $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| You look at Hamilton County, which is almost our size, I took that right out of their budget book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| And I also took the county attorney's scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| So Hamilton County pays about $1.1 million for its legal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| What happens, and I've been involved in politics too long, but a law director has to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| So the last nine months, a law director has been putting out signs, going to public club meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| raising money from architects and vendors who want to do business with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| So you could imagine what your school superintendent had to do if he still had to be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| what Alan Morgan had to do when he was school superintendent or director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| He had to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| It's a distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| And if you're doing a good job as the county attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| there's no reason why the county mayor of a school board should not pick you just the way they picked Alan Morgan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| to stay on as the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| I sort of want to close by one other argument we heard often was that the law director is the people's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1242)|
| 0:20:52| I can tell you that in, what year was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| 14 years ago in 1994, the citizens of Knox County overwhelmingly voted for term limits for the constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| Law directors sat there for 13 years, never defending the people's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| And it finally took a Supreme Court of Tennessee to rule that term limits are in fact in place because the people said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| So I think this is a great opportunity for you to vote yes on Amendment 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| and going forward having your own legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| By the way, one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| The Charter Review Committee is selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| It's 27 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| The mayor picks nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| The county commission serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| That's nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| The county commission picks nine for a total of 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| They meet once every eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and they can review anything the charter has to offer and then present those amendments to the people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| You got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I told Mike on the elevator he would be opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| Well, we don't do responses during public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| I was going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Sorry, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thanks again for the job you're doing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Anika Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1339)|
| 0:22:36| If you'll just state your name and county of residence, and then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| My name is Anika Jenkins, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| And so what I wanted to talk today about is keeping the kids in school and not closing for virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| I have a kindergartner that just started at Farragut Primary, and I have a seventh grader that's at Farragut Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| And I'm very concerned if it goes to a virtual learning, how is my kindergartner going to learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| How is she going to be assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| How is my seventh grader going to be assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| And what is the expectation in terms of making sure that they're going to hit all of the educational milestones that they should hit in order to then go to first grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1394)|
| 0:23:24| and then also in order to go into eighth grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| I'm also concerned because the majority of parents have actually wanted in-person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1407)|
| 0:23:36| and you can see that by the numbers, by the amount of students that are actually there in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| And I understand that some of the decisions are absolutely being driven by the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| I hope that the school board is pushing back on them, and I hope that you're pushing back to find out why they're advising some of the things that they're advising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| In terms of when the numbers are released every day, I've been watching them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| The numbers don't justify it being closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| So when you look at statistically and you look at the percentages, the kids need to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| I also work in human resources for a small company here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| and I've had a couple of employees that have come to me and said, if it goes virtual, I'm going to have to quit my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| I don't know what I'm going to do because then I'm going to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I'm not going to qualify for unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| And so the burden that it's putting on parents on how are they going to support their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| My husband and I are in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| We're thinking, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| How do we split this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| How do we work from home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| How do we make sure that we are supplementing our kids' education and making sure that they're going to get the support that they need at home and at school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1478)|
| 0:24:46| We have in our neighborhood, one of my son's friends is a ninth grader at Farragut High School, and he chose in virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| And he has told my son, and he has told us as well, that he has three Zoom classes a week, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| He doesn't have any other class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| He is incredibly lonely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| It's been very difficult for him because a lot of the expectation is on him to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| And let me make it very clear that I know that this is not the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| The teachers have been unbelievably supportive of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| When I have sent in questions or concerns to them, they're very responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| So I completely understand that this is not up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| But I'm also just concerned of what is going to happen in terms of educational quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| and how are my kids going to make sure that they are prepared for first grade, that they are prepared for eighth grade when they go forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1536)|
| 0:25:45| And I'm also just concerned as an employer as well as a parent, what does that mean financially for our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1545)|
| 0:25:54| The last thing I want to talk about is I have had difficulty getting in touch with the principals at Farragut Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1554)|
| 0:26:03| and they have been completely unresponsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Susan Horn has been great and has been very responsive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| And I just want the school district to know that it is incredibly frustrating as a parent when you try to reach out and you try to get answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| And I understand that they're busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| And then I got an email back from Weston Edmonds that just said, I'm sorry you feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| So it is incredibly, incredibly disappointing and disheartening when I'm sending our kids to public school and we have expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1588)|
| 0:26:38| And I understand the teachers and the administrators have a lot on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| But I also want the school district to understand what's on parents and what's the expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| When we get emails on a Friday night that say, please be patient with us from the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| that is really difficult because all weekend long it is frustrating to think what's happening Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| If there would be more information, like when the news came out about the substitute teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| if you would give or the superintendent would give that information to parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| it would quell so many fears because then we would understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| And so when we just get an email asking for patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| it's really frustrating when the parents don't get that in return from the principals of the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| The principal, Gina Bird, of Farragut Primary School, has been amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Every email I send, she has responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| So again, I know my time is up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| But please, please, please do everything you can to keep our kids in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you, Ms. Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1664)|
| 0:28:02| If you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| You have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| My name is Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| I am also speaking about the possibility of transition to virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| Ms. President and other board members, I know Mr. Superintendent is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| I am not a skilled speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| That's why I have a prepared statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| But I am compelled to speak with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| First, thank you for all of your hard work in trying to keep our kids in school in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| As a mother of two Knox County students and a practicing PA in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| I have spoken with numerous parents, teachers, and colleagues who share my views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| We have and are currently punishing the least vulnerable and least at risk from COVID-19, our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| Our children are suffering dire consequences, but not from the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| The school closure earlier this year, the delayed reopening this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| the restrictions we are placing on them, including the masks they are required to wear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| and quarantines due to simply being around someone who tests positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| All of these things are having severe consequences with which we will likely be dealing for many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| Actions do have consequences, and I will concede that in February and March we were unsure how to handle the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| because there was such limited information aside from knowing that this was a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Today we have a plethora of information with more coming to light every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| COVID-19 spares at least 997 out of 1,000 people who are infected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| hits children mildest of any age group, not to mention in kids it is much less severe than the seasonal flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| and spread stops at about 20% of the population when we reach herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| So I'm sure you all know we get vaccinations so we can get to herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| If we don't have a vaccination, people need to be exposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| and our children are the healthy young ones who can get us to that herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| We do want to protect the elderly and immunocompromised populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| The best shield we have are these healthy young people who do not get severe disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| and reach the herd immunity to help shield the vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| For example, infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at Oxford, Sunitra Gupta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| recommends exposure of the general populace to the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| British statistician Sir David Eaglehalter from Cambridge states it is staggeringly low risk for the young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| Dr. John Ioannidis, professor of medicine, epidemiology, and population of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| states at Stanford that risk to those below retirement age is less serious than driving to work or school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| There should be no need for asymptomatic children or teachers to be quarantined for extended periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| If they are sick, then they should stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1856)|

| 0:31:03| rather than feelings of safety as a secondary goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Some of the most serious damage done to our children from school not being open for in-person learning in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| or for those in primary and elementary schools, lack of socialization and of learning fundamentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| and not being able to move on because they don't have the basics to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| increased rates of depression, child abuse, lack of nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| I had a patient today who said her first grader is overwhelmed with anxiety due to all of these restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| In high school specifically, there has been a greater death from suicides and drug overdoses than from COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| Think of all the experiences that have been missed, prom, their exercise in spring sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| opportunities to take college entrance exams, to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| We have come to the masks. Increasing information is coming to light on the detrimental effects on health and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| Kids are getting bacterial lung infections from wearing these masks and breathing in all these bacteria all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| staph infections of the skin covering where the mask has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| tooth decay due to lack of fresh oxygen in the mouth, headache from re-breathing CO2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| and decreased ability to concentrate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| In those less than or equal to six years old, pediatricians state lasting effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| which stunt children's development due to coverage of one's countenance and increased anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| So please consider that many of the parents and medical professionals in Knox County are of this same opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| We just work and lead busy lives and have difficulty making our voices heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| and getting to these meetings to be able to share our thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| We all want the best for our kids. I know the teachers want the best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| I know you do as well. Please do push back on the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Current data today for ages 0 to 17 as of, well, I don't know, is this the 9th, 9-9-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| total cases in that age group 791, hospitalized 9, which is a hospitalization rate of 1.14 and 0 deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| So the Academy of Pediatricians believes children should be in school with no restrictions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Tanya Coates, Knox County. Thank you for the opportunity again to speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| However, today you may have noticed that there was a motorcade for some cool cats around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| So it's called Community and Teachers of Wanting Safe Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| I did hear what was going on, but let me tell you a little bit why they had the march for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| So even though we are in school in person, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| so most of the people that are part of this community group actually cannot be out in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| So I got someone to actually read these for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| And when I'm talking about this, that knowing that Knox County Education Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| we also believe that, you know, as educators, that we should have these in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| When we're thinking about why did they march today, marching mean in a motorcade march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Why did they go around and drive around and just trying to familiarize people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| One, they want to make sure that Knox County Schools has established is clear, defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| quantifiable data driven matrix to safe openings in school and closing schools to make sure they're clear and consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2064)|
| 0:34:34| Knox County communication about covid cases and when schools go on and offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| Three, make sure there's safe ventilation in classrooms for equitable support for parents and guardians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| When school goes online, five in school and virtual release of teacher liability in person and virtual release of teachers that teach online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2088)|
| 0:35:00| that this teacher liability, six, the right for teachers and staff to speak out without retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| And then seven and eight have to deal with our governor that you all can help us with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| that our governor must increase the funding for public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| We are insufficient of funding and it continues to be a criteria that we think about in regards to covid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| And the number eight governor must cancel all state testing and teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| Now, when you hear those criteria, I know you're saying to yourself that we've done most of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| You have done that. When you think about the dashboard that you have actually put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| you went from just naming what's going on in schools to you now actually quantified it all the way down to naming those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| When you talk about clear and consistent, we talk about clear and consistent communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| Sometimes we do have those loopholes, but I know that the superintendent does everything to make sure that it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| However, as you heard earlier, sometimes the health department doesn't actually give us the right data either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| And so parents in the community are asking for that. But safe demolition of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| This is going to take a governmental change. Right. When you think about Senator Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| Alexander talked about this, our brick and mortar buildings are so outdated that it's you can't even afford to replace some of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| When you're thinking about Adrian Burnett that you're just getting to or Lonsdale that we're just getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| This is money that's out of our pockets and we know that you're going to need assistance, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| So the community is asking for you to continue to partner with them and make sure that students and staff have a safe and equitable learning environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| And it won't get any better until we continue to educate the community, because sometimes they get this misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| And remember, they're there when they assume things are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| Assumptions become reality. And we don't want the reality of any of our kids being sick or any other people being put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| Put in the hospital or at the least bit of passing away. So we thank you for listening to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| We will forward you all those in regards to community of what it's outlined in three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| But that is the reason why they had the march today to make sure the community understands that this is a challenge not only for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| but it's a challenge for the community and families across Knox County. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you, Miss Coates. Amber Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2252)|
| 0:37:42| Please just state your name and county of residence. Yes, my name is Amber Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I live in Knox County. I earlier passed out. You guys have a little bit of my PowerPoint that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| Just kind of keep me on task here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| So I would like to talk about why the opportunity for our students to be in school is essential for their education and social needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| I am here just like I was mentioned previously. A lot of working parents, medical professionals, essential personnel have a hard time reaching out and voicing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2282)|
| 0:38:12| Just simply because of time constraints. We're working. We're working long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| We have health care needs, child care needs that we're trying to keep up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| So I'm here to speak for the working parents, single moms, women, essential workers and health care workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| I propose that teachers and students be deemed essential. We've heard that word before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| We've used it a lot since covid. Certainly there are different ways to think about essential employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| I'm a health care professional. We have been working the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| There's not been a delay in grocery stores. You know, a lot of other things that have been deemed essential, which covers more than health care, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| So I'm proposing now teachers and children and their education is to be deemed essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| This would allow them to continue in school as long as risk is low and safety guidelines are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| Now, this in no way is meant to take away virtual learning options for the people who feel like that is important for their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| their medical needs, because certainly there is a place for that in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Also, it was decided to implement wearing masks and our social distancing in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| My daughter is also a kindergartner. One reason I decided to send her to public versus private school is simply because I felt like Knox County had a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2359)|
| 0:39:29| They were making smart moves, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| However, if a teacher and child is doing these things that have deemed been deemed protective, they should be considered low risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| If another teacher child has a positive covid-19 test, just as we as essential employees are deemed as a low risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| If that happens, that should allow them to continue teaching or learning in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| If that's the option that was chosen for that family while being monitored daily as recommended and as we're already doing in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| Without symptoms, they are considered low risk and their jobs as teachers and staff or education for the students should take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2403)|
| 0:40:13| The CDC already has guidelines set aside to follow if essential personnel are exposed to covid-19 so that they can continue with their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| I've outlined that for you. You can see Knox County. Great news. We're already doing the majority of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| Prescreening, regular monitoring for symptoms, wear a mask, social distance, disinfect and clean work spaces, spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| Just as we do every day going into our jobs as essential employees, health care providers, whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| There are certain things that we're doing asked to do that help us know that we're low risk and we are not in any place that we are going to expose other people that can be done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2443)|
| 0:40:55| And like I said, you're already doing most of those. You guys have already set that aside and outlined it in your opening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| I should say I was I'm from Florida. Originally, my parents both retired in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| They are actually taught for a few years. I have great respect for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| However, as we all know, there's a difference between parents and people who do other jobs and teachers. Teachers have special callings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| They're special people. They are qualified. They have actual training, teaching degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2479)|
| 0:41:27| I am not made to teach my kindergartner. I don't have time. I have other important functions in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| I don't have family here. We moved to Knoxville for job opportunities. There is no one in my family that can take care of my kids for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| I would have to try to work and teach my kids. There is a kindergarten teacher who is super awesome that is more qualified to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| There's also time set aside for school in school. In my home, there's no time set aside for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| That's why they go to school every day. Many parents are struggling to keep up with virtual learning while working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| We've all seen the posts on Facebook that basically say, look, here's my kid trying to do something with them while I'm working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| Also, as already mentioned, the social negative behaviors that are coming out of this. I'm not going to mention that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| Parents are running out of PTO. In the beginning, there was a lot of federal assistance for this. We're out of PTO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| If our students are sent home, I will not get paid. Child care is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| There's not enough daycares and child cares that can cover all of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| There's a summary page. I'm going to run out of time. But basically, if we deem our kids and teachers essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| we will not have to worry about running out of substitutes as quickly because our teachers will be teaching in school and they are the most qualified people to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2559)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you. Thank you, Miss Burns. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| And we are adjourned. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200909?start=2578)|
