| 0:27:37| years since I have been proud to introduce our country's flag. I ask that you please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| stand and give proper courtesy to our country's flag and join in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| Mr. Chair. Okay, we will start with setting the agenda and amendments to the agenda. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| there any items to be withdrawn? Seeing none, are there any items to be deferred? I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1692)|
| 0:28:35| two items that are to be deferred, one item to be deferred. It's from the schools on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1715)|

| 0:29:40| I see on our printed agenda we have before us on page 11, R-802, resolution 803 and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| discussion items, number 74 by Commissioner Wright and number 75 by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| Commissioner Daly? Yes, I'd like to add a discussion item next week with schools on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| the status of Pawn Gap Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1802)|
| 0:30:11| Okay, and we will start with everything on consent and I would like to have pulled off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| resolution 802, 803, all three of the second reading ordinances. 101, 102, and 103 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| the ordinances. Is there any other items that the Commissioners wish to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1827)|
| 0:30:58| Yes, it's item number 58 related to the FEMA grant. I'd like to discuss that tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| then learn a little bit and then probably put it on consent for next week. Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1864)|
| 0:31:21| I think it would also be appropriate to discuss item number 65 related to securing the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| for the Diversion Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1887)|
| 0:31:37| Okay, do I have a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1897)|

| 0:31:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I need a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1912)|

| 0:32:22| The first item is listed on page 10. It's item number 58, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1942)|
| 0:32:52| Resolution 501 is to approve the grantee agreement articles and obligating document for the acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| of an award in the amount of $536,250 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1978)|

| 0:33:10| attacks. No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Would you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| It's Jenny Holden, 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| The reason why I wanted to bring this up is, number one, I think it's a great thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| our community to have received this money to increase our preparedness in the hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| unlikely event of a terrorist attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| And I guess one thing I was curious, when I looked at the documents on it, I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| that Knox County was the only grantee in the state of Tennessee to receive these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| Can you tell me a little, which is once again a good thing, can you tell me a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| about how we received this funding for this particular program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| We're actually extremely proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Typically, the Department of Homeland Security funds are given out based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| This was only the second time that DHS has offered a competitive grant that anyone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| the country, states, local governments could apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| We applied Knox County as the host county for District 2 Homeland Security, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| the 15 counties that surround Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| And we already have a regional approach, and that's really what they were looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| because we've been working together for 12 years now since the Homeland Security concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| They liked our proposal, and we got the call that Knox County was one of only two small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| jurisdictions in the country that received these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| If you look at the list, it's New York and L.A., and we're very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| Well, congratulations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| So a lot of it's going to help our multidisciplinary team, coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| If you could, for just another minute, elaborate on that, then I'll be happy to pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| on to our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| There's no equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| You cannot purchase equipment with this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| It's all training and exercises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| We cover all emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| It's not just law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| With this kind of event, law enforcement is obviously going to be your lead agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| But with these funds, we'll pull in all of our emergency services partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| The first piece is a gap analysis, where we go county to county and look at plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| procedures and training and see what we need to update, what kind of training we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| And then we'll follow that up with bringing in training from all over the country, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| well as exercises to exercise what we've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| And then we finish it with four conferences where we share what we've learned with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| small jurisdictions across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| I'd like to make a motion to move this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Unless there's any other commissioners that have some comments to move this to our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| Well, we've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| If it approves unanimously, then it goes to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| With a motion in front of us and a proper second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| The next item is listed on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| It's item number 64, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| It's accepting the amended certified tax rate based on the reappraisal and establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| an official tax rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2195)|
| 0:36:44| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| Director Caldwell, would you like to come down here and speak to this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2218)|
| 0:37:08| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| We noticed in our department as we were going over the resolutions from last month that the breakout between the funds of the tax rate was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2229)|
| 0:37:23| And so all this is doing is still the same appraisal rate of 212, but it's just getting the breakout between the funds correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2243)|
| 0:37:34| Anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| With a proper motion before us and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2257)|

| 0:37:51| It's approving a grant contract in the amount of $3,482,625 with the required local matching funds in the amount of $1,263,806 with the State of Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the provision of pre-arrest diversion infrastructure for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2271)|
| 0:38:14| Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I would like to make a motion that we pass this to the regular commission with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| This was the reason why this was just added to our agenda, and it is a fairly long grant to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2302)|
| 0:38:32| There's no one from Helen Ross McNabb here to answer any of the questions, and I'd like some time to look at how the lease, the service contract, and this grant match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2312)|

| 0:39:51| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| Should we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I'd like to make a substitute motion to send without recommendation. We've got to have a public hearing on it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| I'd like to make a motion that we postpone this one for 60 days because Commissioner Gill, Carringer, Schoonemaker, Busler, and I, there are still questions that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2407)|
| 0:40:18| So my alternate motion is to go 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| You can't stop it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| I don't think we had a second to yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| I don't disagree with you, but I think it would be more proper to send this without recommendation because you've got a pending public hearing and then deal with it on Monday as a delay or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2431)|
| 0:40:40| That's fine. I plan on recommending all three ordinances be postponed, so I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2440)|
| 0:40:49| Is there a second on the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Yes, we need a second on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| Mr. Daly, did you want to add more? Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| No, like I say, there's questions that's got to be, I think, clarified in the writing and the words on this one and the other ones, and I would, like I say, next week I'll make a recommendation to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2461)|
| 0:41:15| Yeah, I just, I got a phone call today from somebody that, Farmers and the Cattlemen's Association, that were quite concerned about this, and so they're going to be here at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2475)|
| 0:41:26| And so as we have that conversation, I think we need to consider that and make sure you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Do you want to go ahead, Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Do you want to do it now or do you want to wait until we have a public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Wait until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I want to speak to this ordinance now, if I could, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Yes, sir, Mr. Vice Chair. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| Which, we're speaking to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| My point is that your motion to postpone, I want to speak to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2522)|
| 0:42:13| I don't think we need to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| We need to deal with it now because it does have some, let me go over this, what I have done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| First of all, we're reviewing this ordinance to have to do with rural retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| My first reviews of this concern me regarding the inclusion of agricultural, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2547)|
| 0:42:36| And I also want to thank the four commissioners that came to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| MPC, home builders, and the press that attended this meeting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| And I want to thank you all for doing that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| I've now reviewed the Tennessee state law pertaining to the definition of agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| It is a lengthy law regarding the use or ordinances being used for agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2577)|
| 0:43:12| I also spoke to Senator Frank Nicely regarding the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| As you may or may not know, Senator Nicely penned part of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| Having spoken to Senator Nicely and to representatives from the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| I have now come to the conclusion that by passing this ordinance that includes the terms related to agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| we would be breaking Tennessee state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I understand that MPC has worked hard on penning this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| I also understand that a 30-day postponement will be asked for by concerned citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2623)|
| 0:43:52| In my opinion, the only way this ordinance can pass is to remove any and all reference to agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2632)|
| 0:44:04| Mr. Law Director, I would like your opinion on what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2644)|
| 0:44:13| Well, the state statute precludes any county government from regulating agricultural farm operations or any agricultural activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2653)|
| 0:44:27| The rural retreat, if a farmer wants a rural retreat, under the current existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| they can have a rural retreat as long as it is incidental to farm operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| But the broader thing is agricultural zones, which would be a different issue altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2677)|
| 0:44:50| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| On the rural retreat that we discussed last week or the week before last, I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| 4.10402 says that MPC, with a written agreement from the adjacent partial owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| may consider reduction of less than 300 feet setbacks in the plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| I kind of like to see that wording taken out and that be either a BZA review or this commission review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| not left up to MPC review, if that's legal to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| So I think that you take someone that's in my neighborhood that's got a barn that's 198 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| and it's not meeting these regulations, I think that they need to come before this board or another board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| to ask for the variance if we can leave this section D in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| And that's why I'm saying there's still some questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| I don't think we need to be in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| I think we need to do it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| I just wanted to, there's some people in the audience that are here to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| and I just wanted to make sure that they're aware that there's a six o'clock public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| and I think it's probably a better, as this vote will probably move forward without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| and nothing really happens until next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I just wanted to let you all know that we know that there's a hearing at six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| and you will be heard during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| I just want to make sure we don't currently have a motion to postpone on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| No, the motion on the floor is to pass to the full commission, regular session, with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| A week from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, seeing no other lights, we have a motion in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2808)|

| 0:48:51| about some issues that was in this zoning here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| and I didn't know if anybody that was there wanted to speak to them now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2936)|

| 0:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| I have some questions about it, but I'll wait until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| With a proper motion before us and properly second, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=2954)|

| 0:50:20| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Mr. Chairman, there's quite a few line item transfers for next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| You guys might want to just run through and take a look at those so you're up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Item 73, spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| The Knox County Mayor's Order reappointing Joseph Longmire to the Board of Commissioners of the Northeast Knox Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3036)|
| 0:50:45| Item 74 is discussion of items to be presented at the upcoming county legislative delegation and commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| I brought that as the chair for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| If it be okay, we discuss it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| Item 75, discussion regarding purchasing versus leasing county buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| If it's all right, we'll go ahead and just discuss it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| It won't take but just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| I think the executive branch of government would like to know what the feeling is from the county commission if, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| we should be pursuing purchasing property and constructing buildings on it or, in certain cases, leasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3092)|
| 0:51:43| So we need kind of a go around the room and just say your thoughts and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| Now, I understand, obviously, for if we wanted to pursue something and say Hugh Nystrom's district on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| it would be cost prohibitive for the county to purchase land adjoining Kingston Pike as well as in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3118)|
| 0:52:06| So what I really need from you all is to say we should just have a no leasing policy or we should have a no buying policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3126)|
| 0:52:18| or what is your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Well, I think it really depends on the use of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| I mean, obviously, some things you can't lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| A jail would be one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| But I think there's opportunity for us to do leasing and I think it depends on how offices maybe need to follow growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| whether a clerk's office needs to move somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| But, I mean, I think it's smart to lease as many buildings as you can because those are staying on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| and there are commercial rates and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Some things you can't, but I think for the most part lease as much as you can and keep it on the tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| because you might turn around and need less space or outgrow that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Did you beat him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| My take is we do this on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| and I think we also need to look at it from a customer service perspective because there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| I'm thinking of things like the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| I'm thinking of things like down the road, you know, the pension office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| There's a lot of things that we want to make sure that we bring our services to make them more accessible to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| and leasing may be a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| And it could also give us a way with five-year leases or short-term leases to try something and measure it to see if it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| and if it's a service that's utilized and then it doesn't commit county capital in the event that we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| that something didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I agree with my fellow commissioners that property values may be in my area, Carter, Corrington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3235)|
| 0:54:03| that's not really developing like we say in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| So it makes more sense to us as a needed basis as to whether we lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| Like Commissioner Andrews said, at least it stays on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| We get taxes if we lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| But then it may make more common sense to purchase out in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| because by the time you lease for ten years, you may have bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| So it's just that I think it would be an as-needed basis is the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| I guess I'll weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| I agree with some things every one of you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| I think it is on a case-by-case basis, depending upon if it's an ongoing concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| if it's something that needs to be moved around with the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| depending on the price for real estate in the area we need to locate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| But it is something we need to look at, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| So I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Anybody else want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| It just makes sense to me to, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I was just going to recognize you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| It just makes sense to look at the best option available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| and to set an ironclad policy if we're not going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| doesn't make any sense at all to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| Item number 76, discussion to clarify billing for ambulance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| Vice Chair Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| As you know, I have expressed questions and concerns regarding rural metro billing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| and I'm fully aware that this has been voted on with an affirmative vote of 7-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| to extend the contract for an additional five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Due to my continued concern regarding the billing practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| I sent a letter to our law director on September 2nd regarding clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| I will now read four questions I have addressed here to the law director for response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| Before I read this letter, I want to quote information from the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| The contract has a rate schedule on it called 6.6 rates and charges proposed in contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| Rural Metro is proposing a bundle rate structure that includes all services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| and supplies in the base rate and mileage charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| All rates are inclusive with no add-ons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Please note that this contract refers to first responders, parts of the service provided by rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3405)|
| 0:56:58| Now, I want to read these questions that I proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| I strongly believe that there is an ample need to clarify following the extension of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| granted to AMR by the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| most especially, I think, for the citizens of Knox County regarding an opinion for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| regarding quantum merit theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| In your opinion, is the quantum merit theory legal and in keeping with the contract between Knox County and AMR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3446)|
| 0:57:36| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| The discussion the other night, I believe, was using quantum merit as it relates to the first responder vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| Under the 6.6 rate charge, all rates are to be inclusive within the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| and there's a table there and there's some mileage there and that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| If the contractor chooses to use others to subsidize or meet times or do whatever they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| that's between them and whoever that supplier is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| and that's expense on them within the budget of what they have agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| The issue that came up was a property owner or a renter, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| that their lease store came and called for ambulance service or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| and the property owner was charged and they charged the property owner for the first responder piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| under the theory of quantum merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| I'm trying to figure out how to put this in a very simple term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| The property owner has no benefit under a rented piece of property or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| The person that is under a 911 call, the person who has made the call is the benefactor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| The property owner has no benefit and under quantum merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| the first rule is that the person being charged must receive a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| and without that benefit being bestowed upon the landowner, quantum merit would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| There is a history behind the quantum merit theory appearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| Under the initial contract whereby rural metro was the contract holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| they followed the rate structure under 6.6 pretty much to the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| After a merger occurred, the quantum merit theory came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| after the state legislature rejected the theory that they could charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| They tried to get a statute whereby they could charge for the first responders in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| That was not passed by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| So then they fell back to the quantum merit theory by charging the landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| because that's the only person they can get a hold of because they may not know who else was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| But to answer the question succinctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| quantum merit would not apply to anyone who was not the direct beneficiary of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| It is an implied contract whereby the one that receives the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| is the one that quantum merit would fall upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| And if I own the house or the land or the property whereby that call was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| I did not benefit, therefore quantum merit would not apply to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| But it may apply to the person that actually received the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Now, the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| As you recall, my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Tim Pat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| was obstinaciously forgiven of four different bills they received under AMR's quantum merit theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3640)|
| 1:00:49| Would this not set a precedent for all similar cases to be forgiven by AMR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| Mr. Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Would this set a precedent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Well, the company set a precedent by forgiving a charge that they made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| They'd have to evaluate each bill under the same circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| and determine whether that same theory of forgiveness would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| That would be something that the contractor and the supplier would have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| and determine if the same people were charged and forgiven on this occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| for due process of all other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| you would think that they would have the same opportunity to at least express a grievance to the supplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3689)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| Clearly, the billing structure used by AMR relates to the contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| Another aspect of the contract between AMR and Knox County that concerns me is the nature of all-inclusive billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3715)|
| 1:02:05| Yet there appears to be a pattern of additional charges to what should be the sum total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3725)|
| 1:02:15| In my opinion, in your opinion, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| is this practice in keeping with the spirit of the contract with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3739)|
| 1:02:29| Mr. Commissioner, I'm not familiar with all the billings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| but the rural metro in their proposal had a bundled rate structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| that included all services and supplies and the base rate and mileage charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| And all rates are inclusive and there are no add-ons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| That's what the contract says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| So they go by the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| If it is an E911 call, at that point it is an emergency call under this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| and that bill falls under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Whatever happens after that, it doesn't matter how you interpret it on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| When you get an E911 call and it's an emergency call, it falls under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| The rate's under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| If they get a call from me, for example, as a customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| then it falls under our agreement whereby I think they can bill my insurance company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| in addition to my annual rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| So there's various ways that they can bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| but if they get an E911 call through the system and it falls under this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| then all the charges are bundled under this table and no add-ons can occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| according to our agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| And Rural Metro had always operated that way, at least in their first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| It seems to me that AAMR is utilizing the services of the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| to meet criteria for first responder, when oftentimes there is no need for the fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| I'm interested to know if your opinion is in keeping with the contract between Knox County and AAMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3844)|
| 1:04:15| The contractor can use any source, even other ambulance services if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| to meet their timeline and the benefit of the customer that is called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| But all of those services that are done through the E911, that's what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| it doesn't matter what they use or how they use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| It falls under the 6.6 rate charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| It's bundled, and their agreement with the other ambulance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| or other fire departments or using their own fire department is between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| and however they want to do it to meet their times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| The only thing that there's two advantages to sometime using your first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| whoever supplies it, they can get there faster sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| and it provides a service to the victim or to the person making the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| It can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| And it also extends the time for that transporting element of the ambulance service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| of which we are actually contracted with to arrive and provide the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| So however they want to bundle that service is entirely how they want to manage the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3920)|
| 1:05:29| But if it falls under this contract, it falls under the rates and charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| But I don't want to belabor this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| but I think you will concede I'm very passionate about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| due to the reports I have received from my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I believe that every entity doing business with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| not only a moral obligation but a legal obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| So thank you, Mr. Law Director, for your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| I felt it was a need that I had to classify or clarify these issues with my citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| and I thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| Mr. Hornish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I'm Jerry Hornish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| I'm the fire chief at Rural Metro, 160 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| I just wanted to say in clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| the particular instance that Vice Chair Busler is discussing was not a medical call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| Mr. Pat's tenant was calling for a non-emergency service that was provided by the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| does not provide non-emergency services to residents except to do medical transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4002)|
| 1:06:50| So I don't want to get into an extended legal discussion about how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| but this wasn't an instance where a 911 call was placed for a medical response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| It was a call placed by a tenant wishing another kind of non-emergency assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| So until very recently, our policy was we did not provide non-emergency services to non-subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| The reason that we changed that policy was because public safety required otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| There are now people who live independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| who can find themselves under circumstances requiring some assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| and our feeling has been that we can't in good conscience just refuse those calls as we did in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4046)|
| 1:07:35| One thing I do want to mention about the first responder program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| the reason that those paramedic engine companies are allowed under the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| is because Knox County wished to reduce its subsidy for ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| So there's no financial benefit to AMR and quite frankly no financial benefit to the fire department for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| It's simply an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| But it was a tool used a quarter century ago to reduce subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| Now the contract is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| If there's a desire for those services not to be funded through the means they are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| that's a discussion for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| But AMR accrues no benefit from the paramedic engine program, not financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| It's simply an additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| Matt, did you want to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4107)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| I certainly want us to keep in mind that we're looking at two different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| We're looking at rural metro and the ambulance side, and then there's the rural metro fire side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| I've not been made aware that the ambulance side or medical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| which is what the contract is you all just extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| there has been any other billing other than the $755 and whatever the mileage rate for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| Add-ons, and we changed this, we did want to complete, put all this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| was when they were able to charge for an IV or oxygen or a gauze pad or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| We told them we wanted everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| So I'll have to respectfully disagree about the add-ons of another entity's services that they may be providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4164)|
| 1:09:33| But I do think, you know, based on the 6.6 and everything, there aren't any other add-ons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| That $755, if you're being transported, is what they're being charged and paid, and any mileage that goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4178)|
| 1:09:57| Item number 77 is discussion of the employee policy handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Again, this item I have on the agenda is on behalf of the chair of commission to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| at some point in time over the next few months, review and determine what the employee handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| should be looking like for employees that are reporting into the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| That would be the director of commission office and the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And the committee that was appointed is still standing, and they're still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| So they'll be reporting to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Who is that committee, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| And I believe we have a deadline of November 10th, I believe, to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| When is our deadline to have either a handbook in or adopt the county's handbook by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| It's November 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| November 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| November 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| We've got to adopt it in the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| So that really only gives us a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| All right, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| As I shared at our last meeting, I've spoken with representatives in the three other major cities in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| to find out how they handle this, for lack of a better word, this HR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| And it has varied from we just use the same policies as the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| You've also got a lot of apples and oranges where you've got an organization like Shelby County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| with multiple employees and political appointees actually working in their commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| to a county more like Hamilton, which is actually fairly similar size-wise in their commission office to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| and then Davidson County, which is a lot bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| As an outcome from tonight, what I'd like to do is try to have our committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| we can schedule a time to come together and talk about all this stuff and provide an additional update for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| We probably should also get copies of the handbook from Knox County HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| and see if that could be an alternative for us to adopt the county's HR policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| I think it would be very helpful for you guys on this committee to actually invite Colonel Julian and Mark Jones to your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| There's no other business before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Coming up this Wednesday, we are headed over to Evelyn Gill's neck of the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| It's going to be the Ed and Bob night out, the 32nd edition of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| We're going to be at Jackie's Dream, 2223 McCalla Avenue from 5 to 7 this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| All commissioners, all elected officials, anybody that wants to come by and have some hot chicken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| and also talk to your commissioners and hopefully other elected officials, you're welcome to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| You've got Roy Cruz coming up Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| Is it this Thursday or next Thursday we're honoring Roy Cruz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| I forgot the date on that. It's on my calendar and I don't have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Thursday at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Thursday at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| Give me one second to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4409)|

| 1:13:35| I'll make a plug for Amber Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| School board member and I will be at G&D Deli on the 26th this month from 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| So if you're out in that area, stop in and see us and I'll take your comments or requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| And then next Friday at the Sono Taco, our longtime councilman for the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| Mr. Nick Pavlis will be having a kind of a get-together from 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| So if you all know Nick, stop by between 5 and 7 and thank him for his 16 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4445)|
| 1:14:15| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| If I could please get the other commissioners up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4466)|
| 1:14:47| I call to order this public hearing to address these three ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4487)|
| 1:15:02| First item is discussion of ordinance 0-17-8-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| which is proposing amendments to the Knox County Code Appendix A zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| Article 2, Section 2.20, Specific Terms, Article 5, Section 5.11, RA Low Density Residential Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4512)|
| 1:15:20| Section 5.12, RB General Residential Zone, Section 5.13, PR Plan Residential Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| Section 5.21, E Estate Zone, Section 5.22, A Agricultural Zone, and Section 5.36, T Transition Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4527)|
| 1:15:35| and adding a new Article 4, Section 4.104, Standards for the Use on Review Approval of Rural Retreats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| to Establish Regulations for Rural Retreat Facilities in the Agricultural, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| General Residential Estates, Transition, and Plan Residential Zoning Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4547)|
| 1:15:57| Mr. King, would you give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4561)|
| 1:16:13| I think, Mr. Chairman, it might be best to perhaps call on Representative Kennedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4573)|
| 1:16:23| the County Law Director, to discuss this before I start talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| I represent some people who are interested in the subject matter, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| I understand Mr. Bussler has a problem with passing any ordinance that affects agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4596)|
| 1:16:48| that's declared or operated as agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| I'd like to suggest that we go first to the Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4613)|
| 1:17:03| I think this certainly did not originate, this proposal did not originate with my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4623)|
| 1:17:13| but it came up and was pursued by the county and MPC as a subject matter to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4633)|
| 1:17:26| I think the Law Director and Mr. Archer, who's here from Andover and others, hear from MPC to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4646)|
| 1:17:38| As soon as I find out for sure what it is Mr. Bussler wants with respect to this legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| I'll be prepared to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4665)|
| 1:17:59| Could I defer to Mr. Archer to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| Mr. Archer, I apologize if they're talking about Tom over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| I wouldn't want Mr. Brousseau, because it would be insulting to call him by your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| You can get up and talk. I'm just giving you a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4698)|
| 1:18:29| I guess I'll just start by giving you a little background of why this was even brought up in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| Can I get your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I'm sorry, Mike Brousseau with MPC Staff, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| We got a lot of calls at the Development Services Desk over these last five years or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| from people that are wanting to use their rural properties for events like weddings, birthday parties, pony parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4728)|
| 1:18:59| any kinds of things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| Most of these areas are out in very rural areas where rezoning them to OB or commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4744)|
| 1:19:12| or something that would allow that use is going to be nearly impossible to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| So really they were kind of stuck with no options to even allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| I guess the one thing I want to make clear is this is not intended to be regulatory at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| In fact, it's something that we're putting out there as an option for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| who would like to legally establish those kinds of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| I guess in regard to the state law, we are certainly aware that there is state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4777)|
| 1:19:46| that exempts certain uses that are zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| The issue is it's fairly unclear what exactly is all exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| and we felt it's not MPC's place to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| If someone has a use that they feel is allowed by the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4799)|
| 1:20:07| MPC's not going to step in and say, no, no, no, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| And we've noted that in this proposal, saying that certain agricultural uses are permissible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4812)|
| 1:20:20| by Tennessee state law, Right to Farm Act and other regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| and these uses, if permissible and deemed in compliance with state regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| are exempt from review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| But we had to base it off what the County Code Administration Office told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| which was that event facilities cannot be permitted unless they are properly zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| And like I said, therein lies the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| is that pick any property that's out in a rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| and come in and ask for commercial or office zoning on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| the chances of that happening are pretty slim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| And mainly it's because of all the other uses that could be allowed in that zone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| So we felt that these uses, in certain situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| and if they can be reviewed at a public meeting and reviewed by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| and set some regulations along with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| we feel it's giving folks an opportunity to set up one of these type of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| And if done right, we feel, under the regulations that we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| we feel that it should be a benefit to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| to allow folks to make additional use from their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| Again, if things are exempt by state law and they want to pursue that, that's their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| But we were going on based on what the Codes Administration Department told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| which was that rezoning was the only way that these things could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| Their opinion was you cannot have an event facility in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Now, the state law may contradict that, but I don't really know that definite answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| It came about, again, I said we got all these phone calls for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| and I happened to be at a state planning conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| and two counties over in Middle Tennessee, Rutherford and Williamson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| had both had similar ordinance to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| similar parts in their ordinance that allow these kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| and it sounded really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Essentially, it just was me coming back from this conference and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| hey, Mr. Director, is this something we'd like to pursue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| and gave him a little background on the amount of phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| and we decided to just put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| So I guess if there's any questions specifically related to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| I'll just leave it at that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| But that was the idea behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| I would like to see if there's anybody else in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| that wants to give public input on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| before we start to discuss this amongst ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| so that we can get an understanding of what their questions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| Would you please come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| My name is Sammy Parker, 10255 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| Let me say up front, I am a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I also have been a member of the American Meditation Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| for almost 18 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| I've been talking with Mike since February about retreat centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| and what we should do, what we should implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| in order to establish a retreat center here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| And I have to tell you, we have viewed 37 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| here in Knox County since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| And we're wanting to put an offer on something, but we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| because we don't know what to do because there is no zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| And when you put an offer on a $2 million property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| and you say, oh, but we can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| until NBC tells us what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| do you think they're really going to even look at that offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| So Mark sent me these regulations for retreat centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| and I've looked over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| And I have questions, but I guess the main thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| would it be different, how would it impact a 501c3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| Is there a difference between that and just someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| who's wanting to open a retreat center to make money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| That's not what American Meditation Society is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| So would there be a difference with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| And overlooking all of this, we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| how many people can spend the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| according to how many acres there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| How long has it been since you all lived at property in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| that had something that would hold 25 to 40 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| and had 50 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Have you looked at that lately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| So what I'm saying to you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| we're really trying to stay in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| We want to stay in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| And I'm not talking about an event center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| because in talking to Mike, what he said was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| the difference between a retreat center and an event center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| is that we would actually have people coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| three or four times a year to a retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| and maybe spending a week learning how to meditate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| learning how to let go of stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| That's what meditation is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| And just let me say that I've been teaching meditation for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| It's changed my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| and I know that I have changed other people's lives through meditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| I have helped people get off all kinds of meds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| I've helped people stay in recovery through meditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| So it's something near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| I'm not just a realtor up here wanting to make a deal, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Some of the questions that I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| if an event center, which we have all over Knoxville now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| has no time frame for shutting down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| why should we have to roll in the sidewalks at 9 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| if this is what passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| In other words, we have to be quiet after 9 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| How quiet is quiet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| And also the other thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| there's one section in there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| certain agriculture uses are permissible by Tennessee state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| under the Right to Farm Act and other regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| These uses are permissible in compliance with state regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| and are exempt from NPC review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| So does that mean we can go out now and buy something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| and start this center and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| we could do it because there was no zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| So these are my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| I guess the big thing for me is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| if there are people all over Knox County doing these events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| without the regulation now, how did they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| How did they build these facilities and have these events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| and not have any kind of zoning changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| And I guess the other big question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| if it's in the green belt, does that make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| If it's zoned agriculture and it's in the green belt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| does that make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| So I just guess I have a lot of questions that I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| need to be answered before somebody just decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| that Knox County is not a place that needs retreat centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5222)|
| 1:27:14| Do you all have any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Okay, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5243)|
| 1:27:32| Yes, there was another lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I'll get back to you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| You went first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| You're the only one getting paid to be here, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| It's all up and it's not coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5265)|
| 1:27:55| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| My name is Linda Fitzpatrick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| and I live at 715 Graham Way in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| I've lived in Knoxville for the past four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| I relocated from New York because I'm on the leadership team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| of the American Meditation Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| and I am very grateful to Sammy and other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| who have been looking here at properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| where we can invite people not only on weekends and at sleepovers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| but day after day to come out and learn meditation with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| So I would simply say we are sincerely desiring to be in code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5316)|
| 1:28:46| so that the people who come to our retreat center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| are safe and comfortable and our neighbors are safe and happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| We're committed to being in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| We welcome code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| I, again, am a new resident of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| have taken a look at what I understand to be the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| and as Sammy points out, I, like Sammy, have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| One of the little points I made is that as I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| I see that there is a requirement for when we do periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| have overnight meditation retreats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| which are, by the way, typically very quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| we have a requirement here that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| 10 guest accommodations for every 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| When I read this, and I'm a layperson, not an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| not a code enforcement person, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| gee, that seems like an awful lot of room for just a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| So I simply say we at the American Meditation Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| are deeply invested to bring these beautiful practices here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| to this fabulous city, and we want to be in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| but we hope that compliance will be good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| We want it to be good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| We want it to be good for everyone who comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| as well as for our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5426)|
| 1:30:37| I previously stated my name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| but I'm sure that the author of the ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5439)|
| 1:30:48| can speak to the basis for a lot of the information that's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| but I know that MPC did a lot of research in looking at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5455)|
| 1:31:02| but in looking at other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| and what they had done with respect to the subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| And I think that's where a lot of this comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| common sense and a review of what others are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| You're looking at somebody that's got 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| and at one portion of that 100 acres they've got a dry quarry site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| and it would be a great venue for a musical interlude for one or two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5496)|
| 1:31:49| and the position of the county currently would be you couldn't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5509)|
| 1:32:02| without some difference in zoning or do what is being proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| Let's say that they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| and they hear performances by two or three bands one evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| and two bands the next evening, and they spend the night there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| This puts restrictions on the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| and the number of accommodations that can be used to take care of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| That's just one type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| You've got weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| You've got all sorts of social and cultural activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5556)|
| 1:32:43| many perhaps to sit here and recite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| that on occasion want to use that kind of a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| That's what this ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| I would observe that none of that activity is in contravention of any farming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5576)|
| 1:33:07| that is going on on the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| We're not trying to go regulate how they farm the remaining portion of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| but they're looking to locate these facilities at a portion of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| that they don't necessarily farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| You have people in this county that own 20 or 25 acres, don't farm at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5608)|
| 1:33:36| and would want to use this opportunity for such a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| I think that the ordinance is carefully worded enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| that it's not going to impact what type of farming activity the farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5626)|
| 1:33:55| or the owner in this particular instance is going to object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| I don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| I would say to you that the way the ordinance is crafted, that there's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5644)|
| 1:34:14| The question of whether somebody's got a 501c3 farm or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| is not going to be going out and doing this or proposing this activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| until they find out for sure what the effect is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| Or Greenbelt issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| I don't really see Greenbelt come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| but somebody that's got Greenbelt designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| and they're going to go do this on a portion of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| it's up to them to check it out and make sure they don't create a problem for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| I don't know that it's this body's obligation to take care of those kind of interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| that are personal to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| I don't think that there's nothing that was intended by the ordinance to affect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| but I would say that they would be of a mind to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| and make sure they didn't create a problem for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| I have clients who are interested in doing something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| When I first checked into it, I was told that what you were told here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| there's not a zoning classification currently in which that type of activity can take place legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5733)|
| 1:35:42| There may be some instances where people are doing this without sanction by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5742)|
| 1:35:52| and I've got at least a group of clients who wanted to make sure they were doing it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| When I was told that they were preparing an ordinance to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| that's what I've been waiting on for those clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| They're aware of this particular draft of the ordinance that's before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| and they have no issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| I think some of you may have said that there's a lot of setback here from other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5780)|
| 1:36:28| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| My clients wouldn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| I think there's maybe a 300-foot setback to the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| or the property that a house is on or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| My clients probably wouldn't care if you did away with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| but I do see the reason for having it if you have music to be played| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| or services that have to be broadcast, shall we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| that they'd like a little more removal from that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| I'm just saying on behalf of my clients, nobody likes regulations maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5827)|
| 1:37:17| but we can certainly live with these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| and there are other people that are interested in the subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| I know that there are some other concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| and if any of you have any concern and want to express it, I'll try to answer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| or I'll get one of the guys from MPC up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| or I'll call on your law director representative who's not yet said anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5863)|
| 1:37:51| but that's our posture in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| We want to engage in this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| My clients have a portion of the property that they do not farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| that is a good event site, and that's what they want to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| and they want to be legal when they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Before I go to commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| I would like to get MPC to address some of the questions that the ladies had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| because I believe once we go to us, the discussion's going to go away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| and these women did make the effort to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| to try to address specifically something that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| So I guess the question is, overnight lodging will be allowed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| Is there any difference in density per acre per tent camping, RV, or permanent structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5917)|
| 1:38:45| Should there possibly be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| That's something we could certainly look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| The idea is that these are large sites, and in order to allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| this is not intended to be for permanent commercial business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| or any kind of a hotel facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| This is intended for people that may be having an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| and have the need for a few overnight accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| and being that the minimum lot size proposed is ten acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| on a ten-acre site, the overnight lodging isn't even permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| That only comes into play when you get to 20, I believe it's 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| The setbacks came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| On a ten-acre property, a 300-foot setback is really not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| What type of zoning would they need for a type of operation that they're looking to run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| My understanding is the least intense zoning that permits it is OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| and then, of course, there's a couple commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| Most of the properties that people are looking to do this on are out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| A request for CA or OB zoning out in the middle of all ag zone land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| is not going to go very well, generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| This was providing an outlet where we could look at these on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| apply some regulations to them, and allow them when appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| That was the whole idea here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Would you add a type zoning or a use-on-review in the ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| that would allow for businesses such as these that are permanent, ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| That's exactly what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| This is saying allow these type of uses as a use-on-review in the ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| as well as those other zones that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| But I thought you said she just needed an OB zoning to do what she's wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| Currently, that's what they would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| This ordinance is being proposed to allow another avenue to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| rather than having to change an agricultural zone property out in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| to commercial, which is nearly impossible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| I'm sure members of this commission are not unaware that the OB zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| permits a rather intense residential development, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| As noted, this is taking place out in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| and all of these facilities are to be permitted as a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| If you look at the information within the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| look at the information that is required to be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| as a part of the application for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| it is a substantial amount of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| It deals with hours of operation, number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| restroom facilities, the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| and then has a minimum parcel size of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| All the buildings, other indoor outuse areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| have to be set back 200 feet from a property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| 300 feet from a residential dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| They're subject to the parking requirements for theaters, auditoriums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| and places of assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| It goes on and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| and the activities may also include swimming pools, related facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| boating facilities, tennis and other sports courts, equestrian facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| zip lines, corn maze, picnic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| I mean, you begin to get the picture if you look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| There is a permitted overnight accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6153)|
| 1:42:40| If they're permanent, there are standards to be achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| If they're not, there's a set of standards to be achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| But permanent restroom facilities are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| with the capacity of any buildings, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| It talks about lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| Any buildings have to meet the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| We have it in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| It goes on and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| and so I think that's the way to go at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| as opposed to trying to differentiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| between one specific activity as opposed to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I would like to open it up to commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| and I can't remember who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| Daly was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Mr. Archer, you were there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6216)|
| 1:43:46| This is a rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| This is someone in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| that wants to have two, three, four events a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| This is what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| This is not a commercial business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| that they're going to have 40, 50, 60 events a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| I am for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Well, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| It does not disallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| It doesn't say you can only have so many events a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| but there are very stringent standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| that in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| you're going to have to lay it out in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| that it hopefully minimizes the impact to your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| I heard the number four at the meeting a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| so that's why I said four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| There's a difference here, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| in a rural retreat in an event center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| a full-blown event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| I'm for this because it will help my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| out in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| to where if they want to have four or five hot dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| corn dog suppers or events, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| I have no problem with a lot of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| and like I say, I'm for everything that we've got so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| except for, and I'll go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| and I'll give you one example real quickly about the 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| I have a great 501c3 that's in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| not more than a quarter mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| that if this is passed and they're not grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| they would have to go for the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| because I believe they're probably within 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| of a house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| So I know a lot of them will be grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| I understand that, but that's my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| and my question to the law director is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| and I'll repeat it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| I believe that this MPC may consider the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| I think this should be either to us as commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| or to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| and I would like to have your opinion on if we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| and where do you suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| Do you want to just give them the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| It's 4.104.02, number D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| Right, so uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| go from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| Having something that is already written law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| come back before this board for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| puts the commission in an odd situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| and I'll tell you the truth, I'd recommend against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| because the Board of Zoning Appeals is a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| There are different rules of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| that apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| For instance, they can't discuss a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| that's going to be on their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| with anyone who opposes it or anyone in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| before the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| So that would put the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| in a really different mode of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| if appeals for these variances or these uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| came back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Imagine not being able to talk to your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| about something that's going to be on your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| and then hearing evidence and having to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| with a record and there would be evidence taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| and there might be an appeal to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| So to answer that question, I think the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| as it's written, provides for an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| And then to change that, you could apply for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| Of course, for the distance rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| you're well aware of the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| for applying and proving a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| You've got to prove a hardship, reasonable use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| So that's the natural...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| It's actually provided for under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| that it's the natural mode of appealing those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| So this sentence here, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| Help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| MPC may consider reduction of these setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| as part of the plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| I know if that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| that means someone would have to have the knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| the next-door neighbor would have to have the knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| that they've got to file an appeal to that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| which I would rather see it the other way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| where it would have to be part of a variance, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| I mean, it may not be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Well, the way I hear you voicing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6497)|
| 1:48:25| is you want to take away the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to reduce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| I mean, is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Do you want it to be a hard and fast rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| at the Metropolitan Planning Commission level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| And it's got to be that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Well, it could be 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| And then if the applicant wants to go to 290 or 250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| that would be an application to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Right, so these uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| inevitably go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| You can maybe revise the language a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| to give more discretion there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| between whatever your maximum and minimum distances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| you think are appropriate for these uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| to be near property lines and near adjacent residential dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| But the natural mode of these issues being appealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| is always from Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| to the Board of Zoning Appeals and then to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| Okay, I'll turn it over to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6572)|
| 1:49:41| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| I guess one challenge I'm having with this whole ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| is related to this and the definition of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| One point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| I'm married to a country girl, but I'm not a country guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| So just as I've learned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| it does sound like a country song, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| But we do have a very clear, by our state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| a definition of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| And as I understand it, after speaking to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| from the Tennessee Farm Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| we as a county commission are not allowed to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| or to zone agriculture-related businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| That seems pretty clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| Some of this could fall under what would meet my definition of agritourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| And when you look at the definition of agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| one of the definitions is entertainment activities conducted in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| but secondary to commercial production of farm products and nursery stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| when such activities occur on land used for the commercial production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| I think we've got two different issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| I've heard from a farmer who is a friend of mine that lives in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| and she's been very clear that she's worried that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| because she's operating a farming business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| and the mission of what she's doing in her job of operating her farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| our county body cannot and should not regulate that farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| And under agritourism, she's probably got the right already to do some of these activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| if it falls under agritourism and entertainment value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| And if you've got an ag business that meets this, you should be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| I'll need some clarification on that from our authorities, but that's my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| Additionally, you have, and I think where part of the birth of this ordinance came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| is we do have folks who might have land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| but they are not operating an agriculture-related business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| And I think that's where this is getting a little bit confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| because I'd like to hope that most of us agree that we don't want to get into the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| and we legally cannot get in the business of regulating farmers as the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| But what we're trying to do is find opportunities where we have land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| that is not being used necessarily for agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| that there could be a highest and best use for this land, maybe as an event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| And where I would want to see, and I think maybe some of our friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| and I'd be curious if my friend Neil Denton and some of our community here could weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| is there some additional clarification on the difference between ag-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| and if you have land that is not being used for ag-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| because that, to me, is what this ordinance is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| And I'm cool with that, but I don't want to get us down the path of regulating our farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| I'd like to recognize Neil Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| Neil Denton, 400 West Main, UT, Knox County Agriculture Extension Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| The question that's come up with many of the producers that have seen this is exactly what you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| is that they're already regulated and defined, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| as people who have an ag-related business that can do events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| entertainment venues through agritourism on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| It's allowed by state law to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| And they don't want this as an added regulation on top of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| that would cause some problems for their farming operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6812)|
| 1:53:39| So, basically, this rule retreat seems to be in conflict, at least on the ag side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6819)|
| 1:53:49| with some of the state statutes that are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| So many of our producers are concerned about this adding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| and restricting what they can do on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| which is already governed by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| Any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| I'd like to hear from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| So, Tennessee is very unique when it comes to the protections of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| They've gone far and away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| They've gone past other states in protecting agriculture and agricultural-related uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| And it's true that anything that this body does under its zoning authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6871)|
| 1:54:40| could not regulate the agricultural uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6880)|
| 1:54:47| Our legislature has gone to the trouble of defining agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| Agriculture has four different subparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| The first one is the land, buildings, and machinery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| used in the commercial production of farm products and nursery stocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| So, land, buildings, machinery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| You've got hayfield, cornfield, the barn, the silo, and the tractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| Combine, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| And subsection B, it's activity carried on in connection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| That's fairly broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| But there has to be some sort of connection there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| between commercial production of farm products and nursery stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| and this activity that's carried on in connection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| I imagine that to be something like watering the crops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| taking water from the river type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| Subpart C, recreational and educational activities on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| used for the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| So, recreational and educational activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| But that has to occur on land used for the commercial production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| Corn maize, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| And then, most recently, the legislature has added the fourth category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| entertainment activities that are conducted in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| but secondary to commercial production of farm products and nursery stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| when such activities occur on land used for the commercial production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| So it's fairly broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| But there are circumstances where a property owner isn't engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| in any of these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| And they want to be permitted on agriculturally zoned land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| And I think there's another thing that we need to take care to separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| There are agricultural uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Those are the things that I just wrote out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| There's also agricultural zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| And the two aren't necessarily the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| because there are certain non-agricultural uses that are permitted in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| That doesn't make them agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| There are any number of single one-acre lot subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| that they're not engaged in any type of agriculture, but it's residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| And so the county does regulate that through its zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| but the agriculture is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| And just because it's zoned ag doesn't mean it is ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| And so this ordinance that's been recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| could not be interpreted to regulate any of the agricultural uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| that state law exempts from zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| It just couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| What it does regulate, I think, and could be interpreted to regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| are situations where you don't have any agricultural use in a rural setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7076)|
| 1:58:05| And the person who owns that property wants to engage in the types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| that are outlined here in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| They want to build a facility for the purpose of providing in a rural setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| in which lodging, conferences, banquet facilities, restaurants, day spas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| recreational amenities, and meeting events facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| that have absolutely nothing to do with agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| And so we couldn't interpret it to regulate ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7112)|
| 1:58:40| but where somebody has a piece of property and they want to put it to higher and better use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| and they don't engage in ag, that's where this ordinance would permit that type of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| I don't know. Is that my microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| I think it's Neal's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| And, yes, that is understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| The concern has been in some of the language and some of the things that were said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| and that seems to lead you to think that normal agricultural operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| that do have events and entertainment as part of their secondary inflow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| would be subject under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| That would be prohibited by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| Who decides on this slippery slope what makes the cut and what doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| as far as agricultural production?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| Those are always questions of fact that rise and fall on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| on the circumstances of an individual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| One of the cases that is a seminal case in this area is Maple Lane Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7189)|
| 1:59:59| It's down there in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| At that trial, former Commissioner Leuthold gave testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| about what was an agricultural use and what wasn't an agricultural use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| and testified in favor of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7212)|
| 2:00:18| You would establish that with testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| If this ordinance is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| the county code enforcement department is not out policing agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| to see if there are event facilities that don't comply with an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| or a zoning regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| They have to receive a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| and they would go out and they would follow up on the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| They would gather information and make a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Well, is this agriculture or is this not agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| That would sort of start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| If there's a piece of agriculturally zoned land and a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| that has nothing to do with agriculture but would fall under this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| is going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| then the code administration could issue a stop work order or a cease and desist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| and then they'd have to come before the NPC to ask for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| or get the text of the zoning amendment changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| so that they could operate the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| I mean, I feel like I'm rambling a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| but I'm trying to address several questions at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| Take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| The question, I guess, is, Mr. Brousseau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| and I don't know if you have a computer down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| I'm looking at Hunter Valley Farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| and I guess it's got a split zoning on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| Most of it's ag except for the commercial business, the entertainment venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| What's the T zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| I can't remember what that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| T is transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| Okay, so why are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| So if we have this example, this is a perfect example, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| So why are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| We've got the T transition zoning anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| Why are we recreating something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| Well, that T transition zoning allows other uses such as multifamily, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| I'd have to look in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| But there's some other uses that in certain locations would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| So why don't we amend transition instead of ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| to take the fear out of everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| Because transition would be difficult to get in rural areas in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| That's really what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| All right, so if somebody is currently on an ag zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| and they don't have any farming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| there's nothing agriculture except for cutting the grass, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| and they're operating a venue for weddings or a venue for parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| is that out of ordinance currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| If it's not related to agricultural at all, I would say it is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| And would this zoning fix that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| It would at least give the opportunity if they can meet the certain criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| and get approved at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| And that was one thing I wanted to bring up is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| these all will be subject to public hearing at MPC level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| so there will be the opportunity for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| if somebody is wanting to reduce the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| like Commissioner Daly said, you know, if somebody is against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| But the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| it says that we can't even consider that reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| unless we've got permission from the adjacent property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| who would be affected as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| But, yeah, that was a very unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| And fortunately, because that Hunter Valley Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| is in the vicinity of North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| and a lot of commercial businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| it was not an impossible task to get it rezoned to transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| whereas out in the middle of an all-agriculture area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| that would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| My next question, I guess, Mr. Sellers, you had called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| Do you have any questions or comments right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| from the Cattlemen's Association, or are you satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| I think right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| Mr. Chairman, let me follow up with the last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| that my fellow commissioner had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| It was calling on one person asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| do you have a concern or question about this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| or this additional ordinance language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| Is there anyone else in the audience that's here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| that, as we've worked through this for about 50 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| do you have a concern that you've not heard addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| Because we need your question now, or I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7493)|
| 2:05:00| I just have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Please come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| And, Tom, I can do it from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7506)|
| 2:05:14| That's an event center, and what Mike has told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| there's a difference between a retreat center and an event center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| and in a retreat center, people spend the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Event centers like Hunter Valley Farms, they don't spend the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| And because we would have people spend the night, isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| It puts it in a whole different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| Well, the way this ordinance is laid out is that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| the bigger the event facility is, then you can have accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| I'll be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| I'm not even sure that the meditation certainly was not intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| for that kind of thing, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| I'm not positive, and I maybe need to get your opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| So here's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| If we just make some soap and raise some chickens, we'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| And going along, following that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| earlier in your testimony you said that there were 40 or 50 event centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Were you counting 40 or 50 event centers in the ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| that were in code violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| No, I'm just saying there's at least that many that are operating now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| that I know of having weddings and all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| But they could be in a zone that is properly for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| So we're talking about something that is not 45 or 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| I just wanted to make sure I was clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| Now then, back to anyone else in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| is there a question about this ag ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7591)|
| 2:06:39| I need to hear it because I am a farm guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| My name is Rachel Somolsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| My address is 1431 Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| A sixth generation farmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| our concern is going back to the definitions of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| Again, I can get you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| The state has spoken, and they're very clear about what the ag is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| They have encouraged farmers, in order to preserve your farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| you can diversify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| We used to be a dairy farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| There's no money in that, so we had to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| We became a beef cattle farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| The state encourages farms to welcome agritourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| Agritourism does many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| It brings the public in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| You can educate children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| You can educate adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| People get to see a farm at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| So there's some concern from the agritourism operators that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| there is the line at the very back that would protect those farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| the corn mazes and such, but the confusion, if it's not resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7670)|
| 2:07:58| you have to, at what point does it get resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| You know, if you want to do a corn maze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| and there's some confusion and whether it's not protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| you've got to go before and you've got to do all this thing to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| yes, I am protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| That's where we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| It's just not quite explicit enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| And I think it does serve a purpose for the people that want to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| there and have these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| I don't think the farmers are opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| We just want to make sure that it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7705)|
| 2:08:32| So then let me ask the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| is there anything changing in this ordinance for stuff that's directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| against agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| This is only adding additional services in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| That's the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| Thank you, Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| You're about to bust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| Has anybody on this day read this front to back three or four times like I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| Have you seen what agriculture is in this law from the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7744)|
| 2:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| It defines what a farm is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| It tells you what a farm is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| The problem that we talked about, Rachel, would you come back up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| I'm sorry, I'm going to quiz this young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| She looks like she can take all kinds of quizzes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Right, Rachel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Okay, we'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| I'm going to do some inquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| The things that you're worried about, I think we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| which you didn't bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| In the first section right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| it talks about rural retreats are subject to the requirements in Section 410| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| through 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| Have you seen those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Have you brought them out and you've read those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| Have you got those separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| It says it has to deal that you're adopting the same thing that you have in the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| which goes on to this that talks about agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| It talks about the use is consistent with adopted plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| and policies including in the general plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Farms are not subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| My point earlier is this is a great piece of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| but you just can't include the term agriculture or anything referred to as a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7822)|
| 2:10:30| because the state law says we cannot legislate this kind of, I think it says by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7830)|
| 2:10:38| and this is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| How long has your farm been around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| What is it, 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| 1801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| So we want to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| We want to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| So they want to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Now, some people don't want to do the farming, and like I said, it specifies it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| There may be a special zoning that you need for farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| that is not being used in any fashion, form, as in farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| If you're raising hay to feed your cattle on 30 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| and you've got another 20 acres someplace else that you have your cattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| then that is a farm use because they're using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| It's a primary use of farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| What we're talking about, the ones that they're trying to legislate for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| is people that are not using their property primarily for farming or agricultural use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7888)|
| 2:11:36| That's not the farmer's problem, and that's not our problem to try to legislate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| That's some things we have to get for our zoning for those particular events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| that they're talking back there that has nothing really to do as a subpart of a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7905)|
| 2:11:54| Now, we've got to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| We cannot take this and pass it with anything attached as agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| what I said earlier, because that breaks state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Now, if you want this other, we're going to have to make a zoning for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| or a use someplace else in our zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| because if we add this to the agriculture, we're putting undue problems on the farmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7936)|
| 2:12:23| and the state says we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| Now, that's only my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| I'm going to go to Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| She hasn't got a chance to speak yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| Thank you, Commissioner Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| I think this is pretty much re-saying what Charlie has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| that the way this ordinance right now is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| it doesn't really clarify and put our farms being completely exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7964)|
| 2:12:53| because they are by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| So we need to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| make sure that the ordinance clarifies exactly what we're trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| and that it keeps our farmers and our farms completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| So I think we just kind of need to rewrite some of the words and restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7990)|
| 2:13:19| Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| You know, there would be no problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| and I don't think it would be a substantial revision to add a clause to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| that says that this ordinance could not be interpreted contrary to the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| and you could cite the state statute in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| I mean, that's something that it can't do anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| but if you want it to be clear about it, if you want to be explicit, just rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| I think in this day and time and with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| we need to put as much clarification in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| so that no one can take one word off of it and try to change it in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| to protect our farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| Right, and that's not going to add anything to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| or it's not going to take anything away from it as it's currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| Mr. Goodmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| First, there's nothing in this ordinance that references a 501C corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8047)|
| 2:14:14| Second, I did want to thank the community who owns Family Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| and the Cattlemen's Association for jumping on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| and letting us know that, hey, we might potentially have a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| I appreciate you guys coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| Mike, you remember our, I guess, public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| with about half of the Commission and the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| Back to what Commissioner Daley was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| I think we need to have it ironclad on page 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| under that section 4.104.02, section D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| where if somebody is going into doing this type of facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| and it's for 10 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| that they can at least maintain a 200-foot setback from the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8100)|
| 2:15:07| And if they decide to do a parking lot or a building or an outdoor area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| that they're at least 300 feet from the adjoining residential home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| I think that needs to be locked down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| and that's why I agree with Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| that it shouldn't be administrative on your part that you just guys go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| okay, well, you can't hit the 200, we'll give you 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| that it has to go before the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| I think in this kind of thing where you've got sound and a lot of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| it's not the same as a residential zone where a developer needs 25-foot setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8145)|
| 2:15:51| as opposed to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| This should be ironclad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| The other thing in the document on page 5 where it references 4.104.03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8155)|
| 2:16:05| this is for parcels in excess of 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| I think you need to strike number 4 where it says 50 or more attendees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| And this is on the sound ordinance that between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| they must go into a fully enclosed building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| if you want to still stick with that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| But the number of attendees should be stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| In fact, at our formal meeting I'll make sure that we adjust that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8196)|
| 2:16:43| because that's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| I think the other thing we're getting a little confused on is in 71| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| when we put the zoning classifications in place for all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| was it 71, 72, 73?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| Somewhere's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| Basically, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| that anything that was out in the county that wasn't in a residential commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| we just said that's agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| It didn't mean it had a farm on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| It was just agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| So I could own 100 acres and it'd be a forest that I'm going to use for logging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| but that was agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| It could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| So what we're trying to do here is prevent, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| we don't want a Bonnaroo coming in here without any kind of rules or regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| That is a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| And if you're going to go into a commercial enterprise with a rural retreat type facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| you need to have the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| That's the whole idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| We're not trying to do anything to harm the family farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| that I can see in these regulations right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| And I'm hoping my friends out here in the audience, if there is, they'll let me know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| Mr. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| My neighbor in Hardin Valley, where we have some farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| he does birthday parties on Saturdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| and he could have 100 children there on three or four birthdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| and they have ponies and they do pony rides, and it's agribusiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| Now, it just doesn't make sense to make him change any zoning to do the things he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| The same thing is true with the haunted forest and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8305)|
| 2:18:33| I can't tell you how many weddings have been on my place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| People say, can we get married down by the creek and the waterfall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| All the cars pull in and they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| It's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| I don't think that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| What I think is a big deal is when you have a commercial business building a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| or operating overnight or doing something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| where people are charged to come into the facility and they do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8333)|
| 2:18:59| It's kind of like the people who do flea market stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| You can drive down the road and find a guy who's got a building there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| and he does it every weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| That's his livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| But that's not what you do in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| You have your broad sale and you do it once a year or twice a year and that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| I think we're going way too far with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| I think we leave it alone, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| I just want to say that I hope everyone understands agriculture will be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| I don't think that our law department, our code department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| will bother agricultural period by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| I can see that I've got 25, 30 acres and I want to build a ropes course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| or I want to build a team building course that I can have people come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| four, five, six times a year to do team building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| That's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| It has nothing to do with agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| It's about a one, two, three, 20 times a year event, team building skills and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| This is what I think this is covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| What we're trying to cover is not anything about agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| It's safe in agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8405)|
| 2:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Are we ready to move on to the next one or is there any more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Senator Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| For clarification for the audience, for those that have came for the public forum on the first item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| I guess it would be most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| Earlier in the meeting today we moved it without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| which means that there was discussion of a postponement if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| but next Monday's vote will be the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| It will come in the regular, not the 7 o'clock, but the regular commission meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| It's on the regular ordinances, not in the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| What will it be, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Which is 6 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| So 7 o'clock next Monday is when this will be voted on or postponed for the public knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8473)|
| 2:21:31| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| Hold on, let me check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| I'll check with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| Could we take a two-minute break here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| It's on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| This is on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| I think she puts them to the 7 o'clock, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| Bud, what's the rule on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| It's a zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| Does it go at 5 or does it go at 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| A zoning ordinance goes at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| That's what it was on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8517)|
| 2:22:04| Go take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| You want to take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| I'm making you guys ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| We're going to go into recess and we'll meet back here and start back up at 7.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| We found it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| Okay, Madam Clerk, could you read the next zoning ordinance amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| Yes, the next ordinance is O-17-8-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| It is proposing amendments to the Knox County Code Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| zoning Article II, Section 2.20, specific terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| Article V, Section 5.36, T transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| and Section 5.41, OB office medical and related services zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| and added a new Article IV, Section 4.105,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| standards for use on review approval of supportive housing related to supporting housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8568)|
| 2:22:57| Is there anybody from the public that wishes to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8577)|
| 2:23:10| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8590)|
| 2:23:18| Can you give your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| It would, again, suggest that you call upon representatives of MPC to discuss the origin of this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8601)|
| 2:23:34| ordinance and its provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| We have, by virtue of this ordinance amendment, supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8620)|
| 2:23:52| and that's a defined term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8632)|
| 2:24:02| and approval of such a facility is on the basis of a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8642)|
| 2:24:13| There are various types of, quote, supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| I happen to represent a client who is in supportive housing for recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8659)|
| 2:24:30| people in recovery from substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| and it is not a facility that treats with medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| There's no medication dispensed at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| It has its target population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| and you are, in essence, adding to the list of uses to be permitted as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8695)|
| 2:25:07| the transition zone and the OB zone, the office medical and related services zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8707)|
| 2:25:15| The property we have is currently a zoned transitional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8715)|
| 2:25:24| but at the time we submitted our request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8724)|
| 2:25:31| this was a type of activity that wasn't permitted in the transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8731)|
| 2:25:38| This is now permitting this activity to be done in two zoning classifications within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8738)|
| 2:25:48| There's a set of standards in here that are designed, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8748)|
| 2:25:59| from members of MPC staff designed with the idea that the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8759)|
| 2:26:09| can nail down conditions related to the particular request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| and that was certainly the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| The use on review has to identify what type of service they are giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8783)|
| 2:26:31| It's got certain restrictions as to how close it may be to another such facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8791)|
| 2:26:43| and also a restriction on how close they must be to public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8803)|
| 2:26:50| or to provide for alternate means of transportation necessary for the people in care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8810)|
| 2:27:05| We have to, under this use on review, anybody would have to give their target population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| that they're going to serve, provide a description of the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| and related matters to the delivery of that particular service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| and they also have to comply with any state or federal requirements for their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8843)|
| 2:27:33| I can tell you the facility that we operate does not require state licensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8853)|
| 2:27:42| but in any event, the proposed ordinance is set out in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8862)|
| 2:27:52| and the material you have in the background is there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8872)|
| 2:27:57| I would hope, Commissioner Daly, that we do not postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8877)|
| 2:28:05| We started this activity in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| and we have been gently shuttled around the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8890)|
| 2:28:18| We started at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| We got MPC approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| We got to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| We got sent back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| Time was spent to come up with this that you have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8910)|
| 2:28:35| and we're here again on approval from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| Mr. King, your time's up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| And we would ask that Monday that this get approved, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8923)|
| 2:28:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| and members that were at the work session on these ordinances that we had with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8941)|
| 2:29:08| but basically one of the citizens had brought to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| that maybe we need two classifications for this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| one that just specifically addresses supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| which cannot exclude alcohol and prescription drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| and another ordinance that specifies recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8969)|
| 2:29:35| which will not allow any alcohol or no drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| So, you know, yeah, we kicked this back to MPC back in March of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8979)|
| 2:29:47| but I think we owe it to the citizens of Knox County that we get an ordinance that's the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8987)|
| 2:29:54| And I don't think we need to try to group it all into one big category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| If we need to separate it and have two categories, let's do the right thing and do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=8998)|
| 2:30:04| But it would take the direction of this body to address to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| that we need to have the rules and regulations for two separate zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9008)|
| 2:30:15| And I could defer to my colleague to the right, who's an expert on this, if he wants to give any input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9015)|
| 2:30:25| Are you an expert on alcohol or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9025)|
| 2:30:30| Well, most of my background in social work is more around child abuse and that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| But, yeah, this is something where I know we want to find a way where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9036)|
| 2:30:44| I know we want to find a way to try and make something happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| and we're focusing awfully close on this particular deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| but I'm also thinking about what the next one after that and after that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9050)|
| 2:30:55| I personally don't have a problem with this business, and I know they're trying to do the right thing for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| My only question, though, Mr. King, I know you said that they're not required to have a license by the state in your statement earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| so I would like some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| But I'm just trying to tag on to what Commissioner Schoonmaker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| I'm just thinking about what is the ones after this going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| and if we need any additional clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| Mr. King, would you like to clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| I'm not sure what the last part of that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| I was getting confirmation about no state licensure required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| Yeah, I just wanted to get some clarification on no state licensure requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| You may want to have our guest from the agency clarify that, if that's not in your wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9092)|
| 2:31:40| I have a representative of my client here, and she can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9100)|
| 2:31:48| She's checked, and that's our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9108)|
| 2:31:59| If you will, give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| I'm Natali Evans, 717 Ebenezer Road, and I'm not an expert on this by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9121)|
| 2:32:07| I just know to have licensure, medical treatment has to be given, handed out meds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9127)|
| 2:32:16| and we don't do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| There's a lot of stuff that goes into it, and like I said, I'm not an expert on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| I just know we do not have to have licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| We contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| I've gotten a letter from them that we do not have to have licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9149)|
| 2:32:34| That's about as much as I know on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| Before you sit down, if you don't have to have a licensure, you're not a recovery center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9160)|
| 2:32:51| You're a group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| Are your clients court ordered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| How do you get clients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| I get clients from several different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| Pull the mic down for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| I get clients from several places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| I work with drug courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| We work with a lot of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| So if drug courts gives you a client, how are you held in compliance if you have no state regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9193)|
| 2:33:20| What do you mean, how am I held in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| Who's to say you're not throwing a party every three weeks and then getting them sober for a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| Who checks you and regulates you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| We're checked by drug courts at my place weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| Kind of the proof's in the pudding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| I've been doing this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| I've worked for a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Our success rate, we've got pretty much one of the best facilities around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9221)|
| 2:33:47| We have outside agencies come in and do groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| That goes into the state licensing too, the treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9232)|
| 2:33:57| We have agencies come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| So you farm that part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| We outsource the mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| We outsource, you know, we send them to a helicopter back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| You're a boarding house and they provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| I mean, the zoning stuff is just, it gets real technical, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| I was just a little concerned we weren't opening up something that we didn't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| Commissioner David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| I guess this is addressed to Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| I'm not against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| I'm more concerned about Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'll go ahead and put the A in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| and Commissioner Nystrom that I think we need to, I also agree that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| we need supportive and recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| And I guess my question to MPC staff is, is this possible that we can separate it into two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9281)|
| 2:34:48| How tough will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| It was something that was actually considered, drafting this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| and we kind of debated back and forth on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| One of the things you have to really be careful in drafting any kind of ordinance with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| is compliance with the American Disabilities Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| and that you're not segregating out people that are covered with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| And so actually in drafting this, we sent it to Nashville and HUD to make sure it was in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9311)|
| 2:35:19| And so you can't segregate out different classes of people that might be covered with disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9319)|
| 2:35:26| So people that are addicts are covered as far as the ADA law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| So we thought it was basically easier as far as compliance with law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| and basically that there's a lot of, it's a growing issue in our society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9336)|
| 2:35:42| whether you're talking about medical treatment, as far as drug treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9342)|
| 2:35:48| there's many different kinds of alcohol and drugs where you're talking to this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| who was relying on another source, another agency to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| Sometimes it's done internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| So there's a variety of ways that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| And the one thing you could see as far as the use on review criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| that staff thought it was very important to hone in on the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9370)|
| 2:36:16| that the planning commission needs to make sure that any type of use that fits this definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9376)|
| 2:36:23| and is looking in a certain particular area to make sure it fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| So it would go through the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| just like the other ordinance that was above you as far as rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9392)|
| 2:36:38| But we wanted to be more inclusive as far as the different types of treatment that occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9398)|
| 2:36:48| and make sure that the planning commission has all the necessary information to make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9408)|
| 2:36:54| if that use is appropriate in that setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| Mr. Archer, I'm sorry, I was talking, distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| Could you please repeat what you said about the ADA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| The American Disability Act, one of the people that are included is mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9428)|
| 2:37:14| and also people with addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| Is that current or recovering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| The way it's worded right now is addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| I think probably if something is to be separated out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| I think we may need to forward this to somebody that specializes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| Just like our previous version, we sent it out to a field expert from the Nashville HUD Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9458)|
| 2:37:46| that exclusively deals with fair housing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| And that would be more in permanent housing or temporary housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| Or would it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| You're borderline, I think, uncovering something that might be in violation with the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| So just as a kind of a double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| I agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner Nystrom and Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| in that I feel that treatment and recovery are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9493)|
| 2:38:22| And sometimes we can get, I think they should be separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9502)|
| 2:38:29| If I'm following what was suggested was a class called recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9509)|
| 2:38:38| what was the difference in that and a supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9518)|
| 2:38:45| In recovery housing, you cannot exclude alcohol or substances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9525)|
| 2:38:55| And in supportive housing, you can't exclude it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9535)|
| 2:39:04| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| You cannot in supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| You cannot exclude alcohol and prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| In recovery housing, there's no alcohol, no substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| In recovery housing, you can exclude those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| Say that again, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| In recovery housing, you can exclude alcohol and substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9564)|
| 2:39:35| Apparently so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| And that's why I think it's good if we had two ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| and then you could submit both ordinances to the ADA field office in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| and let them look at it and see if they don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| Because I don't think we're doing any regulations that restrict people that have wheelchairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9590)|
| 2:39:56| anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| What do we do when you have a facility such as my client?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9599)|
| 2:40:04| In supportive housing, they cannot exclude alcohol and substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| That's exactly what they currently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| Then maybe they're in a recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| That makes them in a recovery house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| Well, then let's have an ordinance that says recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| That's what we're trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| There's differentiations, and I think the MPC staff is professional enough to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| But let them come back to us with two different ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| and then we can have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| Are the standards the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| Are the standards the same for each facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9640)|
| 2:40:45| I'm not the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Well, the point I'm making or would make about that, they've already been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| As Mr. Archer said, that very point was considered when they drafted the ordinance to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9654)|
| 2:41:01| The suggestion was made at the time by some other person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| that maybe you wanted to do two different classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| They looked at it and decided, no, you'd come with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9671)|
| 2:41:18| Mr. Archer, is your organization adamantly opposed to two different classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| for a supportive and recovery housing ordinance for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| I don't think it's the point I was making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| If you look at the MPC agenda packet when it went before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| there was a letter submitted by Margo Klein as part of the public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| that addressed I think what you're talking about as far as separating of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| So it was something that staff talked about before it went before the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| and it also was something that was part of the Planning Commission's record when they voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| So my only point is I don't know if it's a favor or not favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| but it was something that was considered during the vote and before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9724)|
| 2:42:10| But they didn't have anything else to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| They only had one ordinance in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| They didn't have two to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| But anyways, I'll defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| My understanding is, Mr. Archer, that we went to this one supportive housing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9744)|
| 2:42:31| because it might be ADA and HUD specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| Did I hear that correctly or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| I think we erred as far as making it a little bit more broad as far as definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9758)|
| 2:42:43| so we didn't put the county in legal jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| I guess, Daniel, you got anything to weigh in on whether we needed two separate ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9768)|
| 2:42:59| By and large, I think it's up to the county commission to define the types of uses that it wants to permit in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9779)|
| 2:43:08| and that's essentially what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9788)|
| 2:43:13| I am going to make the recommendation that we make one small change to this particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| in order to pass the Fair Housing Act muster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| and that is to change the number of occupants or residents in one of these facilities to six instead of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9803)|
| 2:43:33| That's because when you're dealing with either the ADA or the Fair Housing Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| you can't allow a certain number of persons without disability to have less restrictions on their residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9819)|
| 2:43:51| than people who may be even regarded as having a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| So our zoning ordinance permits five unrelated people to live together anywhere in the county, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9836)|
| 2:44:05| In order to place these restrictions on supportive housing, it's my opinion that we need six instead of five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9845)|
| 2:44:18| because we can't allow five people without disability to live together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9858)|
| 2:44:25| and then restrict the right of people with disability to live in the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9865)|
| 2:44:32| But that's not a substantial revision that can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9872)|
| 2:44:38| It's my recommendation if you adopt this ordinance and you make that revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| You're referring, I take it, in the recommendation that I've got, it's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9884)|
| 2:44:52| It says housing for five persons or more, and then it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9892)|
| 2:44:58| You're talking about changing the five to a six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| Let's move on to our last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9908)|
| 2:45:15| This discussion is for Ordinance O-17-8-103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9915)|
| 2:45:20| proposing amendments to the Knox County Code Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| zoning Article V, Section 5.38, CN Neighborhood Commercial Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| and adding a new Article IV, Section 4.106, Standards for the Use and Review Approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9927)|
| 2:45:33| of Self-Service Storage Facilities in the CN Zoning District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| related to self-service storage facilities in the CN Neighborhood Commercial Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9937)|
| 2:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| Anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| Yeah, I believe this was one of the ones that was, if it was closest to being correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| without any revisions, this was the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| And mainly because the Home Builders, Greater Knoxville Home Builders Association was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9959)|
| 2:46:05| and a citizen, and they brought out two, Mr. Green, Mr. Archer, I think, was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9965)|
| 2:46:13| Amy, were you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| I was not there, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| But they answered a lot of questions on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| so this one is pretty much done because it answered their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9979)|
| 2:46:25| Anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| Besides Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| How many clients you got here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9992)|
| 2:46:33| I appreciate the brevity of your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| but when you said this one's done or almost done, which way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=9995)|
| 2:46:43| In support of it or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| In support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10013)|
| 2:46:54| Mr. Huber, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| Can I get a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170918?start=10023)|
