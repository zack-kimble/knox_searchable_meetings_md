| 0:15:01| Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Under monthly disclosures, why is it necessary for people to list their occupation and employer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=909)|
| 0:15:20| And do you have any kind of concern that, I mean, people are unemployed, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| a fun thing to have to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| And then, is it necessary to kind of keep track of people who work at companies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| they might, I don't know, it just feels a little invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| The state reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Mr. McKay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Who you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| I'm the administrator of elections for Knox County, room 218 in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| And the state law, the financial disclosures require you to put the employer down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| And, you know, I guess in a way you can see that if somebody's given thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| or if some group of realtors or developers or teachers or whatever, you want to see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| pattern there, I believe is the theory behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| As far as requiring for the city ordinance, it hasn't been required up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| but it was added to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| And it wasn't my suggestion, so I don't really want to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| What was the thinking about it not being included in the city ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| It just wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Yeah, I wasn't there when the city ordinance, I wasn't around when the city ordinance, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| I wasn't at the election commission when I was around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| So, tell me again about the pattern that you would want to identify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Well, I think the theory behind having it in the state law is if people from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| one group of employment are funding a lot of money and people want to know whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| the developers or what have you, you know, they want to see a pattern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| That's why they do it for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Or whether it's lawyers or teachers or whatever the group is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| As to why it would be necessary for small donations under $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| See, the state, you've got to report any name of anybody who gives you more than $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| The city, you're required to give every penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| So, I'm not sure why you'd want to know, you know, who's giving you $10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| but I can see the theory behind who's giving you a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| I'm curious to hear what other people think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| It just feels intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Councilman Pavlis, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Yes, sir, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Well, you know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| I want to dovetail off of Councilman Woodhull's concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| I think there's a lot of concern around this whole ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| I think that it's headed in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| and I think the intent at the end of the day will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| But I don't think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I just think there's a lot of confusion about this ordinance as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| And I really think if we want a good, solid ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| because I'll tell you, once we pass this and codify this whole deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| then it's really hard to go back and ever change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| So we need to, I think, postpone it, have a workshop on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| and do the diligence more than we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| You know, we're still asking questions amongst ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| So, to me, I think the appropriate thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| and I'll make that motion after I hear from my fellow council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| is to perhaps postpone this probably for 90 days because we've got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| we've got some quite a few, you know, quite a few workshops coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| We've got the budget, but, you know, we're hired to do a hard job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| and we need to keep with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| But I do think it warrants, you know, a good workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| and vetting in a session like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| Before I recognize Council Member Palmer and Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| I failed to recognize the Boy Scout troop that is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| And if you all would stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| I don't have information where you're from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Does somebody want to come down and tell us where you're from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| and what troop you represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| We're from Knoxville, and I'm from 451.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| And this is my troop over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Well, thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Is this your scout master over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| I'm the – well, I go to the Boy Scout troop in Fairgate Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1184)|
| 0:20:00| And we're Troop 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| And I am in the Cobra Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| I think we're all working on our citizenship in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| We're a badge tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Well, we thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Give him a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| And let me apologize for interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| And I recognize Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Well, I really appreciate the spirit and intent behind this proposal right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| And mainly what it's trying to do is really clean up disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| and also streamline the process to make it easier for candidates to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| I actually was glad to hear the comments from Mr. Whittle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| because his concerns had actually gone through my mind for large amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| I think absolutely a person's employer should be disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| I think when you get into large amounts of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| the ability for large businesses to influence campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| I think we all know what the danger is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| My concern a bit, though, is on the very small donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| You get down to $100 less where just the regular ordinary citizen wants to contribute to a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| I've got some concern about where there might be a chilling effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| if just regular ordinary citizens have to list whether they have a job and who they work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| People who might not necessarily, they want to contribute to a campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| but they don't necessarily want to politicize it in their workplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| or have the employer to be concerned that their name is listed on a website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| where people might draw a conclusion that just because one of their employees gave $20 to a particular candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| that might necessarily reflect on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| So I've got an open mind on it, and the intent was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| But I do have some concerns about having to give all that information just for very small amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Council Member Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I'm the one who brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| And there were several concerns that prompted this ordinance to come forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| One of them was that it was a lot of confusion about reporting dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| Right now we have four announced candidates for mayor and, I don't know, eight or nine council candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| It's conceivable that without this ordinance that we can have 11 separate reporting dates for council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| The state dates are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I mean, there's no way around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| But the monthly reports could be varied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and it makes it difficult for citizens to keep up with who's contributing to whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| And, you know, there's always a big race about who's got a lot of money and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| The reason that I wanted to add the contributions under $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| and the employer was that at the state level generally it was considered that $100, you know, you can see some trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1385)|
| 0:23:15| There's also a very strong possibility that an employer could really encourage a large group of employees to give $75, $99, $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1395)|
| 0:23:31| so that collectively it becomes a sizable amount, several thousand dollars for a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| So that is a concern that I had which led me to want to include this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| I realized that if I give $10 to someone's campaign that it seems somewhat frivolous to put down all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| At the same time, if my employer asked 100 of us to give $50, then we begin to add up some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| So that was the reason that I thought that it was important to include the name and address of the contributor as well as their occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| As we all know, sometimes you don't know what one of your contributors actually does for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| And so it is also reasonable that you can use best effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Am I correct, Mr. McKay, to put that information down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| It satisfies the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| But the intent of this was not to cause someone to be embarrassed, feel awkward, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| It was simply to prevent one, two, or three people from really encouraging their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| or insisting, even though that's not legal, that their employees donate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| and then it really becomes a reflection of an employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| I think that something that's near and dear to the heart of Tennesseans is the national championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| And we know that the Fiesta Bowl Committee has recently gotten in very deep, troubled waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| because of some contributions to campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Local politics does not generally raise the kind of money that a state election or a national election raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1505)|
| 0:25:14| It still has the same opportunities for a small group of people to really try to have a heavy hand in the outcome of the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1514)|
| 0:25:25| So for that reason, I thought this was very important to be a part of this ordinance that we, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| want to get people reporting at the same time so that someone can go and see that everybody here reported on the same date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| and, B, that we know who they're working for or where they're getting their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| I wanted to raise two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| One, in response to Mr. Pavlis' suggestion, I'm a little concerned that if we take 90 days to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| we're basically bypassing this current election, that it will be over before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| So that makes me a little reluctant to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| I think the date part is certainly a very, to have a certain date where you have to file is a very healthy thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| because it clears up confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| It avoids a bunch of phone calls and mistakes and issues about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| And as Councilwoman Palmer said, it lets the voters know when they can go check the website and see what the report shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1582)|
| 0:26:31| With regard to the other comment that Mr. Woodhull and Mr. Thomas made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| can't we put a little clause on that sentence that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| a candidate who receives a contribution in excess of $50 or some number different than the state number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| if you prefer it to be a lesser amount, shall also list the occupation and employer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| In other words, can we put a ceiling maybe a little more modest than the state one, if you feel that's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| so that you get it and avoid that problem of someone who's just trying to give $10 or $15 or $20 to a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| because they know them, they like them, but, you know, they don't want to get involved in a whole big disclosure form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| That seems like it might be a reasonable compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I don't know whether Ms. Palmer would accept that as a suggestion or not, but that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| And if I missed this, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| But I wanted to just ask again if, in your professional opinion, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| when you look around other cities, Mr. McKay, is this more consistent or less consistent with what other cities do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1648)|
| 0:27:38| This, what you have in place right now is the most open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| and transparent financial disclosures I've ever seen in the whole country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| You're required to disclose every penny that you take in and every penny that you spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| So you just can't get any better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Can't get any better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| So that's your professional opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| So I hope you don't mess with that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| But, you know, all we're really asking for is to know what date is due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| and to have an ending date when the period ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Because the way it is now, if you're walking up to the Election Commission with a report that's due on, say, the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| if someone hands you a check, you know, do you put that on that report or we don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| So those are the only two things we're really hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| And I hope as a citizen that you don't take away the full disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I have had some phone calls about this from various people who supported certainly the spirit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1710)|
| 0:28:39| Councilman Delavaux did suggest that maybe between 50 and 59 might be an appropriate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| My big concern is that we don't have a few people trying to manipulate the outcome of our elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| So I think probably I'm sensing that we are all in agreement about the date part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| We can all pretty much accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And what we're quibbling about now is how much of a disclosure is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| We do live in a time when we value openness and nothing being going, hiding behind the rug, under the door, in the pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1743)|
| 0:29:13| I've heard tales, I've taught students about times when candidates for office would go into a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| and have on an overcoat and they would leave and their pockets were so full of money they couldn't hardly get out of the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| Well, generally most of us don't take cash contributions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| We pretty much like those checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| So that part of it has eased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| But I do have a concern that at the local level we would have a concern about the openness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| if we don't have some better disclosure than $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Well, I think Mr. McKay summed it up best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| I mean, we have got a great system in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| And what we're trying to do is tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| So, you know, I hear what Councilman DelVolpe is saying about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| if 90 days is too long, then 60 days, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| But I still think that there's enough confusion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Or not confusion, but there's still, I don't think we all agree on everything in this, how it's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| So, you know, I think it's worth a workshop to be able to discuss it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| There are, you know, again, we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| The state doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| We've got a great one in place, according to Mr. McKay, the best in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| So if people start reporting, I don't even know when the first reporting date is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| And I don't even know who's actually filed their petitions and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| It doesn't start until a candidate files a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| And nobody's done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Well, so, I mean, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| So, I mean, we've got a little bit of time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| But I'll listen to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Yes, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| The last time we had this on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Councilman Pavlis had presented some possible amendments in a table format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| to streamline a little bit the reporting schedule when there were city deadlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| that were very close to the state disclosure deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Is that still on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Is that one of the things that you're addressing, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| I mean, but again, after thinking about that, I think a workshop would be a time to really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| to where the public, I mean, have people say, well, I saw you handing it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| but I didn't see what everybody else got to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| And then that workshop and what have you, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| the press could have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And so, I mean, that's another reason to postpone this and have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| It's on the table, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| I guess the other half of my statement is I do think as a candidate in this year's election cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| and knowing that there are other candidates out there, it would be really nice to have this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Because as Mr. McKay said, there is confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| And those of you that ran just recently experienced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| And as a candidate, you want to comply fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| But when you call the Election Commission and they're not really sure what it is either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| then that's certainly not where we want to be as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| So I guess I would almost lean in favor of passing this tonight so that we have something to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| And then if we need to have a workshop and tweak it further, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| I know that that's awkward to change it twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| but it's not like an amendment to the charter that goes forward with all of those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| And certainly we could amend it again if we felt like we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| But at least we would, as petitions start to be filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| we would have a template that's more clear than where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Vice Mayor Bailey, let me ask, do you think we could have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| This is April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I was going to ask, I know we've got one on the 14th and then we have one on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| And I'm not sure after that we have budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| Would it be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| We've got budgets coming up, but I don't know if it would be possible to add that to one of our workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| I'm just throwing that out to ask, what did you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| And I'm not sure how long this one on the 14th will last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| The 28th is the ridgetop hillside slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| You know, that's probably going to be a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| But we've combined them before, so that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| Well, Council Member Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Well, I echo Councilwoman Roddy's concern that we are getting closer to the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| One mayoral candidate has submitted petitions, and there will be others, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| as people jockey, council members and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| And I'm concerned that if we postpone this and have a workshop, that there will be confusion continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| When I ran for office, I called the law department and I called the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| and no one could really give me a firm date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| So I just kind of thought, well, the state has these dates, so I'll just do it X amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| The ordinance says it is written, says the 7th of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| and I know that sometimes that really is close to the state filing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| Another year it might not be as close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| And so part of the reason for picking a day in the month was that the last day of the preceding month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| would be the end of the collection of money, and then the report would be due seven days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| And so that was essentially, and I had talked with Mr. McKay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| we talked with Scott Frith about the length of time with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| because we had bantered about different days and seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| particularly since most people keep their reporting and counting things electronically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| that it would not be as big of a hardship on the candidate as it might first appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| It would not be cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Council Lady Palmer, if we could go ahead and possibly approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| with the elimination of the last paragraph under the monthly disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| I think that what I'm hearing is that some of us have a little heartburn over that part, which let me read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| In addition, if the contribution is from an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| a candidate must also list the occupation and employer of the contributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| A candidate who makes good faith, that can stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| But maybe that's the sentence that some of us are having a bit of a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| And if we could go ahead and approve this with eliminating that, I think maybe we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| and then still plan to have a workshop and work those other things out, as Councilman Pavlis is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Would you consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Well, are you talking about the post-election disclosure, number two on page three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| Monthly disclosure on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Repeat what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| The last two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| If you would consider, you know, withholding that, then I think that we could go ahead and pass the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| and then plan on a workshop at an appropriate time and deal with a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| In other words, solve the date problem and leave the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Yes. It seems like the date problem is the big thing for the candidates now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| And if we could go ahead and solve that, then that will help those candidates that are running at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| Then we can go back and have further discussions on is it $50, $100, $500, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| But in order to move this along and in order to get it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| I would be amenable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| But I do want us to have a workshop to look at anything else we need to do to tweak this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| But I do think that in the interest of the election that's rapidly coming down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| that we do need to move forward, at least with the dates part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| So I would accept that kind of an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Mr. Swanson, we don't have to go back to ground zero, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| If we amended this to remove the disclosure with the part about reporting your occupation employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| we would not have to go back to ground zero and start over, would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| You'll get those two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I guess the question is, is that a substantive change to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| I find it hard to give you an opinion that it is not a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| I think it would send you back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Now, you could amend it to make it emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| If you want to do it tonight, you can amend it to delete those three sentences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| and then further amend it to make it to adopt it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| And that would take care of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Otherwise, I think it goes back to first reading with that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Mr. Mayor, with your permission, I would like to amend it as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| What Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| What you would like to do is move to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Let me recognize Vice Mayor Bailey before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| I'd just like to say I appreciate this effort for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And I'm not sure exactly what the specific concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| or what we would hope to accomplish in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| And I said that two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| I'm for full disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| I'm for tightening up all these dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| And unless I can hear what we would hope to accomplish specifically, what our goals would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| then I'm more apt to vote for this as it currently stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| And in addition to that, I'm also in support of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| And I would personally be amenable to two workshops on the 14th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| because I don't think the one we currently have scheduled is going to last that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| And I think I don't know how long this one we're talking about here would go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So that's where I stand, and I'll listen to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| I think it would be good to add the workshop to one of our existing workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| Therefore, we could clear it up before the vote is taken and people have to turn in by June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| But I guess we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| Mr. Mayor, for clarification, I've heard two different deletions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| and it strikes me that only the last two sentences of the monthly disclosure ought to be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| The one before that mimics the existing law, which it gives the amount and that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| the address of the contributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| That's all in the current law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| So I'm asking Mr. Swanson if we can just focus on those last two sentences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| which deal with the amount we want to take up at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| An amendment would be in order to delete the last two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Similarly, an amendment would be in order to delete the last three sentences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| ever how you decide you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Well, what I'm suggesting is that taking out the third sentence from the bottom actually might change the current law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| in a negative way, identifying the person, their address, and that kind of thing, the dollar amount, is what's required now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| And we shouldn't take that out of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| You're asking me a policy question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| You know how I feel about policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Well, I'm suggesting that we, Ms. Palmer, that we deal with the last two sentences at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| and leave the rest of this proposal intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| That's what I was amenable to was the last two sentences and no other sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| That helps me understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| I would like to either amend that we eliminate the last two sentences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| or second Council Lady Palmer's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| I've got a second over here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| So to eliminate the last two sentences under the monthly disclosure number one on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2449)|
| 0:40:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| I'm actually, if I could ask for a little clarification, I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| Are we in the process of amending it to delete those last two sentences of that particular section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| and then going to amend it to make it pass on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Or are you going to let it go back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Going to make it emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| That would be two different amendments, but let's do those one at a time just so everybody will understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| So the motion on the floor right now is to amend it by deleting the last two sentences of the monthly disclosures subsection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2492)|
| 0:41:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| I think everyone is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Now amendment number two will be to move to amend this to make this an emergency measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Do we want to have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Do we want to piggyback the one on the 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Well, let's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| What's the will of the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Maybe I can take the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Well, let us get this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Let's get it voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Didn't we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Yes, I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Not the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| On emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| One more vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Voted on the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| We are on the ordinance as amended two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| Then we'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Now, can I get a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Now, Councilman Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| What's the will of the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Would you like to have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| And if so, would you like to piggyback on the one on the 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| First question is, do we want to have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=2587)|

| 0:51:01| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| You're saying any member can bring it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3063)|

| 0:51:09| Actually, I was going to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I'd received some correspondence from constituents about whether we should be declaring something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| historic or, you know, long-standing as a landmark with a low time period, like 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| years, so the 50-year period is acceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3087)|

| 0:51:30| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| The way I understand it, we've got two areas of signs we want to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| One's a landmark, and then the other one's a historic sign, and I believe there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| criteria for deciding which qualifies as each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| Each one has a 25-year time period in it at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| The correspondence I got was mainly about the historic sign, so I think it's, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| necessarily suggesting this, but I think there's a possibility you could leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| 25-year in for a landmark sign and amend the 50-year for a historic sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| I don't know if we want to do that or not, but that might give a little leeway for signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| that were creative, had an identity with the neighborhood, but didn't necessarily have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| There would still be at least four out of seven criteria that would have to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3146)|
| 0:52:37| even if it had more than 25 years, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| The correspondence I got basically was just addressing the historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| That's what I was addressing was historic, and you're saying the landmark could be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| different term, length of term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| If I understand Mr. Pavlis's comment, he wanted to amend both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| And I'm not necessarily saying that's wrong, but there is a distinction, I think, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| you could possibly amend one and then leave a little more leeway in the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| I'm open to it for comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3189)|

| 0:53:13| Counselman Delavaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Yes, I wonder if we could consult with Mr. Donaldson on the rationale for MPC to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| that term, 25 years, and whether there's any difference in your mind between landmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| signs and historic signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you, Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| We received correspondence from the city administration kicking off this process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| with it a copy of the ordinance from the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, that was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| in 2010 with a request that we try to use that as much as possible as a guideline, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| in that ordinance, the period of time is 25 years, and other designation criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3229)|
| 0:53:58| we also adopted, and the primary difference in the landmark versus historic sign is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| A historic sign is one that can be moved off premises, whereas a landmark sign is a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| that can be renovated and moved on the same piece of property, so they are essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| both historic signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Is a historic sign the JFG type sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| What's the distinction in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| The current JFG sign that was moved off of the property at the end of Gay Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| and is looking for an alternative place to be erected would be an historic sign because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| it will be moved from one property to another and essentially will serve as an off-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| advertising sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| As opposed to one that says, like, welcome to North Hills or some other type landmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| that's saying you're in a specific place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| No, as opposed to another JFG sign, which is on top of a building in the old city, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| during that redevelopment of that building they needed to move that sign from one part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| of the building to another part of the building, they could do that with landmark sign designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3314)|
| 0:55:22| keeping that sign on the same piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| All right, summing up, if you leave the Charlotte designation out of the picture, that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Is there any length of time that you think is appropriate or inappropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| In other words, is there some specific length of time that makes sense regardless of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| Charlotte did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| In my opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| We've moved beyond Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| We're now in the greater Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| We typically use 50 years for buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| It could be argued, and I suspect that it was in establishing 25 years as the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| the life of a sign is much shorter, usually much shorter than the life of a building because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| it usually is tied to a business, and business life can be very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| And the multiple generations of signs probably occur much more rapidly than multiple generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| That would be ... So that was a discussion, do you think 25 is a good number, do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| a higher number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| It could be from when cities started to do this, it could have been 10 to 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| ago, and they were looking at a set of signs that were immediately after World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| and 50 years would not have captured them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| There could have been any number of rationale for picking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| We're back to you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Yeah, if I could, I just wanted to clarify, I'm totally for raising it to 50 years on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| the historical signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| My only question, the only reason I raise this is because there's another criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| for landmark signs, and I was wondering if there was any value in leaving the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| for a landmark sign, which is a little bit different, and you might have a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| of leeway in that because it talks about signs that ... Outstanding example of a sign maker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| art due to craftsmanship, et cetera, and I wondered if in the landmark signs we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| want to leave a more lenient time period, but I'm just throwing this out because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| was confused about the two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I'm totally for raising it to 50 years on the historical signs, so I want to hear comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| from fellow council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| I think one thing that we ought to look at is to try to keep this as simple as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and if you read what they say a landmark sign is, it says the purpose of designating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| a sign as a landmark sign is to encourage the restoration and retention of on-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| non-conforming signs that are historically significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| It talks about even landmark signs being historically significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And then also the other thing when it talks about, of course it talks about the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| signs, but the other thing that I think we need to consider is how we go about making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| sure that we have the designation of a landmark sign or a historic sign and how the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| of that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| And what this does say, it says that the building official shall have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| to approve or disapprove the designation of an existing sign as a landmark or a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| sign based upon the criteria stated above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| To me it makes a lot of sense that we keep the 50 years in for all signs, because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| you think about it, we're really looking for 25 years, we're looking at a sign that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| was what, built in 1986?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| And so then you begin to border on different types of signs, and I think that in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| to keep this simple, and also to go back with the intent that a number of organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| that both Nick and I talked to is that that's what we had talked about was 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| So I think that we should stay with 50 years for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| If a sign comes up, if there's a landmark sign out there or a historic sign that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| less than 50 years, you still have the variance process that you can go through in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| So that would take care of that particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| So I think that we ought to amend it that in both situations where Nick had recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| that we change the 25 years to 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| Councilman Pavlis, I think your amendment does that, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| That's exactly right, that's what I'm asking for it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| And I think Councilman Grieve, it's on a, you know, a very important point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| I mean, there's nothing being more contentious, I don't think, before this council, or it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| at least top two or three other than signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| And there's, you know, we've, not that we're bound by any special interest groups, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| will, but they're very important groups to non-historical preservation and one heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| But, you know, they're before us, you know, on quite a few issues and, you know, we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| you know, they found common ground in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| And I think that that's very important that we listen to that constituency and those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| and, you know, both those groups are scenic Knoxville and Knox Heritage are comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| with this and I'm comfortable with moving it forward and that's why I made the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| and I certainly hope that my members on this council will concur with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| And I did second his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| And I'm okay with that, you know, and I was always for strengthening the historical protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| on both of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| It was, I just wanted some clarification because there was a landmark and a historical aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| and they had slightly different criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So thank you for addressing the problems, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| Councilman Grieve, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| All the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| I think we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| And two amendments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| We need to vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Does anybody want to vote on the amendments separately or is everybody comfortable with both amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| Comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| We'll vote on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3699)|

| 1:02:25| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| I was wondering, did we need to, was there a sense of urgency here on this that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| going to need to make the motion to amend to pass it on emergency or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3750)|

| 1:02:37| On, are you speaking of what's before us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| That we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Oh, what we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I know there was, we needed to move on it, and I didn't know if we needed to pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| on emergency or not, but apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Let's ask Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Is anybody aware of emergency that we don't have time for two votes on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| No emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3785)|

| 1:05:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| We're moving to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| We're going to move to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| I'd just like to recognize Rick Emmett, who wants to make a brief statement on redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3928)|

| 1:05:40| Two people who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| Thanks, Chairman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| I'm Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I'm the downtown coordinator for the city, sometimes urban growth manager, and sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| census coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| We have come up with a redistricting plan that I think may work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| We emailed that to everyone this week, and I know you just barely have it, so I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| what I'm hoping is that we'll have a public hearing or something on this at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| where I can go into more depth with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| But this plan that I've developed, and you all have now, and I've got a poster of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| in the back, by the way, which I'm going to give it to city council for their office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| at the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| It's got three main components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| The first one is that it's got an 8% variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| If you recall from our workshop, 10% was the criteria, so it fits that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| We're only moving 11,000 people, and our minority count stays at 58%, which is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| So it meets all of our major criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Just a very minor changes, so I think it looks to me like a pretty good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| And all the data will be on the websites as of tomorrow on the city's website, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| election commission's website, the NPC's website, all the data, the map of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| and everything that goes with it for the public to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you for your work and expertise on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| We have Clark Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| If you'd come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| I'm Clark Hamilton, 1200 Stalewell Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| Zip is 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Recently I read a couple of articles in the Knoxville News-Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| I was talking, addressed the State Street Garage expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| I can remember years ago an architect and engineer had come back to city council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| had recommended, I don't remember the exact figures, but somewhere between 350,000 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| 450,000, adding some additional reinforcements so this structure, the facility, could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| added on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| They talked at that time about additional levels to the State Street Garage and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| the potential for maybe a small office building or an elderly type tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| The city has been able to recruit their investment by selling air rights above this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| One of the things, though, I have concerns about is that it is mentioned about the facility being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| expanded in maybe two different construction phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| I think it would be prudent to do only one phase because you're going to certainly disrupt the traffic out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| building, whether you build one level or four levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| The cranes and the flatbed trucks bringing the precast concrete panels, assuming it's a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| The other thing it has a concern about, during this construction phase, we have a loss of income to that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| Also, I think it will have an impact on the downtown area, the theater district, the busy theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| The other thing I would recommend is that Mayor Brown take a look at is that is there a potential maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| waiting until such time we get the Hanley Street bridge completed because State Street will be a very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4122)|
| 1:08:50| north and south corridor while the construction of that facility is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| You've got two gentlemen here that I think you probably should consult in regards to the impact of the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| To my right is Mr. King of the city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| I think he can relate to you what the impact would be to the construction, to the traffic impact to the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| And then Mr. Greave, an experienced architect, I think can also bring to the table the impact it would have upon the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4151)|
| 1:09:19| While we're constructing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Now we have James McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| If you'd come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4168)|
| 1:09:36| James McMillan, 4715 McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| I'd like to hand out, give a handout here to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| I brought some pictures dealing with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| I've come here many years ago to bring the same issue I'm bringing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| We have basically a new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Everyone here has run over stronger neighborhoods and healthier neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| How can our neighborhoods be stronger and healthier when they're at risk of being flooded every time it rains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| So, like I say, I'd like to get a handout here for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4215)|
| 1:10:38| Well, if everybody's got one, we have historic flooding, as everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| I'm sure all of your phones have been lit up by people griping, people complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| All of this done on a two-year rain event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| And the first picture was taken four days after the rain event at a place I know very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4255)|
| 1:11:04| This is where First Creek and White's Creek come together, down right beside a 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4264)|
| 1:11:12| As the picture shows, White's Creek is muddy as it can be four days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| First Creek is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| The water coming into the city can violate your permit, causing the city a fine up to $10,000 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4281)|
| 1:11:30| And, like I said, these captions and stuff show what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| Photo number two was taken on my property up in White's Creek about a half a mile before it flows into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4296)|
| 1:11:45| You can see the level of the flow still at almost the bank levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| The third picture shows it at McCampbell Drive to where you can see really the quality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| All of this coming from one Knox County site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| I believe all the old council members remember the stormwater fight that was done here years ago that I brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4323)|
| 1:12:14| asking for help to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| As you can see, little enforcement is ever done in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4337)|
| 1:12:25| The fourth photo shows a county stormwater pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| As you can see, it's a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| This is where we have to control flow and where we're supposed to catch sediment at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| As you can see, there's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| This is one of the ponds where the mud is coming from, from this one county site four days later doing all the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4363)|
| 1:12:53| Photo number five shows a sinkhole that is below this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| where this outfall, number four, drains to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| Mr. King can tell you, y'all have had many problems, you know, with sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| Harold Hills, over here around the park, and even back in the other fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| The county was supposed to adopt standards as equal as the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| The city, I try not to talk technical because it goes over everybody's heads and their eyes glass over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| but Mr. King and his staff in their 1,300 pages of land developmental manual and other things, section 88 of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| areas draining to a sinkhole, you cannot increase the flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| As you can tell, the county's pond doesn't catch anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| And also, there is a loophole in the city stuff, policy 12, to where they can slow their water back six times as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4429)|
| 1:13:57| But as you can tell, in the county, it's still wide open as it was when I was up here six years ago speaking to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| And the point of showing you this is all of this gathers up and floods the city out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| to the city taxpayers that pay city taxes and county taxes that are getting killed down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4454)|
| 1:14:22| This is why we're having 100-year flood events at a two-year rain event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4462)|
| 1:14:30| And the problems still exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| Photo number six shows another pond or another sinkhole that doesn't even have a pond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| It's a straight pipe, just bam, wham, thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| You know, just off my property where I can get a few more houses in because I have to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4485)|
| 1:14:53| This county site is up here off of Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4493)|
| 1:15:02| The developer of this will be begging you all not to adopt the hillside regulations because it's just too costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4502)|
| 1:15:14| And as you can see in the county, it doesn't matter what regulations we get, what agreements we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| without any enforcement of the laws that are in place right now, there's nothing to minimize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| or mitigate the damage that my property and everybody's property is getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| And just to be fair, the next picture shows some bad city sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| I document a lot of sites out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| And as you can see, their pond is dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| You can see mud everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| This is out on N. Skip Road, I think in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| Photo number eight is another pond at the same site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| I've been out here as little as two hours, two-and-a-half hours after a two-inch rain event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| It's dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| We're not slowing nothing down on a few sites in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Photo number nine is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Photo number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Mr. McMillan, your five minutes are now up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| I would be willing to extend and give him time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| The other photos are still two more city sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| What I'm doing here, I'm a county resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| I have a lot of friends that live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| But this legislative body has a responsibility to its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| When they know things are not being done right, they need to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| That is what I'm asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| As a lot of you know, without these laws being enforced, this is what happens on a two-year rain event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4614)|
| 1:17:06| And the county, as I showed, is wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| And I hate to get on the city, but the city's hands are not lily-white either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| These laws were put in place for the public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| I would like a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| This is a public health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| This is what our grandkids are going to have to pay to fix that could be done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4649)|
| 1:17:37| And, again, I ask for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| I will meet with any of you all to drive you around anywhere in the county or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| And try to solve this problem before the floodwaters completely cover all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| And, again, I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| Anything I can do to help any of you all, I would meet, drive you around, show you the problems, the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| Are we going to bankrupt ourselves by not enforcing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Before you leave, I have two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| And I hope you'll respect that I don't really want a long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| You mentioned around photograph five and the ones that preceded that, that there was one particular county site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| I didn't get the reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| So what's the county site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| So don't make it a mystery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Well, all of the mud, all that muddy water is coming from one Knox County site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| It's Shannon Valley Farms, done by Rocky Smith, Smith Belt, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| The second question is you had those pictures, eight, nine, ten, eleven, the empty retention ponds or detention ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4730)|
| 1:19:00| whatever you call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| In the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Yeah, in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| What do you say happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| They were put in the wrong place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Why are they empty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Well, it's as simple as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| You cannot have an empty pond during the construction phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| This is a violation of state and federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| When you let all the water flush out, all the mud goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| It's a water quality issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| The thing is not hooked up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Well, they've got holes in the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| This is the same issue we had years ago, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| During the construction phase, we've got to have water in there to filter water and slowly release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| Some of these ponds, like I say, they can never go dry during the construction phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| unless we don't have rain for two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| I just wanted to understand what you were saying about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Well, if there's no further business to come before this council, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Thank you, everyone, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110405?start=4802)|
