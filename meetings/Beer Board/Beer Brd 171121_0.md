| 0:03:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Okay. Because the owner has not been in for the background records check, we do not approve these until that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| So I'm going to move that we move this to the December 19th meeting, and hopefully he can get down and get that taken care of by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=217)|

| 0:07:03| I believe that we need to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=425)|

| 0:07:15| I just wanted to note here, this is a kiosk in the middle of the food court at Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| There are obviously a number of questions that one might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| For example, why couldn't I go up and get a beer and then walk around the mall and share it with my underage friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| So I believe that that is all being worked out now between the law department and the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Next month, the four of you who will be back perhaps need to be very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| The five of us who won't be back won't be aware or worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Madam Chair, is this your last beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=472)|

| 0:07:58| Get over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| I may be at full-blown tears by the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| You can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=485)|

| 0:10:02| It's all different kinds of chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| You want it hot, they can make it hot for you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| After a few bourbons, you won't realize that anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| That will cause you to drink more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| When do you think you're really going to get this open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=613)|

| 0:13:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=790)|

| 0:13:33| If we can get 90 days, we'd take 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Are you going to be open by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| We're looking at a 90-day build-out from the time we get our permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| If everything went right, we would have been open April, the end of April last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| But everything hasn't gone right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| So now we're looking at probably toward the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| That's why I bring this up, because we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| More than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| They won't actually open until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Yeah, if we need to go back through the process, we'll go back through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| What does the beer board want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| What's the pleasure of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Can we do the 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Whose district is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| And have him come back in 90 days and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Or just keep it pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Just, you know, postpone the completion date for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| That would be the end of February, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=866)|

| 0:14:28| The end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| It's actually the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| The hope is that you open in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=874)|

| 0:14:43| Make a motion to postpone it until the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=883)|

| 0:14:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| It's actually an extension rather than a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=898)|

| 0:16:47| The renovation is still ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1007)|

| 0:18:21| I'm looking at the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| You've submitted a remedial plan and paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Why was there a second violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| It's just a person kind of didn't follow the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| What's the procedure if I come in and I want to buy something at your market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Tell me how you check my ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| We try to check the ID by asking the customer's ID, enter the birth date on the computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Do you have an electronic system to enter the birth date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| No, just manually, but we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| But you do now have an electronic system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Oh, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| If I'm under 21, is there anything on my license that helps you know that I'm that age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1140)|
| 0:19:10| Usually there is a stripe next to your picture that says you're under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| Is there any color marking on the license that shows that I'm under age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| We just check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| There is a red line around the person's birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| And you should immediately look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| If you see that, you ought to know that they're under age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Yes, that's what I mean by the red lining next to their picture, which tells you if they're under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Beer Board, any further action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Are we going to let them ride?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| It's a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Does the computer system read that little thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Is it on the back now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| It just reads it automatically, digitally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| It does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1201)|

| 0:20:34| Arshad Rajani, 2561 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| And you were cited for sale on September 20, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| You paid your fine and submitted a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Same question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| How do you know that just by looking at my license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Well, as you said, there is a red line that says you are under 21st until 2018 or 2019, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| So do you check those all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Well, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Here's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Actually, my cashier, he got excited because somebody told him that he sold a $50,000 winning ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| And every time you scan a beer, whenever you scan a beer, there's a software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| We have a back office software, so you have to press default in order to proceed further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| And somebody told him that, and he just started defaulting it, and that's how he got cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Well, that's not ever going to happen again, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| We actually ordered an online system, like online scanner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| so every cashier has to scan the state ID in order to proceed further now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Any further action from the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Well, did he win the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Actually, we find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| He bought it from the pilot across the street for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Is he now working at the pilot across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| No, he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| He's still working over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| He's working with us, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1321)|

| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Next is Zoe's Restaurants, and this is the location on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| And just briefly, they have been cited, finally got their plan in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| They paid their fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| They were cited again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| They paid their fine, got their plan in, and then TABC finally got everything through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| So you have been you have a TAB suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| TABC suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| The TABC suspension is five days, and it's currently being served this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Is there any fine involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| It was either a $5,000 fine or a five-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| And what about from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| We're still trying to resolve an agreed order on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| So do we want to not take any further action pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| What did they do to remediate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Pull your microphone down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| What did they do to avoid this happening a third time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| We filed the revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| It was filed about a few days too late before the previous beer board hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1401)|
| 0:23:31| In that plan, it's detailed steps that have been enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Zoe's retained the services of Kim Pouncey at Top Shelf EDU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| and she helped create this revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So Top Shelf is helping them get a good plan in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| We submitted that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| And are they helping train the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| The employees of Zoe's are taking the Top Shelf EDU course or quiz or test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| So we shouldn't see them again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Hopefully not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| So no further action from the beer board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| There is any business for the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1448)|

| 0:24:12| We skipped one or two, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Yeah, we passed two of them that we called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| and they didn't show at the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1459)|

| 0:24:21| Is anybody here from Fork Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Well, I guess we could continue this until December 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Yay or nay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1469)|

| 0:24:49| Do I hear a motion to extend to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| I move to extend that to December 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1491)|

| 0:25:02| We do notify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| We don't have a valid address for Geezers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1503)|

| 0:25:09| it comes back unclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Are they still going to open a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Yeah, we have no contact with them because they are not receiving our correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| It's a problem with old people, these Geezers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Does anyone have any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171121?start=1522)|
