| 0:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=180)|
| 0:03:13| To order, does any commissioner have anything they need to add or take off the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=193)|
| 0:03:22| Scott, can you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| I've got something coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=207)|
| 0:03:37| We have one from Public Works, a resolution approving a contract with Progression Electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=217)|
| 0:03:47| for traffic signal maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| Is there any opposition or anything about adding this to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=233)|
| 0:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| It's been added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=243)|
| 0:04:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I need to add two things for the educational consent agenda that for some reason didn't make it to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| The term bid agreement for mowing services for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| agreement for miscellaneous construction services, as well as acoustical tile installation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| We'll add those three to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| Are you going to send us the request for legislative action to the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| I asked if there was anything I needed to fill out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| When I went up there a few minutes ago, they said there was none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| If there's something I need to fill out, I'll be more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| Yeah, if you'll just see them after or you can go upstairs up there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Yeah, I'd like to ask number 25, which has been considered by Commissioner Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| asking the Knox County Department of Finance to examine the county retirement investment funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| The finance department has nothing to do with the pension board funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| So I'm requesting Commissioner Harmon to ask the pension board, by letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| for us to investigate the investments in sedan and any other questions anybody might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| Therefore, I'd like to have that removed and have him go through the proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Would Mr. Chairman do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| You know, under your rules, you know, any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=344)|
| 0:05:54| We have to take it off the finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| You'll probably need to take it off the finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| You can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Okay, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| The law director is saying we have to wait until the committee to take anything off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Okay, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| I've got a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| I'm trying to give it to all the commissioners that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| And any of those that come in later, I'll give them one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| But it's addressed to Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| You want an outlaw poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| And Commissioner Smith has one to add an ordinance of the commission of Knox County adopting a telephone poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| letter ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| You can go ahead and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| What it is, it's businesses on telephone polls that are operating without permits or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| It's a form of litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| You know, remove your rude sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I'm not talking about yard signs and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| You hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Why don't you move it closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Pull the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Okay, so this is advertisement stakeholder telephone polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| They stay permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| I was about to panic there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| I thought you were wanting outlaw polling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| And I was going to say, how are we going to know what people think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| Larry, have you checked to see if it's already allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Yeah, we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| I mean, we already have a provision in our code that addresses this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| It's not as specific as this ordinance is, but it covers the same subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| But we were asked to draft an ordinance specifically for the telephone polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| And so that's what you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| Let me ask, does that need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| We're going to have to get your mic fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| Does that need to be put where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| I mean, somebody's having a yard sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| They put it and they take that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Or the rain is going to dissolve the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| These people that are putting it, we need to be more specific in what we're looking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| People that put these plastic signs or whatever or business signs up wanting to paint your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| or put metal roofing things down, how can we be specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| I don't want to put somebody that's having a yard sign and charge them $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| It's a matter of this being, I think it's a matter of this being brought to the attention of our codes folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| Bruce, the ordinance that we have in place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| does it sufficiently cover this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| It does to the extent that all signs are placed in the county road right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| They're technically not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| That goes for real estate signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| That goes for the signs that Commissioner Smith is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| I think the fine for that, though, is probably only $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| One of the provisions in talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Isn't it 50 up to 1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Isn't it 50 to 1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| You know, I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| I think there's been some discussion about that because of state laws and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Obviously, you would know more on that than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| The thing that we wanted to try to reinforce is that we were able to go against whoever's advertised on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| Because our misdemeanor citation generally requires that we actually witness the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| which means seeing a person put the sign out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| So it would be helpful to be able to say, you know, if I'm Toys R Us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| then I can go out there and cite the manager of Toys R Us if they're putting out a bunch of signs in the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I'm not talking about right of ways because, I mean, that's a whole different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| I'm talking about just telephone poles, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| We won't look at right of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| That's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| But I'm just looking at the telephone poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| We've talked to the attorney general, and they haven't expressed, you know, any major concern with prosecuting a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| who's been cited under the ordinance, under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| I mean, they're pretty heavy out in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| I've driven up and down Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| And they've been up there for months and months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| You know, nobody's doing anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| And it's just sort of gone to sleep with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Bruce, before you leave, we've had some calls down in the 4th District about the underground fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| We essentially are dealing with what's the best way to characterize it is an illegal demolition landfill out on Tedford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| It's not far from where Travis Marine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| In fact, the county's got a couple crews out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| This dump is caught on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| What they've done is brought in logs, brush, mostly construction materials such as reinforced concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| They've been piling this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| And somehow it's combusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| It's up underneath where it's been filled over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| So what we're having to do is uncover this and extinguish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| It's now burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| It's essentially burning in the very front of it, nearest Tedford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| There's a bunch of logs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| The challenge that we're having is because this is all filled material, there's working equipment in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| and doing it in a safe manner, uncovering this material and trying to extinguish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| What our net goal here is, is obviously to get the fire out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| That's the primary concern, not only because of carbon monoxide levels, but it smells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| It's not like a wood fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| It smells bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| You can sniff the inside of my car if you want to do that some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| But after we do that, then what we need to do is really go back and assess whether this entire landfill needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| to be removed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And that needs to be done through TDEC and the EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| We're looking at a mammoth operation if we're going to have to remove all this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| But we're currently trying to get this fire out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Rural Metro has been very helpful in assisting us out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And we're going to keep at it until we get this thing under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| You've got all the stuff you need to take care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| And we did, we, the county did incur some significant expense around New Year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| We had to bring in an outside contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| I think Mr. Venedate may have sent you all an e-mail or posted you on what we had to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| We were in a situation that our personnel could not operate in that environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| because of the high carbon monoxide levels requires hazmat materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| So we brought in HEPACO out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| They're about $1,000 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| They were out there for three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| So I'm expecting a very hefty bill to come our way in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Certainly, we are going to pursue recovering our funds from the property owners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| But we felt like the county needed to step up and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| We had people evacuated out of their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| So we did the only thing we needed to do was to go and assist Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Bruce, do we know who the property owners are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| It's a Mr. I think it's Woodby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| But we do know the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| In fact, his house is right there at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| I mean, is this something that he is involved in or is it something that just some people have been dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| on his property without him knowing or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Based on what we're able to determine, he certainly was allowing people to dump in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| if not even charging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| I don't know that for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| But based on what I looked at, the material that's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| would lead me to believe that he was charging people to dump this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| because there was no real benefit to him to have this stuff in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| He certainly was trying to fill up a ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| We cited him back in 2006 for doing this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Can we not charge him for our expenses then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| That's what we're going to attempt to do, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| Okay, thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Okay, does anybody have anything they'd like to talk about on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| I'd just like to add Tyler Harbor back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| In 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| What happened with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| The investigation of the Tyler Harbor situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I mean, here we have in the Hall Shopper another article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| another article revealing again a $10,000 payment that was made to Tyler Harbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| Seems like he greatly overcharged or was, and, of course, he, according to the column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| he did not instigate the $10,000 price for some mailers so that, you know, basically the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=871)|
| 0:14:42| I'm going to throw you a bone and greatly overpaid him for a mailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| I think we need to know the truth about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| I want Tyler Harbor in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| I want him under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| And I want to see what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| And I want to see what the administration says under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| We have a rotting, festering, dead rat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| And some people on this commission keep wanting to sweep that dead rat under the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| And it's going to stink until we bring it out into the light of day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and find out exactly what happened and who all was involved in what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| And so, once again, I'm asking that we look into doing an investigation of the allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| that Tyler Harbor made in the Hall shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| We know Tyler Harbor was involved in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| He actually ran some campaigns for folks that sit on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| We know that Tyler Harbor worked for the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| And we know that Tyler Harbor was up to some dirty tricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| That's why he was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Now, when he, after he's been gone, he called a reporter and did this big confessional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| And he says, oh, yes, I did everything that I've been accused of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| and I'm going to tell you more than I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Guys, this is the equivalent of if the sheriff's department called a serial killer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| and called a man for murder and then the man said, okay, now I want to confess I'm a serial killer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| and I've killed all these other people and here were some co-conspirators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| Now, if that happened in the sheriff's department, if that happened with a crime like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| we would investigate because Mr. Harbor's crimes were political in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| There seems to be folks that do not want to investigate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| and I think that it needs to be investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| So I'm putting it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| I'm going to send a letter to the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=989)|
| 0:16:40| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| It's not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| We don't vote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| We've never voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| So we're going to need the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1015)|
| 0:17:06| But what's the rule say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Well, the rules don't address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| What's the rule say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Because the agenda committee is made of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Well, the rule say is matters have been added to the agendas of all meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| It just really needs a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| The agenda isn't set or is the agenda already set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| No, the agenda is not set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| And we set it in that particular debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Do we put it on to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| The question is was it already set for the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Was the agenda already set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| It was discussed at the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| What agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| We had a three-hour discussion about it, a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| And then when it came to the full commission, we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Did we vote to add it to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Or did someone fail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Adding it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Was it an add and a fail or was it on it and we just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Mr. Law Director, let me just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I think there's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Well, last time before the regular meeting, Mr. Hammond and some others asked that it be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| This was never voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| So now I'm not an expert on Robert's rules of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| but my understanding is is that since it wasn't voted on, it can be brought back any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| That had it been voted on and voted down, that it would be a year before it could be brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| But since it was removed from the agenda, my understanding is it can be brought back any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| What the rules provide, your rules provide that any regular agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| or similar subject matter that has been acted on by the commission during its regular session may not be placed on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| regular agenda for a period of 90 days without the consenting vote of two-thirds of the members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| There's only one exception to that, and that's a vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| But it was not acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| It was pulled from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Voted withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| There was a motion to withdraw it from the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| which would take it out of the commission's hands by your rule for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1167)|
| 0:19:38| Unless you have two-thirds vote, and you can add it back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| It's not a budget matter, so there's no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| I thought that if that acted on meant that it came up for a vote and was acted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| I thought that when you withdrew something that it was not acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| As I recall it, no, as I recall it, there was a lengthy discussion about the Tyler Harbor matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| Not in the general regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| There was a lengthy discussion in the agenda meeting and in the committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| There was no discussion whatsoever about it during the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| It was just withdrawal, and then it never went before the regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1219)|
| 0:20:29| Mr. Law Director, could you just research that and find out what was taken and if, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| that it needs to wait 90 days and we should wait 90 days or have a two-thirds vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I mean, this has been going on for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Or if it's in his opinion, too, that it's a proper, it's been properly placed on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| then place it on the agenda and we'll deal with it at the committees and regular commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| But if it was, in your opinion, if it falls in the, where it has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1256)|
| 0:21:06| it is something that has come before this commission and would require a two-thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| then it requires a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Well, it was withdrawn before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Well, it was during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| It was withdrawn at the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| It was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| It was discussed at the agenda meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| and then it was withdrawn at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Who wants to pull something in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| As we were setting our agenda at our full commission meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| I think it was a motion to withdraw and it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| So, or was there a motion to add it and it didn't have enough votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| It was, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I can't remember if it was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I put it on in the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| And then we heard about it in the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| In the committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| And everybody said, bring it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| We want to do this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| And then all of a sudden it was pulled in the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| And so I would contend now to my way of thinking that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| I'm not an expert at Robert's rules of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| But to my way of thinking, it was removed from the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| so it was not something that was acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| This is what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| We'll put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Law director, if you research it, and if it's not on there properly, then we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Cannot a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Any member of the commission can put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| It has not been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| If we voted on this, cannot a member a voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Well, I don't know if this is a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| We never voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Anyone on the prevailing side has the right to bring it back to the agenda, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| We don't have two-thirds vote either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| But we don't have to have it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Any member of the commission can place any item on the commission before the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| If Commissioner Lambert wants to place it on here, then I think we let him place it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| If the law director researches it and sees that there was some kind of action taken on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| and it needs to wait 90 days, then we can withdraw it at intergovernmental finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| Just so that I fully understand your request, this time what you wish to investigate is the $10,000 expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| That is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| I want to investigate all of the allegations that Mr. Harbor made in his confessional with Betty Bean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| with the haul shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| There were numerous allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| It's just the $10,000 comes to mind because it's back up in this week's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| Commissioner, that's not new news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| No, it's not new news, but it's something that we have never acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| We have an allegation that has been made that some real serious political dirty tricks took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| and that they were enacted by folks who were on the payroll of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| Now, I don't think it's wise use of taxpayer money to pay a man $10,000 to send out a $2,000 mailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1436)|
| 0:24:06| That's an $8,000 waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And especially while he's on company time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Tyler Harbor's allegations are that his primary job was to conduct political dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| Now, there's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| There's folks that are politicos, that practice politics for a living all over this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| But it is not proper for a person to be on company time where they owe that time to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| yet to be up to their political dirty trickery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| It's on the agenda, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| It would be on the agenda unless the law director finds cause that we need to wait 90 days for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Is there anything else anybody would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| I'd like to just go over a couple of them because I don't understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| 23, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Would you like to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| I guess it's an audit of the pay of the sheriff's department, exempted employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1510)|
| 0:25:25| Where does it say sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| I'm an internal auditor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Go ahead and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| That way the public will know, too, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| requesting that the Knox County internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| with the assistance of the Department of Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| conduct an audit of overtime pay to exempt Knox County employees in every department and elected office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| and report his findings to the Knox County Commission no later than March 31, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Well, I said sheriff's department because that was what was in the newspaper a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| What I was looking at at our 12 o'clock meeting we had last month, we had this stuff that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| We had all these people that received all this overtime and what not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| and that seemed to sort of be some sort of surprise what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| I wanted to look at, to be fair, I want to look at everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Let's look at all offices, see who else does this, and let's see what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| I'm not picking on the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| To me, we've already looked at the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| And if we've picked on them, I want to look at the other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| I mean, take it all of them, judges and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| Richard, would March 31, is that giving you enough time with everything else that you're already involved in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1599)|
| 0:26:50| It would depend on how quickly we were able to get the information back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| And it would, with what we've got going on, that may push it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| You know, if you need more time, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| But, you know, we had this with the shopping days that came up last month, the bonus for salary people came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| You know, some people have got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I don't believe, I'm for promoting people that do a good job, but I think it needs to be in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| Mr. Smith, I don't believe the bonuses came up on the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| I believe Mr. Vanderbate led you to believe those were bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| But I pulled the pay sheets of these people, and it stated on there as overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| And also, I had the U.S. Department of Labor and employment standards here that those people are exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| They are allowed to be paid overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Yeah, that's what we're working with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Well, we have some people here from the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Right here, it actually says that they were paid overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| It's not bonuses, as Mr. Vanderbate led the people to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Go ahead, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Jimmy Jones, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| We feel like this is aimed at us, so we feel like at least we need to clarify our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| We don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| We welcome any audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| We ask you to come audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| We have no problem with audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| We have never had problems with audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| These people were paid overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| We keep talking about bonuses and bonuses and bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| It's not bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I have the director of personnel here maybe to clarify some of this position for you so maybe you'll understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| This is not an attempt to stop any kind of audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I want to repeat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| We welcome any audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| But maybe this will give a little clarity to what you're asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Sheriff, let me jump in here real quick, Judge, before you get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| As far as I'm concerned, and I mentioned this the other night, I think you guys are through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| We've looked at your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| There's more out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| You know, I'm looking at the other departments, not if something else comes up on the sheriff, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| But I'm looking, as I mentioned to you before, at what the other office holder is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| And, again, I say it came up directed at the sheriff's department when it first came up with the Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| And, again, I say to Mr. Walz, please come check anything we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| We'll give you we'll sit down with you and go over anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| As you know, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| We've discussed this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| And we run a very open department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| But we do feel like there needs to be some clarity in what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| So maybe you'll understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| I'm Chief Rodney Bivens with the director of personnel at the sheriff's office and over the corrections division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| And as it's been stated already, I think it was pointed directly at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| And as the director of personnel, we do payroll through my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| And what we, the basis for the way we figure overtime is, is our employees and the way we budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| And Allison can talk a little bit more about that if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| We budget for 2,080 hours per year per employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| That's the way we budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| And these employees turn in a time sheet every week that accounts for, or they turn in biweekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| It counts for 80 hours per biweekly cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| And that's what we pay based upon is that 80 hours per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| And biweekly, 80 hours biweekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Our employees, most employees for the sheriff's office by nature are law enforcement or corrections officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| We do have some employees that are clerical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Based on those guidelines and what I saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| that's the reason that I looked at paying the overtime and suggested the overtime pay for those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| that received overtime pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| When you've got some time, let's you and I get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I want to go over some figures with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| You pay your overtime pay for them twice a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| And the reason for that is that the county commission knows we bring an overtime budget as set per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| of a certain dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| And what we look at is those employees that I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| and other employees personally observe working several hours overtime, numerous hours overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| that we could never pay them with what little bit of money we're paying them back for the overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| That they actually work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Does anybody have any questions for Chief Bivins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Does Allison Rogers want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| I just wanted to introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I'm Allison Rogers, the finance director, in case anyone didn't know who I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| And if you all had any questions for me, I think Rodney did just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Thank you all for coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1911)|
| 0:32:00| See if we can find something out about 28, 29, 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1920)|
| 0:32:12| Just see if we know what's amendment to Section 4 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Yes, if you'll go ahead and read that and that way the audience will know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| Let's start with 28 and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| approving amendments to Section 4 of the Knox County Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| That's deferred from December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| It was put on by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| Mr. Law Director, do you know what that Section 4 is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Section 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| Hold on just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| What item are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Number 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1969)|
| 0:33:00| Yeah, that is somewhat of a rewrite of what we have that's in our code currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| as far as acceptance of gifts and other things of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| You know, right now we have a standard whether a reasonable person would understand that a gift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| was intended to influence a vote, official action, or judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| This is a rewrite of that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| It lays out a number of, it lays out somewhat of a different standard as well as a number of exceptions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2009)|
| 0:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And what's wrong with, I mean, we went through this once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| What was wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Everybody seemed a few months ago want to stay status quo with the ethics policy that we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2030)|
| 0:34:01| I mean, I don't need anybody personally buying me a meal and I don't need to be buying anybody else a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| So I think if you've got an ethics committee but you're going to water down the regulations for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| if you make a $25 meal, does it have a limit on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| I want to say that the limit is 35 in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Commissioner Pinkston may remember, but this was passed by the ethics committee as a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| to the county commission on revising section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Well, just me personally, like I said before, if you have a $35 limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| somebody could take you out to eat 30 days a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| And that could be a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Is there a way we could get this sort of broken down as to maybe some bullet points as to what the highlights of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2088)|
| 0:34:57| are so that it says it's the way it's presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| It is pretty well broken down within the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| They're somewhat self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| I'm kind of surprised you don't have, well, you don't have a copy of that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| I don't have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Yeah, you don't have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| But it was passed by the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| You'll certainly have it in your packets for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Mr. Wild, Director, is there anything in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Because I absolutely believe that we need to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| And I believe that we need to add some common sense to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| For Christmas, some of my close friends are developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| We've been friends for 20 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| We decided not to exchange gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I still bought things for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| We decided not to exchange gifts because we did not want anyone to say when they had something coming before this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2149)|
| 0:35:58| oh, they bought you, you know, a $90 something for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| I think that we need to have something in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| We need some common sense guidelines so that, you know, if somebody wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| if where there's a friendship that has existed for numerous years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| that kind of thing needs to be honored, needs to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Commissioner Lambert, I believe there is a provision that deals with friendships and maybe other relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| But I don't have it in front of me, and I'm sure we'll have a lengthy discussion about it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| Mr. Chairman, do we need to bring in all the Christmas gifts that we've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| Well, I mean, seriously, how long have you and Victor been friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Since MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Since MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| And under this, if, you know, he bought you a $50 Christmas gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Well, the common sense would be it wouldn't fall under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Well, I would think it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| You know, I'd certainly like to see it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| I don't want to be accused of anything improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Well, I think if we're doing business with people and they want to take us out to lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| and buy us a $35 meal, I think I'll buy my own meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Can we move on, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| amending the Knox County charter to prohibit any person who holds an elective office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| or who is a Knox County employee from eligibility to serve in the office of county commission on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2252)|
| 0:37:42| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I wish Mr. Hammond was here so that we could talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| It just seems utterly ridiculous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| First of all, I don't know that it's constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Can you, you know, a person who works for county government is still a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| They can still vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| And I believe they still have a right to run for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| And I believe that the people of their district have a right to choose them if they're the one that they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| And it kind of concerns me that Mr. Hammond brings this up because he served for how many years besides you, Mr. Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| I believe he was elected in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| And here we are in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| So he sat on this commission next to you for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| And now all of a sudden he's and actually was for your father who did an absolutely wonderful job when he was on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2307)|
| 0:38:39| I'm just wondering what his motivation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| And I'll just say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I just wonder whether this is specifically targeted at Lee Trimmel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Because for a number of years people who have worked for county government have also chosen to run for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2328)|
| 0:38:58| In fact, there was a point in time when Mike Arms was on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| At the same time, he was the chief of staff in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| And I think that this just, it just stinks to me because it looks like they've singled out one person that they don't want to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| And I don't know what they're afraid of, why they're so afraid of Mr. Trimmel getting back on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| But it seems like now they're trying everything in the world to try to affect this election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| even to the point of making it illegal for the man to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| And I think that stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And I wish he was here to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| You know, I've attended since we've decided that we are going to attend the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| I've attended every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| And I certainly wish Mr. Hammond and other commissioners would do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| Okay, Mr. Law Director, we're going to do this by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| So it takes two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| And then if it was to pass, when would it go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| If it is not within the ordinance itself of when it takes effect, it takes, like, 15 days after its passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| So you could pass it and basically have it done for the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| So if I recall, this may have been one of those matters that was discussed in the ethics committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| Let me ask you, say if it did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And say if we, it wouldn't be passed before the February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| It's a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| It would have to be voted on in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Oh, it would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| What he's suggesting is that it be placed on the ballot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Well, it says consideration of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| And that's how you go about putting a matter on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| I believe this is also one of the Knox County One Question Group's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2443)|
| 0:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| When does the, when is the next ethics committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| There's not one currently set to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| Well, we never get notification of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Who does the notification out to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| That would be the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Dwight, can you make sure that the commission office gets a schedule of the upcoming ethics committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| We'll work with Dr. Stewart on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| And we'll also copy Ms. Bonavita when we put the notice in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Right now there's not one currently scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| They generally don't, they don't have a regular called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| They don't just meet for the purpose of meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| They have been meeting when complaints have been filed that need to be reviewed by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| So they will call a meeting for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| But they have to give proper notice, five days or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| It's time for you to get something to the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Defending the Knox County charter, establishing a special election should commission be required to make multiple appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| or the appointment of the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| It's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| And this was just kind of for me to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| I understand that multiple appointments, if something like this ever happened again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| at 12, 5 or 10 or 12 members of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| It's multiples, two or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Two or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| But then it says or the appointment of the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| So is he saying if something happened to a county mayor that we have a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Is that out against what the state law says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| It may be different, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| I believe 28 and 30 both are going against the Constitution, aren't they, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| What you have, you know, basically in the wake of the Jordan case is somewhat of a new understanding, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2571)|
| 0:43:02| of what charter county's powers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And so it will come down to whether a special election can occur when there's no provision for it in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2585)|
| 0:43:17| It will be one of those things that will be challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Just on the physical note, an election in this county would probably cost, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| I guess you'd have to have a primary and a general in the mayor's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| I believe last time we've talked about this and we had Greg McKay down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I think he said it was about $250,000 to $275,000 for an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| So to do a primary and a general, so you're talking half a million to $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| For one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Well, it would be multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| No, it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Or the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| So it could be, if it were just, say, the county mayor, then it would be that much money for a single.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| I mean, I might understand it for multiple appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| But it says it doesn't say and the county mayor, but it says or the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| I guess if you're talking, let's say, two county commissioners or more, that would trigger this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| Or if it was just the mayor, it could trigger this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I guess that's what it's trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| And who would serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Would we appoint a mayor until the election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I think our rules state that the chair of commission would serve as an interim mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Until an appointment or a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| It's until an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Until an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| And that person would serve until the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| I guess we'll talk about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| In great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| We don't want that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Mr. Chairman, I know you're, I don't know that we've talked about number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| I had a question about that, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| And if you could read that, Jolene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| In consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| approving the appointment of Mr. Bruce Anderson as the hearing body regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| violations associated with the Knox County Ordinance 05-2-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2717)|
| 0:45:26| Mr. Alldirector, could you tell me what Ordinance 05-2-102 is and what is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| It is our Adult Business Establishment License Ordinance that we just successfully defended in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2733)|
| 0:45:47| The court's ruling, the court ruled in, as to our motion for summary judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| that found in that the ordinance is constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| And so we are about the process of enforcing that ordinance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| The forms are available in the clerk's office for both businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| and employees to obtain their adult oriented business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| In addition to that, what the ordinance does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| it establishes a very speedy hearing for anyone who is denied a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| And as part of that process, I, as the county attorney, represent the county's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| If a person is denied, I represent the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| And, of course, the aggrieved business owner or employee would have their own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| And the statute provides for, I mean, the ordinance provides for a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| This would just be a neutral body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| A neutral person interacting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| One person, but we're calling it a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Well, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| And the ordinance describes it as a hearing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| but we're looking at one person to be the hearing officer, okay, to listen to these appeals, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2822)|
| 0:47:12| And whatever happens there, of course, is taken up in a court of law, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2832)|
| 0:47:22| Who pays Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Knox County will pay Mr. Anderson for his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| What if we're successful in the reasons why they were rejected for one reason or another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| No, it's just part of the cost of enforcing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Knox County will eat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Do we have a contract or we have a set amount we're going to pay somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Generally, what we are paying attorneys now doing outside work where my office may have a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2869)|
| 0:48:00| because we can't represent persons who are sued in their individual capacities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| we're paying $175 an hour to attorneys to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| That is much less than most of the attorneys would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| Why is this coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I would assume that it would be around that same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Why is this coming out of the mayor's office instead of your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| The mayor, under that ordinance, which was passed a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| but under that ordinance, the mayor appoints the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| This body confirms the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| So, law director, is this something that the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| I was just thinking, is this something the beer board could handle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Or is it by the way the ordinance is set up, we have to hire another person to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| By the way the ordinance is set up, it is a mayoral appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Confirmed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| I was just thinking about the money, that if the beer board were allowed to hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| that we could save some money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| But if it's set up that way, we need to do what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| Will we definitely know the dollar amount before we vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| I will put that in the resolution of what the hourly rate will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| And that's what I would look for is, you know, the hourly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| You could also, it's hard to say, you could also put a cap on it as we do with most things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| And, you know, I wouldn't anticipate too many hearings, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| But if there are, then we'll have to look at it again, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| But I would think that we would establish a rate of around 175 an hour for that hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| for the work he or she, whoever it is, performs in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Well, I'd appreciate that if you'd come up with that and also a cap also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| I don't think there should be too many hours involved in a hearing on one of these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| I may be wrong, but we do need to know what we're funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| So I would appreciate you coming back with the hourly rate and the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| It's hard to cap it because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| you never know how many hours is going to be necessary by the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| We could cap the hourly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| You can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| What about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| We could put, you know, an outside limit and if it looks like you're getting close to that, come back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Would that be satisfactory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Is there a term of officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| We're going to have to create one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| And we should do that through the resolution by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| There's no mention of that in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| We're going to be amending the ordinance anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| But, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Well, if you wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Mr. Vanderveet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Do you all know Bruce Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Yes, sir, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| He served as chair of a past charter review committee and he's a local attorney in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| Does he serve on any other Knox County board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| I'll have to check and come back to you at committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| And also, could you see if he has a resume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Does he have experience in adult oriented business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Or at least in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, his practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| I mean, does he know the law in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| I don't know if he has any expertise in that area, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| I'll try to get you a resume and we'll check on his board service as well before full committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| I think if he's, you know, sat as a judge or sat on, you know, some type of been certified as a negotiator, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3107)|
| 0:51:56| something like that I think would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Mr. Anderson, I do think he may have, and I'm speaking a little out of school here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| but I think he may have some experience somewhere along the lines of serving as some sort of administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| And so, I think that was one reason his name came to the top as a possible candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I want to say that Bruce and I went through mediator training together back in about 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| And he, as I understand it, basically mediation is his practice now, most of his practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| He served on the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Does anybody else have anything they'd like to discuss on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| Let me find it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| But I see Doug out there, and he'll probably know which item I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| It has to do with some swap of some property out on McPhee Road at Concord Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| And what exactly is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| Commissioner Guinness is coming from Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| It's item 24, so everybody can follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| I certainly want him to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| But as I'm aware of it, they have proposed a land swap, or not actually a land swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| that they would be giving us 20 acres of land that they have, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| purchased off McPhee Road inside the town of Farragut in exchange for the ability to expand Concord Marina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| which would include some dry stack storage area, as well as expansion of marina facilities in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| So they'd want to be able to have a dry stack, I guess, dry dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| And are they also looking at another wet slip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| As I understand it, too, now, this would all need to be approved by TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| because this would be, again, a change in the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| I know the Campbells, as well as Commissioner Hammond, have discussed this with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| and already had some conversations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| As my understanding, too, there would be a public meeting process to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| And what would we use the 20 acres on McPhee Road for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| It could be future park expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Obviously, in the southwest sector of the county, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| we have a real shortage of ball field type space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| So this piece of land could be used for future ball field expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Have you approached or has anybody been in conversation with, like, Farragut Baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| or CBFO that handles football and softball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| I mean, is that something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| It's, well, again, very much in the conversational stage right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I mean, frankly, I'm waiting for direction both from county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| and through the mayor's office on how to proceed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| And I think before we proceed too far down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| I think the folks out in that area of the county need to know that this is a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| and let them know is that something they think is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| So we may need to schedule some type of public hearing before we go too far down, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| I believe TVA will require a public meeting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Thanks, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Anything else that's on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Dwight, I guess you're going to talk about the HUD report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| I can speak to it in general terms on behalf of the mayor, Commissioner Eric Hoagland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| from community development would actually answer any technical questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| So you just want questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| If you've got any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| He is the subject matter expert and it is a fairly technical report if you reviewed the HUD audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| I really don't feel as qualified to speak to it as Mr. Hoagland is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| I've just got one question and I may have some more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| But if it is a conflict on the federal funds and if we swap it with county funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| how would it not be a conflict on the county level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| That's just a remedy that HUD has used in practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| I don't care what HUD says because they can say what they want to about federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| But we authorize county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| So do we not have a conflict of interest on county money, taxpayer money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| Well, when HUD issued their ruling, they were basing that on their section of regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| So when I guess they kicked that back to the county, then local county laws and state laws take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| So what HUD is saying to make them whole would be if you take local funds and switch that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3397)|
| 0:56:47| and switch that, they're just, in essence, making them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Now, I can't speak to state and local laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Mr. Law Director, in order to do that, does that not have to have approval of this body to switch funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| Because is that not a change of the budget, budgetary items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| I think they're asking, isn't that a matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Are you bringing up, are you going to be bringing that before county commission in order to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| Yes, it's my understanding that once we get an arrangement that's acceptable to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| we would bring it to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| And, Commissioner, to clarify what Mr. Hoagland is saying is in the case of the HUD finding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| it was the relationship, the presence of staff on certain boards of non-profits that created the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| And we're going to remedy that and make the shift of funds in a case where there is no such conflict at the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| or federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| So we'll make certain that we move monies from a project where no member of our staff serves as an advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| to that body or on their board or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| But are you going to do that after the fact or at the time the money would have been granted would they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| in a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Or are you talking about the shakeup right now and then next month we will transfer the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| and at that point there would be nobody on the county that would be distributing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| that would be on a non-profit board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| If I understand the question correctly, we're going to look for a project where there would not have been a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3492)|
| 0:58:22| at the time that the original funding decisions were made and the budget was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| or a conflict now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| And right now you're seeking approval and working with HUD to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Bring it back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| So no money will be redirected or HUD will not be repaid until it comes before this commission body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| And HUD will be giving us some help in this respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| They're actually going to offer conflict of interest training on a statewide basis because other jurisdictions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| experiencing some confusion with these regulations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Eric, just a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Nothing against Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I think her volunteer work should be applauded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| But with her still being on the senior staff of the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| is that not in itself still a conflict if the mayor's office is who eventually has to give approval before it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| before a commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Because if she's sitting on a board of a non-profit organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3576)|
| 0:59:45| and you and the mayor and the rest of the staff decide to bring that forward as recommending to this body that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3585)|
| 0:59:55| deserve HUD money, is that still not a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| although she's no longer overseeing community grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| What we've established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| and what's been reported is right now we're just dealing with community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| We're going to have citizen review panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| We've not put out on the street anything for a call for any kind of applications for our HUD money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| What we're doing first is we're going to clear up the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| And while we're clearing up the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| we're also going to have our citizen review panels come in with community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| We're going to see how that works with community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| And if it's a success, which we think that it will be, we'll then have them do the same thing on the HUD side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| You know, first things first, we were going to clear up the HUD audit before we even talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| But what I'm talking about in our next budget, well, I've not got an answer yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Community services director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| In regards to conflicts, if there are conflicts with any individual, even commissioners that serve on boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3660)|
| 1:01:11| Your family members that serve on boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Those are things that we will try to work through HUD to try to get some guidance from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| I mean, because what I don't want is because you're still within, although you no longer oversee the grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3679)|
| 1:01:27| is it still a possibility of being a conflict of interest because of the position you serve in as being a senior director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| within the mayor's staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| That's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| It's not aimed at anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I just want to make sure that when HUD comes back in and audits us possibly again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| that we're not sitting here with the same problem whether or not you're over the community grants or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| I just don't want for anybody in Knox County to be placed in that situation because of the senior level of the position you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3710)|
| 1:01:59| Well, number one, that's why we are asking HUD to come in and give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| If they don't do it on a statewide basis, we've already got them confirmed for them to bring in a national professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| Just do it with us directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| So one, we'll get the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| But as I am aware of the regulations, I don't think that will be a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| because what we'll have into place is one, we'll ask any applicant before we make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| or a recommendation or what have you, are there any known conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| whether it be board members or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Then when we make that recommendation, that goes before a 30-day public comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| So if at that point we've flushed out any kind of conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| that is when we will then go to HUD and say, look, there's an indirect conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| I think if it's a direct conflict of interest, we don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| If it's an indirect conflict of interest, then we go to HUD, say this is we would like this exemption prior to any kind of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| and go ahead and get the exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| And that way we're open and transparent throughout the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| The citizens know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| You all as a legislative body knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| The executive branch knows that there is a potential conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| And more important, HUD knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Yeah, and that they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So just because Cynthia is on the staff, it won't be a conflict now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| I guess the question might be that if maybe 10 Corp or somebody like that comes before HUD money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| that's when we would make that issue be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Just like when you all do the vote, you let it be known, but you can still vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| That's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| We need to let it be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| There could be a potential conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Seek HUD's guidance at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Get either the red light or the green light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| And if it's the green light, then we come back before you all and say this is our official recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| Do you approve or do you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| And then that's how it probably should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| If you could get that answer from HUD, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| We'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Commissioner, we'll also provide you with the regulation 570.611 that talks about exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3845)|
| 1:04:13| I think that's what Eric is trying to share with you there in regards to exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| What are the exceptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| There's an exception that says, upon written request from the recipient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| HUD may grant an exception to the provision of the paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| And it's got A, B, D, and C, HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| And as Eric has shared with you, that's what we're trying to get guidance from right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| What about the money that's already gone to these agencies, the nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| and they've already spent this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| That was a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| In regards to the ones that we're checking with HUD, HUD is trying to give us some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| I know, but say if HUD had $30,000 and county money went with it, $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| Say a nonprofit got $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Would they have a mix maybe of federal funds and county funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| So if they say the $30,000 from the federal funds were improperly or there was a conflict at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| but just the organizations had already spent the $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| I think what the key word in the report that we need to focus in on is not of a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| It was HUD disallowed that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| But let's get back to if it's the $30,000, and we'll use your wording, disallowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Then do we get the $33,000 back from the nonprofit so we can repay HUD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| Well, the way that HUD's report reads, and I've got it over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| but I think they've given us three remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| The first remedy that we have is Knox County could just cut a check back to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| which HUD would then give that over to the Treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Treasury would put that back in Knox County's coffers, and then we would put that back out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| So there's a couple steps involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| The other remedy we have, and the one most widely used, is just the bookkeeping swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| And that is basically all we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| We'll have to research all the monies that we gave out in community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| find the one that meets all the HUD requirements, that is clear from any kind of conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| and then say, this is what we're going to swap this out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| Because in essence, if we cut them a check, it goes back to the Treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| We just then have to have the added work of putting it back out on the street again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Whereas all they're trying to say is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| But the question, after, say, that budget is, when was this budget, what year was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| This would have been last fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| So the books are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Books are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| So after the books are closed, do we send it to Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Do we send something to Nashville after we close our books to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| I guess I'd have to yield to finance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| You know, what we're required to do is just submit an annual report to HUD of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| And once that gets closed, that gets closed in HUD's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| That's our level of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| The budget's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| So how do we go back and open it up and even take this money from this line and put it on this line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| If it's already closed and it's already been audited by our auditor and sent to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| after we're audited, I think it goes to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| You know, if memory serves me correct, that we did this once again in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| We've swapped out after the fact of what HUD disallowed a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| And the same year is when we also funded, the county gave the city $300,000 to do Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| And we went in and just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| And I assume that if this is wrong, I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| But I think it's just a line item transfer that that's what goes back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| Now, how that gets done after the books were closed and audited, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| I'll have to get somebody from finance down to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| I guess we can talk about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| But who is the community grant department reporting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| Now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Well, if Ms. Finch is no longer going to be over it, I mean, who's going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Mr. Hoagland will report to Mike Arms as the chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| So Mike Arms has no problem with people that he knows that could be asking for county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| Well, again, a couple of points that we need to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| One, we will no longer be making recommendations to this body as appropriators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| We will have the citizen review panels and they will bring their recommendations to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| And at the end of the day, it is this body's prerogative to award those monies as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| You may follow their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| You may opt to ignore their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| But they will be community-based recommendations and not recommendations of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Let me stop you right there because a few years ago we, I think the mayor restructured his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| because I think at one point in time maybe the commission had done those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| And I think that the mayor said he wanted to restructure the office to have someone that would oversee the grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| so we would, you know, they would have people going out to make sure people were doing what they were getting the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| from the taxpayers to do because there were some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4183)|
| 1:09:51| What I can remember for years ago from looking at the budget from even before I was on commission is that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| that the commission would have a list of those who have asked for what from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4198)|
| 1:10:08| and then the commission would either approve it or alter it or some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| But I don't know who I believe that came from, whether you're talking about Kessel or Schumpeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| I think I remember, and I can't say for sure, but I thought your dad might have been over someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| And they brought the non-profits in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| They came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| They had a budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| First they'd start off with, you know, the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| They'd come in and ask for whether or not they needed more money or if they were fine with their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| And then they would have the community non-profits would then come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| and they would ask for a certain amount and try to give reasons why they felt like they deserved it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| and what they would do with it and answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| And some of them would be that were already on the list that the county executive at the time would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| And then the commission would obviously, as we do now, we have to put final approval on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| So I still think it still came from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| That's exactly right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Under the former mayor or county executive, Kessel, that information was all prepared from the county executive's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4275)|
| 1:11:24| And the things that we did add, which I must say that we're very, very proud of adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| is that we added a whole bunch of performance measures, reviews, forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| documents that did not exist under the prior administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| So that whole enhancement has been truly enhanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| As it relates to disclosures, those disclosures, the way that we have it set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| this new enhanced process that we have in place now is something that was not in place prior to this ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| ever happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| There was no appropriate request for a conflict, for disclosures, for anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| other than the fact that if we knew that there was someone on the board we would have the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| that information was communicated up through the ranks through to the county mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| So the processes that we have now prior to Dwight Kessel, they have just been enhanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| because we now have those kinds of things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Well, that's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| But it seems like we created positions that we didn't have under prior administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| to make sure these non-profits did what they told us they were going to do to receive taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4348)|
| 1:12:36| And they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I'm going to go into the defending non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| Well, I'm saying they're real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I mean, I voted for them many times and there's a lot of them that's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| But if you all are turning that over to a citizen board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| That part will not be turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| The due diligence in regards to receiving the application, the forms that need to be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| the staff will still have to prepare all that information and give then a booklet to our citizens review panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| So they will get all the due diligence, the check, check, check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Have they done a conflict of interest for everybody that's serving on their board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Have they done a conflict of interest form acknowledging that they might have relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| whether they be friendly or family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Have they done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Do they have all their applications and licenses and certifications with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| Have they done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Do they have a budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Do they have their bylaws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| That will be still done by Eric and now Mike Ormson's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| That will be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| And then when the citizens review panel gets their booklet, their booklet will have a form on top saying that these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| have been checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Tell me just how the citizens review board will be created, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| Well, I'm going to give it to Eric because Eric and his staff has been working diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| and making sure the public had information about how they can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| What we did is we just basically threw out a call to all citizens to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| come forward and help us out with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Let me stop you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| How did you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Because, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Well, I think there was the news carried a couple of stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| We placed an ad in the paper, several papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| I think I can't remember which all ones, but I know it was the New Sentinel, maybe Metropulse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| Fountain City Focus, maybe Hall Shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| I don't know exactly all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| We provided flyers to commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| And we did a web story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| So we got the call out there to any citizens to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| I think Mr. Arms came down and gave you guys the letter and applications to be on the citizen review panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4470)|
| 1:14:39| to let word of mouth go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Anybody you thought or anybody in the county that wanted to come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| this was their chance to become involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| We got 50, I believe it's 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| It could have been 59, but I'm pretty sure it was 58 applications in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| We then went through and automatically anybody that was an employee of Knox County was not asked to be on the panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4500)|
| 1:15:11| and or anybody that was an employee of an agency that is requesting funding, they not be on the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| So when you did that, that left you with 47 citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| And we tangled with, okay, now how do we, what do we do at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| Do we use them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Do we just do a complete randomization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| And the decision was made if 47 people came forward and wanted to be involved, let all 47 be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4535)|
| 1:15:43| So what we then did is we're going to have an orientation tomorrow for them to come forward for us to tell them this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| And what I just got finished telling you guys, and this is where we'd like to go, but we need your all's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| This is an experiment we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| And it's an experiment that we're basing on our federal regulations on how we let the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| We are required under federal regs to show that we had citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| So we're trying to take those same principles and apply those to the county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| So you said employees would not be serving or employees of a non-profit who is requesting funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| What about people serving on non-profit boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Is that part of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| We took them off with regards to if there is somebody on a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| We also have several categories in which people are requesting funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| So, for instance, if I'm a tourism and cultural organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| and I'm on that board because a lot of people who volunteer are asked to volunteer in other places also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4611)|
| 1:17:01| This is a lot of work with no pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| So we didn't want to disregard their spirit of volunteerism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| However, if I'm on a board of a health organization in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| I'm not going to be on the panel that reviews health organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| I can be on a panel that does tourism, youth, some other panel outside of the organization they're affiliated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4642)|
| 1:17:32| So that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| We're going through now each grant application and making everyone know of any conflict of interest that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| whether direct or indirect, we're putting that on a cover sheet so when these panelists get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| they know already this board member may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| I mean, the one that comes to my mind is so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| There's a board member whose spouse is a Knox County teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| or is employed maybe with a business that does work with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| We're not making those calls as to whether that's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| We're letting the citizens know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| These are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| That's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| And if you feel strongly enough that they don't deserve funding, you need to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| And we're trying to guide them through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| We're not trying to just dump the decision making on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| We're just trying to say some hard decisions have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Help us make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Okay, last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| How much money, because I don't have that budget book, how much money do we give to non-profits in a budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4711)|
| 1:18:40| And how much of that is Knox County taxpayer money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| And how much of it is federal funds and state funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| Scott, I hate to correct you, but the federal funds, those are taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| I know they're taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| The states are taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| But I'm just in the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| I mean, I can speak on averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| But I think on average we give just four something, over four million dollars a year in county funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| which we call community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| And then HUD gives us just under, in the neighborhood of 1.5 million to give out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| Now, 1.5 million doesn't hit the street because there's certain caps we have to give money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| There's certain categories of money we are federally obligated to fund, what are called community housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| development organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| We must take 15 percent of our money and fund those type of organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| But they hit the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| But it hits the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| I would venture a guess of probably, on average, $800,000, $900,000 because we have to also pay for our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4780)|
| 1:19:50| the administration of the grants and what comes with our compliance, our consolidated planning efforts, reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| All that comes from the federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| We do our, the county operates a housing rehabilitation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| All that money, it hits the street, but it doesn't hit the street in form of a grant to an agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| It actually goes to an individual household, low-income household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| And what about, is there any state funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| We do get state funds, but to my knowledge, the only state funds that we have any affiliation with actually gets through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4818)|
| 1:20:28| the Tennessee Department of Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I think they're actually on this month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| But all we are are more or less just a conduit to help juvenile court with their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4834)|
| 1:20:42| We really, we just do the paperwork pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| And they do the actual work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| But that's really all our department is affiliated with statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Now, we used to get federal appropriation money, but that's long gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| We don't get that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Eric, are you familiar with the United Way allocations panel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| Well, we got our grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| That's, we're borrowing a lot from the United, you know, it's a funny story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| The United Way took our compliance piece and implemented that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| And there, as a return, we took their citizen panel piece and put it over with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| It's very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| You can learn a lot from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Question I had, I don't know, Mr. Chairman, if I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| I'm sort of on the same lines as what you are on this money that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| HUD says that money should not go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Here's a question I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| If HUD says money goes to a non-profit group and it got there illegal and it's been there for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| my question is why does that non-profit board not owe that money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Why does Knox County have to rejuggle and shortchange another non-profit agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| To me, it looks like that non-profit agency board, it's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| Commissioner, as Eric has explained to you, the federal guidelines have certain guidelines in regards to what they might disallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| And I must say that on the county side, as it relates to community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| our process and guidelines in regards to how an agency becomes eligible for community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| none of those agencies have either violated and or did anything inappropriate to be eligible for those grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4937)|
| 1:22:25| When we put our notice out for grants eligibility, those organizations apply for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| When we ask for those organizations to do their performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| those agencies went through the same rigorous performance standards and guidelines as everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4955)|
| 1:22:45| So on the county side, the issue about disclosure, conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| does not necessarily apply in verbatim words because they don't exist on that side on verbatim words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4972)|
| 1:23:00| I'm just in question, Cynthia, about the 33,000 that we keep hearing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| In fact, 33,000 went to that board, and I don't know the name of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| but went to that board and it was done illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Then to me that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Not illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| It was disallowed because it did not meet the exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| Disallowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| The word is not disallowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| What was the exception that it didn't meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| The exception was in regards to the organization that had some relationships to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| That organization was Ten Court Community Services, Inc., Family Securities, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| which is a nonprofit that provides health care services and education to individuals in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| Subcontracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| And the word is subcontracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| Now, the particular area where we erred as it relates to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| not knowing that if an organization subcontracts with another organization, that, too, must be disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| In the history of county government, I'm telling you, in the history of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| never before has any administration asked an organization, who are you buying goods and services from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| So we started digging and started looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| And if the media started looking, as they have looked and done their due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| you would begin to find all kinds of issues where an organization that we gave federal monies to had bought goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5054)|
| 1:24:23| and services and are contracted with individuals that might have a direct, indirect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| and or a perceived conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Now we know different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| When I told Eric, I said, yes, we've learned our lessons as it relates to asking the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| Mr. Agency One, you are eligible for a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| Now, if you buy goods and services, you've got to make sure that you do not create a conflict by buying goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| services, and are contracting with someone that could cause you to have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| So the conflict is with under HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| I know Commissioner Smith's got the floor, but I've got two questions for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Did TNCOR receive money in previous years before you were director of the grant program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5106)|
| 1:25:14| You'd have to go back and look at finance in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Can you do that for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| And also, it was in the media, and I don't know if it would have been this one or another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| but the media asked you how to get a hold of this director of the nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| And you said you didn't know, and then it came back and it was your sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| I am hopeful that this commission and this level of leadership will not use the media as their sole source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5139)|
| 1:25:49| their sole source to provide and ask questions of this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| That's why I asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| I mean, so you didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| I did not say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| You did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| Nobody ever asked you, and you never said anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| I'm going to say this for the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| To each one of these commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| I have disclosed fully my relationship with this organization that provides services to youth for the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5167)|
| 1:26:17| I did it when I first came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| I did it before I came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| I have done it all along to this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Now, do you all know it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| Or did you know it, Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| I know he said, well, you know what you should have said to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I mean, I want to say to you right this minute that this information has been disclosed to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| to this administration over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| We're not getting on you, but it's a new era of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| And I want to bring it to closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I want to bring it to closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| We've got a lot of things we'd like to bring to closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| But I want to bring it to closure with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| And I'm going to say this to my fellow media in regards to what they report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| And I'm asking you as a leadership, do not, please do not use the media as your sole source in regards to making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5217)|
| 1:27:07| or making comments in regards to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| We have taken every effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| We have a wonderful staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| And I feel like that I have been a very, very good administrator in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| Have I shared and been up front and disclosed everything that I possibly could disclose to this administration over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| and over and over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| There has been numerous times that there has been elected officials that have been to the organization that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| I founded in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| It's provided services to hundreds of youth, hundreds of youth and hundreds of women that are pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| Now, the issue that has been created with family security under the HUD problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| we recognize that there's a step that we should have put in, which we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| That was to ask these agencies, if you buy goods and services in our contract with someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| if you create a conflict, we need to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| So then we can use the section in HUD that says you can ask for an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| Because we could have asked for an exemption for family security had we had an understanding that they were going to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| goods and services at the time that they bought goods and services from that agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| Now, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| The last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| On the application, the organization that applies, do they say that we have relationships with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| that we have elected officials that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| They could at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| I mean, is there a place on the application that says the relationship, my brother is county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| and I'm the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| We have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| We do have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| In the past it has not been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| And that's why we're saying that we appreciate the opportunity for this level of leadership, this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| to work with this department that now reports the microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Because I will not, and I won't say it twice, I will not continue to serve this community in the capacity as a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5336)|
| 1:29:04| I've been doing it for 30 years, and I'm going to continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Because I'm the person that has been the voice for the least of these, those that have been poor, those in the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| those throughout this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| And I will not stop doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| You all can have all your political concerns and questions that you want, but I will not stop doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| And that's why I made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| I made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| And I, like whomever at the news sentinel made a statement this morning that I was forced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| I was not forced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| I made the suggestion to the administration that here is a way to rectify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| Allow me to continue to do my grassroots work, working with individuals in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| and then allow somebody else to do the administrative piece that I helped create that did not exist before I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5385)|
| 1:29:53| You all were given out, not this commission, because I don't know where Craig is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| He might have been on the commission before we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| But there was nothing in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| There was nothing in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| If I want to start going through a whole bunch of problems that I discovered, that I discovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| and said to my mayor, we need to put things in place so that we can be more accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| so that we can have all things in process, and so that the individuals that are going to provide services to this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| are clear and they can do it and we can help them be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| That's all we have tried to do is help our organizations be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| Well, you know, it's a new day in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| We just want everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| It is a new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| To be as open as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| And that's why I say that I will hope this commission, those that are elected now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| those that want to have an opportunity to serve, that they work with the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| and help the administration do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| And not use the media as their sole source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Because on many, many occasions, they have either misquoted, not reported correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| and have been doing this community a disservice in regards to trying to help it heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Commissioner Lambert or Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| I have some questions for Cynthia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| And Cynthia, my concern is, now, I didn't hear this on the radio this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| but I was told that on the Howler and Hill show that you alluded to or implied that this commission had racial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| motivations for looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| I didn't say anything about the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| I didn't say anything about the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| I was talking about the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| You were talking, so you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Yeah, I said something about the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| And as far as I'm concerned, this does have, reek with the potential of racial and sexual overturns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| From the, so you're saying that the media is being racially biased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| I am saying that there has been situations where I feel as an individual where I have not been treated fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| and where there is opportunities for us to grow as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Well, Cynthia, I mean, I have felt at times that I have not been treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| Well, Commissioner, if you want me to say specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| you were so concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Don't let me get to the issue where you were concerned about me as an African-American female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| I have no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| You have said that to me, and I have shared with you that I did not want to have a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| That's when I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I said I didn't want to have a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| So if you want to start getting into the issues about racial overturns and racial kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| we can get in a conversation because you're the one that brought it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| I ask you if, because you were the only one who was not receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| Can I interrupt both of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| And I ask if there were, if I said I was concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| You are the person that brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| You are the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| I have been here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| I ask you, Commissioner Lambert, just wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| You know, everybody talking at the same time and getting into some kind of racial discussion about race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| If there's a question that you want to ask, ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| And if there's a question you want to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| I'm asking you, do you believe that this commission, myself or anybody on this commission, is motivated racially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5583)|
| 1:33:12| I feel that this commission could do a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| So are you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| I'm saying I feel this commission can do a lot better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Cynthia, I'd like you to take a look at some of these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| I don't want to take any look at those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I don't want to take a look at those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| You all can look at the pictures and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| This is about this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I'm not going to tolerate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| That is racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Racism exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| There are people out there that have threatened my life, threatened this commission's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| for no other reason than the fact that we said we don't want you to bring your hate speech to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| We are a community of diverse people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| This ends or I'm leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| Who respect and honor each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| This ends or I'm leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| And my life was threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| This whole commission's life was threatened because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Now, when you throw out and accuse us in a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| Mr. Lambert, I hate to interrupt you, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Chair, I'm ready to answer any questions that you have about the HUD audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| This is for Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Where's Eric at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| We can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| We'll be discussing this at full committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| So I'm just going to limit one question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| On this review committee, oversight committee for the citizens you've picked, y'all have already picked those people, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| We've not picked anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| We just threw out the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| And who came through the door is who came through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| I had a lady call me and told me she had already been picked for it and asked me what I knew about the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| No, we sent out letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Once we did that initial review of not anybody that's employed by the county or employed by the agency, they didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5682)|
| 1:34:51| I think we sent them a thank you letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| But we're sorry we can't ask you to serve in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Anybody that anybody else got a letter saying on Thursday, please come to the Family Investment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5697)|
| 1:35:05| We're going to have an orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| And that's just going to be the first of many dialogues we're going to have with these 47 people that's come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5706)|
| 1:35:15| The other thing we don't the biggest question we've had is what kind of time commitment is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| So, in essence, we're treating this almost like a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| It's just, you know, here's the task we have at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| Help us achieve this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| And for those that, you know, can't make it the whole duration, then, you know, they'll drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But we did not want to blow anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| I realize this was the mayor's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| But I don't see how this is going to solve any problem because we still have to vote on these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| And we're still going to be in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| We have no people on that committee whatsoever that we have any say so over picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| All we're going to do, you're going to come bring names down here and we're going to vote to approve them or disapprove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| We've, the only thing we did is like we sent out a, when we sent out the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| I'm asking you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| How do you arrive at who goes on or does commission have any say so other than vote yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Mr. Pinkston, I think what they've done is they've not even, they're not bringing it to the commission to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| They've just went ahead and anybody that submitted an application is serving on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| We're still in the dark is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Provide a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Ms. Finch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| You want, we can provide you with a list of those immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| We're still in the dark and we need to see a resume on every one of these people that's on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| And we need to have the right to either vote up or down the ones that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| Now, I'm going to have to say this 47 or 58 people, that may be too many people on there as far as I'm concerned to get an agreement on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5808)|
| 1:36:57| Well, as Eric shared with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| I realize you don't want to take anybody off, but sometimes you have to make hard decisions, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| Remember, this is volunteer work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| And to date, I think there's over 100 and something, how many applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| 158.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| There's 158 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| And those applications are about so thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| So the more volunteers you have, and I commend Commissioner Smith recommended that we get some guidance from United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| This is exactly how United Way does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| But what we can do immediately when we leave this commission meeting is make a copy, a book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| and have every commissioner have a copy of all of the volunteers, citizens that have stepped up to the plate to say we'd like to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5852)|
| 1:37:41| So you can have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| And it includes their conflict of interest, their disclosures, I think a little, like a semi-resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| So you'll know more about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| It will provide you with that document as early as in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| And can you also see what commission district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| I think it has it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| We asked for zip codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| So we'll be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| I don't think we asked the specific question which district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| We just got the zip code so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Well, if you could check before you send it out and see if each district is maybe have some representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| So one district is not overloaded with the volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| I just want to know how you went about arriving about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| And a lady called me and told me she had already been on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| But apparently you're not disallowing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Other than those that Eric shared with you at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| Those that are organizations and those that might be employees of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| And I will say this, Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| I've read the HUD report and it was just you disclosed to the mayor and the people that you had this conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| So you have to say the buck needs to stop with the mayor there on any of these things that we've done on these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| Because you revealed that you were on these boards and your relationships with different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you for the opportunity to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Dwight, Cynthia, Eric, thank you for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Mr. Chairman, I had a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| We've got one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| Cynthia or Eric, I guess these boards, you've got 50 or so people that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| We'd like to have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| You'd like to have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| I assume that you would have all 50 of them here, all 158 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| I assume you would group different panels and they'll hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| We gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| We let them know that we have four categories of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| I think it was youth, health, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Youth, health, social services, economic development and cultural arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| Cultural arts and veterans and senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| So you'd have, I don't know, maybe six, seven people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| I don't know however many sitting on a panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Then they would then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Make a recommendation to give so much money to an agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| We're still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| So from that point, how does it, what's the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| Does that then go to an oversight committee or does it just come straight here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| Well, all that information will then be submitted to the mayor collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| And then the mayor will then prepare that to bring to commission during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| So we'll have a panel of, how many do you think will be on a panel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| What we started with was 25 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| We thought if you took 25 to 35 applications, given about a five-minute review time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| that would be a reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| I can sit and review 158 because, you know, I'm getting paid from eight to five to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| What I'm saying is that you've got a group of citizens, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| and they're going to make this recommendation that they're going to give them X number of dollars to this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6041)|
| 1:40:49| That's going to come directly to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Yeah, what we are going to propose to them because, you know, when we go to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| they are helping us arrive at an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| So it's just like doing, you know, a high school science experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Well, I assume that what you'll do is you'll say, panel, you've got X number of dollars to divide up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| make sure that it adds up because this is all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| And then you're going to assimilate it and then present it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| What we've done is we've standardized an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| So every agency that's submitted an application, they've had to answer five standard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| And then we've come up with a checklist or a questionnaire for these panelists that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| based on the information provided, score this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| And that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| So give it a score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| If it's, you know, wherever they might fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| If they fall at a 58, probably not going to get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| But if they've got a perfect score, then, you know, they're probably going to get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| Will these agencies put down in their application how much they're seeking, whether it's $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| whether it's $10,000, $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| We ask for that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| We ask for an itemized budget of how there's going to be how much of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| I mean, there's many cases where they've asked for $5,000 and that's their entire budget is $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| There's plenty of cases they've asked for $5,000 and they've got a $3.5 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| So it's, you know, not even 1% of their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| But in with all these, you have the whole gambit of nonprofit organization in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6145)|
| 1:42:34| And we've tried to streamline that, standardize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| and streamline it into a workable group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| It's something that you won't overburden these volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| And we're trying to keep that number to about 25 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| So, you know, a bulk of the applications that come through the door have been in the fields of youth services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| and I believe it's social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| So you've got youth and social that are taking the bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| So the bulk of the volunteers are going to have to go to those two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| I was just curious as to how that process was going to work, you know, from them making their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| Does it go to the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Do they adjust it any or will it just come from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| And the only thing that the mayor's office is going to do is print it up and send it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| We can provide you an outline of how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| And then anything, any other information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| If you give like a flow chart of how it works, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| We'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| If we don't have anything else to talk about or add or take, the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| And, again, Dwight, Cynthia, Eric, thank you all for coming down this afternoon and discussing the report with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080109?start=6233)|
