| 0:00:00| Well, see, I agree, and I really want to commend the office holders that have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| But what we still don't have is the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| And I know, I don't know about you all, but I've received a lot of phone calls about these reappraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:16| Most of them dealt with misunderstandings that their taxes were going to go up 15% or 18%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:21| But they're always asking, what are you guys doing down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=21)|
| 0:00:24| What's going on in those offices as far as budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:30| And I think that for them to have a budget process, just like the sheriff comes down and has to present his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| the superintendent of school presents his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| It opens the Ã± it provides an open forum for them to explain where the taxpayer's money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:46| It also gives us a chance to see how the money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| And there may be some good ideas that come out on how to improve things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:56| Also, it deals with the purchasing cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=56)|
| 0:00:57| And I mentioned already that when we have everything in one office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| even if it's nothing but buying bulk paper for printers, we can get that a lot cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:08| Also, the P-cards, there can be controls that are put on them that are very, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| Some people think we need to eliminate the P-card system entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| and I don't agree with that because large companies do this and they run things very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:25| And you can put controls to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| Also, it has to do with contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| There's just a whole series of these and also the human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| The Roderick, Vermont area talked about a lot of problems in resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| I think that our trustee could spend his, spend the rest of his term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| and career trying to come up with all of the human resource employee books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| and trying to meet all the requirements of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| It's a fairly extensive grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| There's an extensive hiring process that I think is a lot more than what any of the office holders really should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| spending their time on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| I want the trustee taking care of the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| I want the court clerk to be doing their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| and not all of this other stuff that they're having to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| And there also are efficiencies by size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| And we're just, you know, we're just not taking advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| I go back and look, and I'm just going to use an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| He's standing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| If I want to run against J.J. or any office holder, then I would, during my election time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| I would use that time to go against their budget and say, I can do this better or that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| And the voters, over 75 percent, voted at the last election that they wanted to still pick who they wanted for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:50| fee offices and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| And that to me is where we, that can be vented during the election process if the candidates that are running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| So if somebody's charging too much money during their four years that they're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| then the challenger can point that out to the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| You know, I'm not going to say a whole lot on this other than, you know, just a general history lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| And I agree with Commissioner Burroughs in that, you know, law directors are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| I mean, when I make statements, you know, that say they may be construed as not supporting the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:41| I want to keep it in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| And the context is, for a long time, we had opinions at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| We had opinions at the state level that said, hey, you guys are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| You can keep running for office as long as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| They were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| So I guess what I'd like, and once this whole thing weighs itself out, however the vote turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:13| however we move forward, whether it's a lawsuit or not, once this thing gets disposed of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| I'd like to know what we can do as a county on our charter and what we cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| We really have to answer those questions in order for us to legislate properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| It's always, I mean, you know, in the year plus that I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| we just get to a point where we say, no, that doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Well, why doesn't it apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| You know, so I'd like to get, and maybe it's just a uniform document that we send up to the state and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| this is how we're interpreting our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| These are the things we're going to start doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| And let them vote it up or down because, you know, we hear certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Okay, constitutional officers, well, but they can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| They can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| And honestly, it's beyond this administration as far as the law department goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| So it's not directed at the law department per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| It's just confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| It's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| It's hard for us to get our arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| I think when the citizens voted for a charter form of government, they wanted local rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| They wanted home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| So I think the citizens have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Now, if they don't, citizens don't want that, we'll get a, you know, we'll get another petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| and we'll put it back on to go back under state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| But I think in the 90s, I think in 94, the citizens said we want to have more local control over our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:55| I think this does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| I think this unifies a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| There are a lot of differences with the way our fee offices operated two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| They've gotten a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| There's a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Former Commissioner Moore, when he was running, he said he could save a million dollars more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| and I believed him the day he was elected, and I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Probably multiply it by three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| I think there's monies out there to be saved with more efficient processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| With all that said, I know our law department has weighed in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and it's not supporting what Commissioner Briggs wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| But I really think that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| I think, you know, having these budgets come under the mayor and under our review is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| I honestly think that the charter allows it, but I'm not a doctor or a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| So I'd just like to get the answer to not only this question, but others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| You know, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| What can we not do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. Locke will respond to that at the end when we get to our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Mr. Chairman, I'm certainly torn in several different directions on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| I appreciate Dr. Briggs bringing it forward, and I'm for honest, open government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| I think everyone on this body is, and I know the vast majority of our constituents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| And as far as the hope we don't hurt anyone's feelings with the so-called fee offices, the register, the trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| the property assessor, and so forth, I have no problem with putting those where you're suggesting they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:54| I think the payrolls are evolving themselves to the central payroll office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| So that issue will probably become moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| I don't think the issue of the gentleman embezzling or triple paying himself almost $200,000 would be an issue in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| I certainly feel confident that that will be addressed by the way the payroll is now being handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| I remember the oath I took the last day of August to uphold the charter and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| and I'm strongly, I'm listening strongly to what our law director says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| His opinion is firmly that this is not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| I know the, well, Mr. McAdams, I've known him since college, and he's a brilliant attorney, and I respect his opinion also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| I assume that's where a lot of Dr. Briggs' legal background is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| But sitting here as an elected commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| I still am leaning towards what my elected law director is telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| Having said that about the fee offices, I'm looking at the two main things that county government exists for, the two biggest expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| That's the education of our children and the protection of our bodies and our property and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| I certainly don't feel qualified to tell Enyik and Cannon and Dan Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| and Jim McIntyre what to do with that $375 million I hope we'll appropriate for them this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| although what they do is that they have their budget as an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I agree there is apples to oranges somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| But if we appropriate $100 million for Sheriff Jones, I feel confident he'll tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| he'll show us where that goes, where every dime of it goes during the budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| or the monthly meetings or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| I don't think there's any secrecy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| I don't think he's hiding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| And I don't know that I feel qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| I don't know if the buzzword today has been micromanage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| I don't know if I'm the person to try to micromanage his department and say, well, you're making too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| and this guy's making too little and they need more cars here or less there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| And I would just, I'd love to hear his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| He's been standing here a little while and maybe this is not the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| but I want to for sure hear the sheriff's opinion on this issue if he wants to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Would that be proper now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Come on, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| That's why I'm leaning towards not trying to stick me be the expert or one of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| the expert on the school board and the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| because that's the two big gorillas in this issue, I think, in our budget, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| Jimmy Jones, 400 Main Street, 37921 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| I think you've made my point very well, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| I would like to ask Dr. Briggs the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| You used the word fee officers on several occasions here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| Does that mean that I'm still in this amendment or have you taken me out of this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Well, if you look at the things that we talk about here, what you're doing is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| And I've used you as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| You submit a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| And I'm not talking about micromanaging anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| We don't micromanage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Well, we've had that argument today already, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| But we really don't try to micromanage the sheriff's department, but we do want it to be an open budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| We don't micromanage the schools, but they have a very open budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| The mayor is an elected official, and I think the argument that let's just elect the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| and then they decide how much money they want to spend, if that's the case, just send up here whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| We'll raise the tax rates to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| And then if the voters don't like it, they can get rid of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Well, I think you know that each and every case that we bring to you, we even bring things up here for your approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| that we don't have to bring up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| We follow the contractual agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| We do everything that we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| We don't hire through HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| We do hire through the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| And you also have a grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| We have a grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| And I also, the merit system sends us an eligibility list of who the people we can hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| And we go through the hiring and interview process, and we hire them, and they have a grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| The key issue with the sheriff's office is just like what Commissioner Shouse has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| The state of Tennessee, our legislators have felt it was important enough to pass a law that says the two entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| the two most important entities in government, the education of our children and the protection of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| those two budgets cannot be cut by a commission without the approval of the superintendent or the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| Those are the two key state laws that cover those only, those two entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| They felt it was important enough to make sure that even in tough times, even in bad times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| And the second reason I think they did that was to take the politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Say there's eight or ten guys that don't like Jimmy Jones, for instance, on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| And all of a sudden they all get together and you say, okay, sheriff, next year we're going to cut your budget $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| I can't function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| I'm over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Public safety is in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| That's why they did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| They don't say you can't cut my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| They say you can't cut it without my approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| From the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| From the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Yeah, because we cut this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I want to make that very clear is you can't cut it from the previous year's budget because we cut the school budget last year $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| Whatever the budget was last year, you cannot cut that budget this year without my or the superintendent's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:42| That's the key issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| And I think that they felt strongly enough to do that that we have to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:52| And to me that's the only issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Everything else I do that I bring to commission, I bring to you and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| But I think I have to fight to preserve that right that they felt was so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| You know, and what I would like to do is I'd like to compliment you on that because we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| And I think it serves your office well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| The public respects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| And we actually, at least I hear very few complaints from the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| They might like a few more patrols, but, you know, there's limitations to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| But the point I'm trying to make is that those other offices do not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And I think that they would receive the same support that you do if they brought those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| And I think they would have a lot more support from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| And I think also the sheriff's office is large enough where you can keep a professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| for your human resource issues, whereas some of these other fee offices can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| And I think that benefits the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I think it benefits the citizens, the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| and everyone else is when we have an open process and then turn those other functions over to the professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| And that's the point I'm trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| And I would only say that I think we do an excellent job with the things that happen at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| The men and women that are there are very professional and highly trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| I'm not prepared to comment on any of the other offices because I just don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I'm sure there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Troyer, would you mind coming to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| I see Phil Ballard making his way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Phil, do you want to talk, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| I will recognize you then while I have my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Mr. Troyer, a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| When the fee offices, I'm not talking about the sheriff's department, but I'm talking about like the trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| or the register of deeds, when they come in and present their budget, what is not included in what we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| Salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| We do have provisions in there for office expenses and space costs and some of those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| but salaries and benefits are not included for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Is that the only thing that we don't approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| I mean, is there any other aspect of their budget process that we don't approve other than salaries and benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| Off the top of my head, I can't think of another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| So if when they come before us this year, if we were to ask them, give us your list of employees, their salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| and their benefits, they could refuse to give it to us, but chances are they're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| I mean, they're going to be, I'm sure, forthcoming and say, here are our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| and here's what they make and here's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| That's public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| We receive this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| It's a single audit report findings and recommendations from KPMG and there are two aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| This is new, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| We just got this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| When you look in it, and I haven't perused it very much, but when you look in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| you see that there are some specific recommendations for the fee offices on how to improve their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I mention that because to the audit committee members, I think that it's going to behoove you folks to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| and then take action to make sure that they are complying with the recommendations that are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| But thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| So, John, I appreciate your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I first became aware of the issue with fee offices a few years ago when I was serving on the efficiency panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| And one of the first things that we learned is that Knox County government is not really very efficient because of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:17| And this is just the way that the legislature has set things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And so that was one of the things that we looked at was how do you make things more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| And we found out that there was tremendous resistance to do basically what we're trying to do here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| and that is put the fee office budget under the control of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So we really didn't get anywhere with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| So now we're revisiting the same type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| And when you look at it, there is no question in my mind that we, as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| need to have complete oversight of the budget, not to micromanage, not to tell them what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| but to have oversight of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I do believe that while we should not micromanage, that we do have an obligation to the people who put us here to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| questions, to gather data, make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| No matter how difficult those questions may be, no matter how contentious those questions may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| I think that we have the obligation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| And so I do believe that more accountability is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| I do believe that we need to, if a person is an Oxe County employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| and one of the things we found out in the efficiency panel as well was that depending on where you work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| you may have a different set of policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| For example, if you're in this office, you may have a different policy on leave and vacation or pay or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| In this office, you may have a totally different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| So things are not uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| And it would just seem to me that that would just simplify things, that if you're an Oxe County employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| you're an Oxe County employee and you have all the benefits and rights and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| It takes away some of the political patronage issues that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| But I guess in my mind, it all boils down to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| And that is, is this legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| And I think that's a very important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I'm not against the idea and I'm not against the concept, but what I'm struggling with is this notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| I've known Mr. McAdams for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| I respect Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I believe he's a very smart lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| I appreciate what he has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| I appreciate his insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| He is very passionate about what he has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| I've known Bill Lockett for a long time, and I know that he is a very passionate, a very good attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| I know that he feels very strongly about his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| So it's kind of like we're in the middle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| And it's like, okay, who are we going to go with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I mean, whose opinion are we going to move ahead with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| And I have to make my vote and let the citizens who put me here understand where I'm coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| and that is not against it, think it's a good idea, want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| but I have to go with the guy that's been elected to tell us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| And I believe that he is doing the very best he can with the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| When you look at Mr. McAdams' material, you look at Mr. Lockett's material, they both cite case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| It's very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| It's very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Again, I don't question any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I think they're both sincere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I think they're very passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| But I think when it comes right down to it, my feeling is that I need to go with Mr. Lockett's opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| But then a caveat, I'm all in favor of putting this on the ballot and let the folks vote on it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| And the reason I say that is I don't believe that, and I know that the argument has come up that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| well, they've already voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| No, they voted on whether the mayor basically should have control of having, of appointing these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| That was the main issue in that, even though there were three different things there, that was the main focal point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| That issue has been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| But I believe that the citizens would vote by a rather substantial margin to have those budgets placed under the control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| And Mr. Lockett has said that's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| That's the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| That's the way we, you know, let the citizens decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| And if they decide that this is what they want to do, and I think they will, then we can have this whole thing resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| My time is up, except Mr. Ballard, if you would like to speak, I'll yield to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| And then I appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| And, by the way, I love your facial hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| The commissioners, I just want to stand before you today and maybe educate a little or a few of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And since I've ran for this office, we always get lumped with the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| So I'm going to use this as an educational part of my spiel here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| We are not a fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| We do not collect any monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| We do not have any checking accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| We don't have any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| We go out and appraise properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| That's all that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| And, of course, a little more than that, the mapping, but we won't get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| As far as I know, it's not just Phil Ballard and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| All 95 counties, the property assessors has always been under whatever form of legislative body that existed in that county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1315)|
| 0:22:04| We're already under, we use the purchasing department for all contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Our salaries, we come under the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| We come up here every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| I'm in the middle of the budget, but we come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Our budget has been approved as far back as Mr. Hill, I think, was in office before 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| I don't really think this resolution is designed for the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| I think that's why the people on the charter amendments took it out is because we didn't fall under the budgetary control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| But without a doubt, I even heard Ed use it tonight, and Ed's a good friend that doesn't mean it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| but when you start hearing words improper use, Dr. Briggs used vain for the fee office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| That's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| And I want to make that clear separation before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| We are not a fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Our budget's already under your control, always has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| We use the resources of Knox County in every item that you've mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And it's just redundant to have the property assessor under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| And I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| Really, it sounds to me like you've not done your homework if you don't know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| You may be called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| I'll go in order, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I'll proceed in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| The offices that are currently elected will continue to be elected as the voters have decided in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| This resolution would simply streamline and unify all of the administrative procedures in the county as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:47| under the mayor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| That would simply affect, simplify, quite frankly, your administrative part, not the job of property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| And it would leave that as an elected office and would do that for all of the so-called fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| The budget, the human resources, and especially that that was pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:12| and I thank you, Mr. Hammond, for your comments about the current audit, which I have not reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Obviously, we just got it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| But would simplify and make much more transparent everything that all of us, to include Mr. Ballard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| ran on when we sought the offices that we're now in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| I very much support this proposal, and I think, quite frankly, for the transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| and efficient operation of our county government, this is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And I would appreciate Dr. Briggs bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| You know, the thing that sticks in my mind here is that each of these offices that we're talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| were elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Each of those offices has a job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| They were elected to manage that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| If we were a board of directors and wanted to make changes down in the plant, it would be foolish to make changes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| in the plant where we don't work every day without consulting the department managers who run each of those departments in the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:32| So without consulting with each of these folks and having their ideas and input into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| I don't think we could make that type of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| And it all comes back to what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I believe that these folks were elected to run those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| That's what we elected them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| That's what the people elected them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| And we don't need to be, as our word of the day, micromanaging these departments for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1553)|
| 0:26:03| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| I have heard a lot of opinions today, and I appreciate my commissioner Hammond's opinion and Mr. Ed Schaus's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:19| We've talked about doctors and lawyers all afternoon, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I looked over both positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| You know, as attorneys, you're hired to represent your client and give their point of view as best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And I think that's what's happened in Commissioner Briggs' case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| I think they have given their opinion as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| I think it has a lot of substantive flaws in it from my own personal opinion when I was reviewing it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| But I'm not the law director, and I don't have to defend my position in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| My law director has to defend his position in a court of law if this goes south, and he has to defend me in a court of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| and the rest of us in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| And I personally feel, and the old saying goes, you know, a man who represents himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| he has a fool for a client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| And I'm not going to represent myself in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I'm going to turn to my attorney to represent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I believe that all these are great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| I believe that the people have spoken concerning many of them and have left it in the hands of the people that they elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| That all being set aside, I also think that many times when things don't go the way we want them to go when we were elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| then they use county commission to try to get that position reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| And if we don't get county commission to reinstate it, we use the judiciary to reinstate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| and down the road we go many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I've observed that in Knox County ever since we went to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| I guess as for me in this current situation, I'm going to have to go with my law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| and his legal opinion and have to support that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| I don't think that we have the legal basis to go down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| I think we, as Commissioner Hammond brought out, I wouldn't be opposed to giving it to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| and letting the people decide what we really need to do and whether we legally can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| And that's a real tough one for me to say because I believe Commissioner Briggs' position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| I think, I mean, it's a good thing to do if we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| But I also know that right now in the way I've read the law and the way I've read the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| under the arguments that were given from the side not supporting my law director of weighing the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:53| I think that my law director has a stronger position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| And so that's the side that I'm going to have to go on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| And maybe we can use our powers as the legislative body to give the people a chance to maybe amend the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| or help us get in line with the law to better control our finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| And the last thing being is what I've actually heard tonight is the only thing we have off the table right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| in most of the fee offices is salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| And basically all they use in the fee office right now, they're trying to collect enough fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| is to cover their salary and benefits at this particular point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| So anyway, I just wanted to put in my thoughts so everybody would know kind of where I was sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And as for me and my vote, I'm going to support Law Director Lockett and the legal position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman Pro Temp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| I'm in really a difficult situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| I follow Mike Hammond, Phil Ballard, and Mr. Armstrong, and as you heard me say earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:09| I'm just a country boy that comes to town every now and then and not on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| Commissioner Hammond's remarks, and I'll have to ask Commissioner McKenzie or Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:28| the comments that were made are the same comments you made last summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| when we were looking at charter petition ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| And the same thing that came out then is coming out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| We can't talk about, for example, fee officers and then throw the property assessor in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:52| If you look back at the charter petitions that were on the ballot, the property assessor was not included in those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| But what we had earlier on in the presentation tonight of people calling, asking what's going on downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| and they're referencing things about property appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| I'd like for us to look at that as it's like a knee-jerk reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| My property taxes went way out of sight, so now I need to do something to the people that are downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And as we find out tonight, the property appraiser is not a fee office anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:35| There are lots of other good points that have been made, especially by my esteemed colleague from the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| so I'll ask you to review all of his notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| But there is one other thing that's sort of troubling to me out of how this particular situation is being handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| The appropriate way for commissioners to give their opinion and ideas on things that are taking place in the public is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| to do it on the commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| It's been pointed out to me by my esteemed colleague to my immediate right that there are lots of blogs floating around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| which I don't read, saying something about Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| or myself being uncommitted in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Well, I want to remind everyone here and everyone in the audience that that's exactly the way it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| We shouldn't be making our statements and opinions of how we're going to deal with the actions of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:37| unless you're doing it on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| I can't get my wife to be an intermediary between me and someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| and I don't think there ought to be other avenues available to circumvent the transmission of how I'm going to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:57| but at least that's the standard I will hold myself to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| And then the last standard that I would like to look for us holding ourselves to is following the advice of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:12| I've also sat here long enough to have said that I have served with two different law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| The other one is sitting back there trying to make like he's looking out the windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| thinking about something else because I'm sure he's here on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| But you're both good guys, and I have to trust the opinion that's brought to us by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| So without transmitting my vote in advance, I guess I've transmitted my vote in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Let me let Ms. Brolls go before you if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Ms. Brolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| I guess since I was a co-sponsor, my vote on this was transmitted far in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| But, again, I just want to make sure people don't misunderstand what this is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| It doesn't take away anyone's power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| It doesn't take away or change anyone's duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| It just streamlines processes that ought to be streamlined, especially as we're looking at a tight budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:35| This is something that will save the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| In addition to making our government more transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| which I think all of us made promises to our constituents to try to do just that if we were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:52| I also wanted to ask Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Is Phil still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Do you use the county human resources for all your hiring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| We were up there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| We've been using them to set the salary ranges and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| But as soon as I have a chance to review our policy that exists and theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| and I've been working on that, we'll probably go under theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| But as far as everything, the salary ranges and some other issues, we use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| But you're already using the purchasing department for all your procurement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Our budget has been under it, like I said, since before 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| And it always comes before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Anything we do is line item transferred that you all approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| So really the only thing that you have left to do then is just bringing your human resources into the county, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:49| It's just a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| It's much different anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| So you see the wisdom in the county handling those administrative things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| and leaving your time focused on property assessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| I can't let you leave me there because since we don't collect fees, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| I'm going to try to leave that office as nonpolitical, especially before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| I'm just saying I inherited this coming in the middle of the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| The only thing that I'm stating is the budget and everything has been under this commission for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| And the contracts, the P cards, which we don't use a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| It's one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I don't think there's a $500 limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| And so when I say that it's redundant, really if you think about it as far as me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| whatever you all do today, I'm not championing one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| I'm still under your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| I'm still just like we were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| So this has little effect on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| I'm still under your will and under your control for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Again, one of my major concerns about all of this is that all of our county employees are treated in a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| and equitable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| That's not happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And this will cause that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| And for those who feel like they can't go against the law director's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| I hope that you will see the wisdom in putting this before the voters if this fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| and letting the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Because I agree with Mr. Hammond that I think this is something that the voters have been asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:33| And if you feel that you can't do it because of the law director's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| he has stated that he does agree that that would be a legal way to have this accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| I think the voters made their wishes clear on that they still want to elect these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| But I don't think that that said anything about administrative functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| And I think if you ask those people in the county, they would want all county employees treated in a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| and equitable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Could I make one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I hope Mr. Ballard will not take offense at me saying this, but there have been things that have occurred in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:19| A lot of people didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| And there's two sides to being in the system or being outside the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| I believe he had an occurrence that needed to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| And because it was a situation that Mr. Ballard could talk to the law office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| and it dealt with employees, that it was handled in days rather than drug out over a length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| of getting every committee of every place to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| We can talk about the specifics of that later on if you'd wish, but there are two sides to how do you manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| and can you do it quickly and efficiently and appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| There's a fine balance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| And then the other thing, if I have any moments left, I'd like to recognize Mr. Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Go ahead, Mr. Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Ray H. Jenkins, 9114 Brownlow Newman Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Just a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| It's been said, the phrase has been used many times tonight, that budgeting is an administrative function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| and it is not going to remove any power from the office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| Well, I would suggest to you that these office holders and that anyone who establishes a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| who builds a budget for an organization, establishes their priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| and they manage their office the way they put their budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| So I would suggest to you that there is a significant amount of power involved in putting a budget together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| and establishing those office priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| The other point, and I've been here since 2 o'clock this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| so I have observed that there's not a prohibition against repeating what other folks have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| so I'm going to take this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| The vote that took place back in November where Charter Amendment 4 was defeated countywide by a three to one margin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:39| was not just a vote to maintain the fee offices as elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| I give the voters of Knox County a whole lot more credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| I think they know that it wasn't just a matter of who was going to be elected or appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| it was who was going to have control of those offices, who was going to have control of any administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| or ministerial functions in those offices, who was going to set priorities for those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| And a three to one, they voted for those offices to remain independent from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| Now, we can argue until the wee hours of the morning, or at least until I run out of Commissioner Wright's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:27| whether or not that's the case and whether there were multiple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| and multiple considerations in Charter Amendment 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| And I think that it is perfectly legitimate to put as an individual question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| a specific question about budget operations on the ballot for the voters to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| That individual and specific and singular question can be debated as it should be before a vote before the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| I want to thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| And I don't know if anybody has any questions for me, but I'll just go back over and sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Jenkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| I thought you all were suing, saying that was an illegal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| You all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Well, our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| I thought, well, maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I thought that there was a lawsuit with Commissioner Wright, and I thought you were involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Maybe I'm mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| There was a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Saying that that was an illegal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| No, not that the vote was illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| The lawsuit concerned how the initiative got on the ballot, not whether the vote was valid or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:40| And I'm no longer representing them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| When I'm sitting in this seat, I'm a moderator, and I did want to make a comment or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| and then I'll call on Dr. Briggs, and then I think Mr. Locke will finish this up and we'll probably be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| This is a really interesting case, of course, a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| And the first thing that I think of is that this is a direct result or in line with the fire that was started in Knox County a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:20| And, of course, it's revealed some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| That fire has revealed some things about the county and how the county does business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| which we find disagreeable at the very least sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| And this is another example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| I think the notion, I certainly think that most of us would probably be in agreement that standardization of processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| budgetary processes, are a very good thing for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| They probably will lead to transparency and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Bill Lockett is my friend from childhood, and he'll remain my friend regardless of what I do or how I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:07| But it certainly makes, when you have some personal connections and you're trying to weigh legal considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:16| I have about a thimble full of legal knowledge compared to Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| So I'm really torn in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| I think that the notion that something is legal is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| and the notion that something is helpful is even more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And sometimes those things are not in concert or there's a higher level of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| So this has been a real difficult issue for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| So that being said, I'm still kind of in a state of flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| So go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Well, I was going to turn my light off because I don't think we need to spend a whole lot more time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| One group that we've not heard from tonight, because it seems like part of the hang-up on this deals with the legal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| and the fear of a lawsuit, we've not heard one of the, and I'll define what the fee offices were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| and I did not intend to include the sheriff or the property assessor's office or the court clerk's offices in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| but we've not heard from any of the fee offices at all on how they feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| And will there even be a lawsuit filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I mean, because my understanding is that to have standing, it has to be someone that's harmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| or potentially harmed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| And we've heard nothing but silence from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| Is there any concerns, you know, about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| Or do they agree or disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And if they do, what parts of it do they disagree with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| And if they're going to sue, what are they suing about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| I mean, the whole question on the legal opinions may be mute if they have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:10| I think the reason they haven't spoken is because they weren't asked, and I think that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:20| I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| Okay, are you directing that to anyone in particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| No, I guess if I might chime in on that, I think that it's, I think it would be very naive of us to think that they don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| that that question is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Whether we have asked in front of these microphones or anything of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| I think the fee offices know full well what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| They've known full well what's been going on for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| There's been a defeated charter amendment that said that and a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| So I guess I would question why they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| I mean, they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| The fee offices that this applies to know what people are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| They know what Commissioner Briggs' resolution said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| So I guess I'd turn that equation around and say, why aren't you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| Because if you're transparent, open, and honest, you should show up and say yes or no, we want that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| But to remain silent and let the, you know, bloggers or public sentiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| or debate by this body dictate what the answer is, I think is, you know, it's troublesome to me that no one's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:44| I don't think we had to ask them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I think they should have been here with bells on to say what they felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| I only mention that not as any sort of accusation, but simply because I can't help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| but think that if everyone looked deep down in their hearts, including them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| they think that what we're doing here is probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| And, you know, there is this hang-up that people have on this legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| There may be some other motivations, but I really don't care to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| But if you're talking about something that's right or wrong, you know, I think that what we're doing is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| I think it's in the interest of the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| That's how I started the debate on this, and that's how I'll finish it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| is we have been distracted by this fear of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| I haven't heard anyone that would have standing on this stand up and say, I'm going to sue, and this is why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| and this is why we think that not having, not presenting a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| or not having contracts reviewed by the contracting office is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| And I'll stop there because I think the vote's decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| So I'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| No, if we're going to vote, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| But I thought I'd seen on TV with Commissioner Briggs even there that some of them didn't agree on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2934)|
| 0:49:05| I must not watch that channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| I think really all they said that day was that they just said, trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Did I, Dr. Briggs, did I hear you correctly to say that you did not mean to have the sheriff's office in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| Well, no, the reason I say that is that the sheriff's office already presents a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| We already have his personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| His, you know, just everything that really would apply to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Maybe he doesn't have to do it, but he's already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| And it's the same thing with the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| He's already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| And these offices have felt that the open forum, the open budget process is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| I know we've said we've elected these people to do, let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| Then I don't know why we even have a budget review process when the mayor submits a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| Why not just do what the schools or the sheriff or the mayor, give them what they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Let me ask the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Do you think you're constrained and prohibited from exercising your elected duty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| That's why I explained to you the law of the state of Tennessee that says the commission doesn't have the ability to cut my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| budget without my approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| If you pass this resolution, that would give you the ability to do that, and I could not stand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| I'm going to address legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| I've heard it said by some that this debate has somehow become one between Commissioner Briggs and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3049)|
| 0:51:00| I'd like to say that it is not between Commissioner Briggs and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Commissioner Briggs has put forward a proposal in the form of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| and in the form of an ordinance to be considered by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| and there are policy reasons behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| And many of those policy reasons have been discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| Policy is the commission's province solely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| I am not addressing that aspect of Dr. Commissioner Briggs' proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| only the legality of imposing that proposal on certain offices in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:46| So let me say again that that's all I'm addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| not whether this is a good idea or a bad idea from a policy aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3111)|
| 0:52:01| When this debate began, Dr. Commissioner Briggs circulated a legal memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| and the thrust of that memorandum at that point in time was that in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| the Charter Review Committee passed amendments or drafted amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| which were eventually ratified by the voters in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| And the thrust of that legal opinion was that these offices that we're talking about today were created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:35| That's what that legal memorandum said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| I then undertook, along with others in my office, to research that contention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| and I presented the results of that research to you back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| And the results were that the drafters did not, in fact, create those offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| that they considered language that would do that and expressly rejected creating those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| So we then defaulted to the language of the Charter which says that these offices are governed by the Constitution of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:21| the laws of the State of Tennessee, and the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| So all three apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| In many respects, the legal arguments that have been put forth in support of Commissioner Briggs' proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| are based on an all-or-none proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| On the one hand, these offices must be governed by the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| or on the other hand, they must be governed by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| The truth, in fact, is that they are governed by both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| and that's what I've attempted to articulate in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| In some respects, state law and the Charter sometimes conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| and that is why you can't simply default to the Charter provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| because you would be in conflict with other provisions of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Over the weekend, Commissioner Briggs, and either title is well-deserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:20| Commissioner Briggs, as a courtesy, transmitted to me a more recent legal memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:29| and I had occasion to read it and do some research over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| And I apologize for the lateness, but I attempted to get it in the hands of each of you earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| and it was transmitted by e-mail and hard copy in the Commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| As I said, the first legal memorandum in support of this resolution and ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| was premised on the proposition that the 2006 amendments created the offices of sheriff, trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| register of deeds, county clerk, and property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| I respectfully submit that that contention was rebutted back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:17| Now, the latest response that was circulated, at least that I received over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| really seeks to change legal horses in the middle of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| The latest response says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| The more important point, I'm quoting from that memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| the more important point, however, is that it does not matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| whether these are new offices created by the charter or old offices somehow retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| Well, it did seem to matter a great deal in the first legal memorandum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| But now, after I think it was shown that the Charter Review Committee in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| did not create new offices, all of a sudden, it does not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:11| My point is the legal arguments being put forward in support of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| and ordinance seem to be a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| If they're rebutted once, then the basis in support of them changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| Let me read the ordinance that would be repealed if the ordinance put forward by Dr. Briggs passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:42| And it is, as stated earlier, it's Section 2-478D of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| And Subsection D reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| The trustee, the county clerk, and all other fee officers not subject to the budgetary appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3412)|
| 0:57:02| of the county for operation shall maintain in their fee accounts excess fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| equivalent to three months operating and payroll expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Now, let me go back to that and quote the point and the part that I think is most apropos for this consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:23| and what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Fee officers not subject to the budgetary appropriations of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| This ordinance was passed in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Our charter form of government just came into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| This was part of the original Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| And it was recognized at that point in time that these offices were not subject from a legal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:58| not a policy standpoint, not whether it was a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| but from a legal standpoint not subject to the budgetary appropriations of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| Now, the argument from the very beginning has been that the law already allows this vehicle, this mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:21| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| And this ordinance expressly recognizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| And that's why Commissioner Briggs' proposal, part of what he's asking you to enact, the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:36| would have to repeal this because this recognizes that these offices are not, by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| subject to the budgetary appropriations of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| I wanted to address a couple of things that Commissioner McKenzie mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| We all want certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| And I sense that to a high degree because each of you at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:12| or another has come to my office or called and asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| And we strive to try to give you the best answer we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| And some of you have observed, and I'll be the first to admit, what I am giving you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| and what I've given you before and what I will continue to give you is my legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| It's an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| You are not required by law to follow my advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| And Tom McAdams is an excellent attorney, and he has rendered an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| I try in giving you my opinion to give you the basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| And that's why in what I did before and what I submitted to you today, I gave case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| And I argued to you why I was giving you that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| I didn't ask you to simply accept it because it came from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| but to give you a rational basis for following it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| The legal memoranda circulated over the weekend said that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| it really doesn't matter what the drafters of the 2006 amendment said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| That's irrelevant and should not be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| In what was circulated by my office today, we cited Tennessee Supreme Court cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| that referred to the constitutional conventions that adopted amendments to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| They didn't simply look at the language, but they looked at what the drafters said, the actions they took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| what they debated and what they said in ascertaining the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| And that's what we did in rendering our opinion to you was go to the original intent of the drafters of those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:20| I'm going to close saying two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| A lot has been said tonight about efficiency in government, which obviously is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| People say that government should be run more like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| It should be efficient, costs should be cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| and obviously the taxpayers, those who are paying for government, want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| There's also another principle involved in government, and that's separation of powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| Separation of powers is very inefficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| but that doctrine, separation of powers, is also for the good of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| and it's to guard against concentration of power in one person or one branch of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| From a legal standpoint, I reiterate that I don't believe that what is the subject of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:21| and ordinance can be imposed on these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| By the same token, I'll repeat what I have said in every instance that this has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| It can be done legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| and that is by a charter amendment voted on by the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Commissioner McKenzie asks, why is the law not certain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| It's because it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| The law is not static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| It changes continually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| We try to keep up with those changes, and we try to keep you abreast of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| and we, I hope, have been proactive in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Let me say one more thing about the fear of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| My office does not fear you being sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| We just want to make sure that we're on the winning side, if we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| Thank you, Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you, Commission, for this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| It's been thorough and civil and a very nice example, I think, of the way things should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:42| So are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| What are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Is there any lack of clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| We have no amendments, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| No, I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| We're voting on to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| We're voting to approve 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| This is for approval of Dr. Briggs' resolution to ensure compliance with the budget, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| and operating requirements in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| And I think a roll call vote would be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| And we always start with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| And so let's start with Mr. Pinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| It's just a bad habit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Yeah, Mr. Pinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Let's go that way, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| I may be the only one, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Commissioner Schalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Dr. Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Six ayes, 11 nos, and one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| We've got a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| I was just going to ask that we hear from this gentleman before we go into zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| He's been very patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| I've got one item and then we can get to him and then go to zonings, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| Commissioner Wright, you're light on for what I think it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Now, we're going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| Fellow commissioners, I'd like to thank you for five minutes to take a moment to honor 18 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| This is Resolution 104 on Page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3957)|

| 1:06:10| Assisting in this presentation, I recognize current Commissioner Richard Bud Armstrong and former commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| and I would like for all these people to come down front, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3976)|

| 1:06:29| and Jack Huddleston is probably watching us on streaming data from Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=3989)|

| 1:06:46| I move for approval of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Let's first read it into the record, then we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| Well, just the caption, we've not even read the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| This is a resolution memorializing Billy Joe Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| So we have finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| Finance at 9-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4024)|

| 1:07:07| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| And we've got a motion by Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| And do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Did you wish to have this read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I'm over this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Whereas it is with deep regret that this commission acknowledges the recent passing of Billy Joe Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| and whereas Billy Joe Walker is survived by his beloved wife of 62 years, Betty Smith Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| his daughter and son-in-law, Tamara and Mike Black, five grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| and one great-great-grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| And whereas Billy Joe Walker devoted many years of service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| And whereas Mr. Walker served on the Knox County Commission for 18 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| representing the 8th District beginning in the mid-1970s until 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| And whereas, in addition to his public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Billy Joe Walker worked as an electrician for Sherrod Electric for more than 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| and was a lifelong faithful member of Lions Creek Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| And whereas the Knox County Commission wishes to honor the memory of Billy Joe Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| and expresses its gratitude for the many contributions he has made to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| The Knox County Commission hereby memorializes Billy Joe Walker for his leadership, service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| and sacrifice to Knox County and extends their sincere condolences to his family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the family of Billy Joe Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to be made to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| We got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Commissioners, do you have anything you'd like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Mr. Chairman, we have some people that would like to speak on the family's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| I'll start with former Commissioner Phil Banner, property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| I really want to honor this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| I grew up in the community probably less than a mile from their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| They had a community pool there where I first learned to swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| They have Easter egg hunts on the Walker's property every Easter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| Billy Walker was a great man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| He touched many lives in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| But he's not just a great man because of his service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| He was truly a devoted family man, a lifelong member of Lions Creek's church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| And he was committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| I just can't think of all the help and opportunities he's given to people in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| I've never knocked on their door from the time I was about five years old until just of late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| that they didn't offer me something to eat or something to drink, and we'd go in and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| We'd talk about old times and relive memories and get into some of the little political discussions that he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| and what a passion it was to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| And like a lot of you, you know the value of a spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| I can truly tell you that Betty Walker here truly supported Billy and all the things that he done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| And it's just an honor for me to stand here and tell a little something about him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| because I can never tell enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:49| I guess John Mills was here earlier, but he was called away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| I guess I'm probably the only one that I see that, as I look around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| that had the privilege of serving with Billy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| But when I first came on the commission, he was more than willing to help me learn the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:12| and do anything that he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| And he was a very easy person to talk to and willing to help any time he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:25| And he helped a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| And he'll be sorely missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| My father got to serve with Billy Walker for 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| And any time he spoke with Billy Walker, he always talked about what an honorable and distinguished man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| and really appreciated his service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| And I know that he'd want me to pass that along to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| I'll say a couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I go a little farther back than most of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| I'm about three years older than most of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And a couple or three of them I had in school, so you can see I'm about three years older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| But going back to Billy Walker, he was just a great athlete as well as a great individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| A lot of people don't realize that, but a good baseball and basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| But the family, it really is a shining light in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| And with the Walker family and with Betty, I was afraid somebody was going to call her Mrs. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| I've never heard her called Mrs. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| She's Betty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| And she does, you know, has done a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Tammy is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Tammy, did you not come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Tammy is, they lived beside of us for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Suzanne, the granddaughter, used to crawl over to our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| I won't tell you what she had on, but she crawled over to our house quite a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| And this family has really been a tremendous asset to the Carter community and the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4370)|
| 1:13:00| I'd like to say just a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| The Walker family is the foundation of many county commissioners in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| They set the pace and set the way for most of us that are standing up here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| and most of us that have served from the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| On behalf of all of us in the past, we thank you very much for that foundation and that leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| and the family and the support that you've always given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| who has a proclamation from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| And as stated, a proclamation on behalf of the people of Knox County by his honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| the mayor of Michael R. Ragsdale, to publicly recognize Billy Joe Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:49| It is now, therefore, by the mayor of Knox County, proclaimed April 27, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:58| as Billy Joe Walker Day in Knox County and urge all citizens to join in this observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:07| The mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| Do you wish to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Fellow commissioners, thank you for this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| We had a gentleman here that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Do we want to go ahead and allow him to speak now or take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Let's let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| I just wanted to get your ultimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Sir, if you will restate your name and address for the record, you'll be given five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| William Wallace, 7305 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| And I have to admit, I'm a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| No kin to the William Wallace Oriander, as I explained to you before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| but I am the one that run the bear down up in West Hills and helped him capture that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| I'm not whining about an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| I pay my taxes and I go down to the assessor and I talk to the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| And if he's right, he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| If he's wrong, we'll change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| What I am interested in bringing out in the open is it seems to be a lot of patronage by the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:42| administration in the offices of the assessor and the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:53| I did some research, and anybody can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| There's three, two websites, and KnoxNet, where, that you can go to and you can check anybody's tax record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:07| Check yours, mine, anybody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| I did some checking, and, gosh, I found, you know, a lot of politicians in there weren't paying what they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| A lot of rich people weren't paying what they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| A lot of regular people weren't paying what they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| And if I can find it, certainly the assessor can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| There's a lot of revenue lost because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| I indicated to Mr. Sisk and Mr. Ballard that he ought to set up some type of a citizens group to check these things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:49| make sure their taxes are okay, you know, check them out first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| And have them go through and look at people, say, in the city government, whatever government you want to look in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4613)|
| 1:17:03| and I'm sure you'll find a lot of people that owe back taxes or taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:12| And one reason why I did this, I was sitting at the assessor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| and a good old boy, Zach Duncan, was taking care of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| And I heard another examiner talking to a friend of mine, and he wanted to raise his value of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:33| And, of course, my friend didn't want him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Well, he said, well, this is all, you know, I'll figure it out, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| You're going to pay a dollar more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| But what happens when he adds the valuation of $10,000, $15,000 onto that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| And what about the tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| It hadn't even been okayed by Nashville yet to go down to what they are predicting it will go down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| So the evaluation and what the guy was telling him was not correct as yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| And he also told him, he said, my friend asked him what happened if the tax rate went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| He said, oh, it'll never go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Well, you know, I don't believe that, and I don't think anybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| If the people keep writing checks like the Obama administration is doing now for things that we can't afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:29| then you're going to have to go back to the taxpayer, and you're going to have to get more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| So basically, that's what I said around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| I thought it was interesting to see you guys work, and like in church, I can go to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| But I couldn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| I was interested in what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| I appreciate you more, and I appreciate the chance to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| I hope you understand what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| And if you don't, you can call me at home, and I'll explain it to you, and I'll show you some of my research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| It might be one of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| I won't mention any names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| I think Mr. Ballard has inherited a problem, and I'm sure he's working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:17| except I don't agree with him the fact that he's hiring some girl from the East Coast, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| to come in here and make a map of, you know, red, white, and blue states or places that need looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:31| I don't understand exactly what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| But I'm sure if she brings the East Coast values into Knox County, I don't think it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| Well, thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Got any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| No questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4783)|

| 1:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Do we want to go right on in, or do people want a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| Break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4797)|

| 1:20:54| I'm sure we may pick up a few as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| We're on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Mr. King, if you'll identify yourself by name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| I'm John King, PO Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| Second item on zoning appeals is 1G09RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| Sanderson, I represent the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| I know Mr. Good is here and rather than keep him waiting, I told him last week, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| or maybe the week before, that I would be requesting postponement of this to the next meeting of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| and I would like to at this time postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| So you want to defer this until May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Was there any opposition here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| Anybody wanted to speak about the deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| Mike Good, 8317 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| I'm here representing the ball camp community, and I just simply have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| I'm not objecting the postponement, but since the NPC meeting that Mr. Sandard was denied rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| he has hired an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| The ball camp community has not hired an attorney, so I want to ask the commission for some advice, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| You can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Mr. Sanders has continued to operate a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| and he's actually increased the commercial activity on this site without any CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| It's his own agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| He's been operating the business for about four or five years there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| What can the community do to stop or halt this business until the proper zoning is acquired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| Buzz or Mark, would you want to address that or what kind of zoning does it currently have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| Maybe Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Grant Rosenboom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Well, I mean, I want to know what our current zoning is and whether or not it's a permissible use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| The current zoning on the property is ag, for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| Here's a small piece of RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| I'd hesitate to say exactly what he's doing right now is in violation of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| I think there may have been some discussion to that effect, but I think that is an enforcement issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| and would have to be looked at through that particular process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Grant, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| Sir, he's going to be right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| I've not been aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I don't have the file in front of me, but I'll be happy to talk to the gentleman and we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Sir, if you'll talk with Mr. Rosenberg there and he'll help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| So you don't have a problem with the deferral, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Without objection, we'll defer this until May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5031)|
| 1:24:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| We're back on page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5047)|

| 1:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5078)|

| 1:24:44| Mr. Chair, members of the commission, this is a request for rezoning from RA low-density residential to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5084)|

| 1:25:15| Proposed use is residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| In looking at the rezoning location, location of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| and also looking at the surrounding development pattern as well as characteristics of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| a lot went into the staff recommendation and then the staff recommendation in looking at what they recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5130)|
| 1:25:41| and then also what the planning commission voted to approve for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| The sector plan for this property is for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| There is some property that does include some slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| So all of this was taken into account in coming up with the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| and the eventual planning commission decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| The staff recommended and the planning commission supported the recommendation to recommend approval of plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Throughout the process of developing the recommendation and leading up to the planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| we had a couple of meetings with the applicant and the applicant's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| We mentioned to them some issues that staff has been dealing with with regard to a much larger effort regarding slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:32| ridge line protection throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| We noted that the applicant, based on comments from staff and findings from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| that the applicant really came forward to show us a potential development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:50| which he has submitted to MPC for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| a potential development plan that would go a long way to respect the physical constraints of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| He has also indicated on that potential development plan the desire to revegetate a good part of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:10| and also to preserve a lot of vegetation on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| So based on the fact that the -- and even though we weren't reviewing a development plan at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:24| but based on the fact that he was willing to go that far to really look at the site critically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:32| the fact that you do have a low-density residential development plan primarily to the west, east, and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| You do have some higher residential density in the area that's primarily to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| And the fact that under the current zoning, RA, single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| he could conceivably develop the property at least at the density that was approved by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5273)|
| 1:28:01| but at the same time do it in such a way that would really could do a lot of damage to that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| considering its topographic constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| So with all that in mind, all the information the staff gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| and the discussion that took place at the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| the commission did vote by a vote of 13-0-1 to approve planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| at up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Okay, John, we're going to give you five minutes and then we'll give the officer five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I'm John King, PO Box 2425 in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| Mr. Johnson has already talked about the fact that we were originally looking at a much more dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| It started out perhaps at above seven units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| We got down to 110 units at five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| Over the course of several months and meetings with the staff, Buzz and Dan Kelly and Ken Pruitt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| and Mike Carberry and others, we did as they suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| They wanted to see a development done in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| They were interested in seeing how it would be put on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| particularly in light of their having undertaken a study of hillside developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| It sort of became the experiment of the poster child for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| We went along with them on their request as to how this should look in being on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| and how to minimize as much as possible land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| The plan that we developed as a consequence of all that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| We even went to the point of getting a minor variance on parking stall size to get to the city's development standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:57| which, again, would help minimize land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| We spent a lot of time in dealing with Mr. Carberry's interest in reforestation and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| And, as I say, we sort of went back to the drawing board and we came up with a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:18| which is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| This is the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| John, if you'll just be sure to speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| This follows generally the contours of the property, taking into account, if you will, its terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| I'll pass it up in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| What we came out with is a total of 65 units in about 22 acres, which, when you do the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| it turns out to be slightly under three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| It's about 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| I would note that the woodlands on the north side of Cherokee Trail, just beyond Eddington Road, inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5452)|
| 1:31:01| was rezoned fairly recently at three-and-a-half units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| Across the street from us on Eddington at Cherokee Trail is, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| a development that's at about eight units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Immediately adjacent to us, it's seven-and-a-half units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| What I say to you is this represents the current interest in reducing density in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| and it also goes a long way toward addressing the issue about potential traffic questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| There was a traffic study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| The pertinent parts of it are at page three and other pages that support the conclusions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| The conclusion on that traffic study is that when the project traffic is added to the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| plus the background traffic at project build-out in the year 2011, both Eddington Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| and Cherokee Trail and the Eddington Road at the project entrance will continue to operate at acceptable levels of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| during both the a.m. and the p.m. peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| I know some of you may have heard about concerns over traffic in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and I'm not unaware of those expressions of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| I think we've gone a long way toward addressing that concern when we stopped talking about 110 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| and started talking about 65 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| I would just say to you that the traffic light that has been placed at Cherokee Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| and the entrance, if you will, to the UT Med Center, I'm told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| has done a lot to relieve a lot of problems about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| And I would ask that you consider that as you consider this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| As indicated, we spent a lot of time and a lot of effort with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| We appreciate the involvement of staff, and we did everything we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| and everything they asked us to do to comply with their desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| and what their interests were in developing property with terrain such as exists here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| What it all boils down to is the staff has said that this is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| This rezoning is consistent with the general standards for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| It's consistent with the adopted plans, both the general and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| It's in harmony with the general purpose intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| It's compatible with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| All of that was done when they, in fact, approved our use on review request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| which was submitted to MPC that shows this development plan that I just showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| which, as I say, was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| If this property is rezoned, planned residential at three units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| that's the development that will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| John, you've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| This development, we believe, is the, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| working example of policies for development of properties referred to as having hillside terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:16| It takes care of reforestation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| It has landscaping requirements and a minimum of land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| It is certainly less dense than many other developments in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| It's surrounded by RA and PR and, as already noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| an RA zone you can develop with 10,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| This proposal reflects, as I said, the current interest for reduced density in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| and, as such, likewise addresses the traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| I would appreciate your support for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| And opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| John, can you pass that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| I'd like to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5695)|
| 1:35:04| I'm Harry Watson, 110 Vista Lane in Seymour, 37865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| I'm here to represent UT Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Opposition may not describe exactly what I'm here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| Two things we want to say from UT Medical Center is, one, is that we support the recommendations of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| And secondly, we certainly don't, we're not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| We would like to continue to bring awareness to the traffic that we experience on a daily basis on Cherokee Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:37| Mr. King is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| The traffic light has made a miraculous improvement in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| However, we continue to still have difficulties every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| We have an officer at what we refer to as Old Cherokee Trail, which enters the back of our hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| And each morning from about 7.30 until 8.30 or quarter to nine, we have an officer there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| and that officer is stopping the traffic coming down Cherokee Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| If we did not have an officer there, five days a week, traffic would back up all the way to Buckharms Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| and frequently does, even if we have an officer who is slow to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| So, like I say, we're not here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| We just want to continue to bring awareness that this is a traffic-congested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| We realize that we participate in that traffic congestion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| That is why we agreed to participate in the payment of the, or to assist in the city to fund that traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| So, thank you for an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| Sir, if you'll just state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Gladly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| My name is Robbie Pope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| I'm on the Board of Directors of the Cherokee Bluff Council of Co-Owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| which is the homeowner's association for the condos that you can see there on the bluff next to UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| We also share Cherokee Trail as our primary access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| And I think what we, our opposition, there's 136 units there on over 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| and that's what differentiates our community from some of the ones that have come along later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| where they have that many units or more on 10 or 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| The impacts that these communities that are being added recently cumulatively is not being taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| Some of them are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Some of them are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| Yes, MPC has oversight over all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| But in several instances, the densities that have been approved have exceeded their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| Nearly all of these properties are heavily sloped, in some cases, you know, 20, 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| And I think in terms of saying that this is compatible with some of the uses that are adjacent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:59| I would suggest that those were mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| They may have had impacts that those who live around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| and have to travel around it in terms of the UT Medical Center employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| All of this is exacerbating that without any plan to address Eddington Road, Cherokee Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| and the interchange there at the hospital and Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| And we're basically just sliding down a slope where, you know, 60 more units here won't hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| and 30 more units there won't hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| But eventually you've got, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| and thousands of residents when you're talking three-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| and four-bedroom units, which is what all of these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| And the traffic impacts, I would suggest, are not always accurately reflected on these traffic studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:50| because with these new residents primarily being students, they may come and go three, four, five, six times a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:58| whereas a person who's just going to work and coming home, you know, twice or three times maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| So basically the traffic light at the interchange has improved the traffic there at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:12| but every time a new one of these developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| and there are several more that may come online with other parcels in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| the ability for that interchange even with the traffic light to function without extraordinary efforts by UT Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:28| is harmed and, you know, essentially it's a pretty dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| The improvements they made to that interchange are not what anyone would draw up unless they had no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:44| There are some dangerous spots for yielding and so forth and it does not function very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| The solution in terms of the Alcoa Highway interchange is probably ten years off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| You've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| I'll wrap up quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| But, you know, in essence, what we have is, yes, they have worked with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| and reduced the number of units that they're asking for, but in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| I believe that has resulted in them increasing the bedroom counts on the units that they're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| So I don't know if net bedrooms, you're really talking about a 40-plus unit decrease in the impact, the real impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:26| which is a resident and an automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Those impacts remain more closely correlated to what they were with the higher unit counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| So we would like to see, you know, if this development and others are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| this area needs to be moved up the list in terms of improvements to the infrastructure that are to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| And I would suggest that the developers, in every case that I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| all out-of-state developers who don't necessarily have an interest in long-term quality of life in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| after their last unit is sold, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| we would suggest that the priority for this area for traffic improvements needs to be increased as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:12| especially if additional developments like this are going to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| John, you get a three-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:39| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| I don't want to get this wrong, but I believe, and I don't know how it worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| and how we ended up with 100 acres at Cherokee Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| but when Cherokee Bluff was originally done, it was zoned at up to six units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:04| I'm talking about less than half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| I'm talking about less than the city rezoned a piece of property that is on Cherokee Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| That's, you know, less than a half a mile away on the north side of Cherokee Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| within the last couple of three years at three-and-a-half units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| We're at 2.83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| About the traffic, let me say this, that the trip generation estimates that were used in the traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:36| assumed that a number of persons having a correlation to the number of bedrooms involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| and that each bedroom, if you will, represented a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| and that each one of those persons would have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| They took all that into account in putting together the traffic analysis that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| And I can tell you that, and I'm going to put that traffic study into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| It's sort of lengthy, but the data is all there, and that both of the intersections that I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| that is the intersection to our development or the intersection that occurs as a result of our entrance onto Eddington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:18| and the Eddington Road-Cherokee Trail intersection both operate at acceptable levels of service in both a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| and p.m. peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| And that's, I believe the levels go from like A through E or F or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:35| but on all of that, on this, they're operating at levels A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| And I understand UT's situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| but I would simply observe that I've lived in South Knoxville for many, many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| and traveled to and from Blount County frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| And, you know, despite whatever you may do, there are, on occasion, traffic loads created by certain kinds of activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6235)|
| 1:44:03| and they have a shift change over there, and I understand that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| Alcoa Highway, the most heavily traveled non-interstate roadway probably in, certainly in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:17| if not maybe the entirety of the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| On Sunday mornings, you have officers who have to stop traffic to let severe heights, Baptist Church people, get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:28| It's unfortunate, but it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| There cannot be an absolutely perfect situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| I think, as I say, we've addressed the problem by minimizing our number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| We will continue to be involved in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Three minutes has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| I just told them one minute, so I ran it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| This developer is not going to be selling out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| They will remain in ownership and possession and will have their own management company leasing out the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| I would appreciate support for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| And Opposition, you're allowed three more minutes if you so wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Ninth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I've talked to several people on Eddington, which is his own, Chestnut, and Spruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| These people are for that because they feel like this is an asset to their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| It's really a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| It makes their property worth more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| They're elated with the condos that they built up there on Cherokee Trail, the apartments, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| If you go by and look at them, they're really an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| So I'm going to make a motion to approve this MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| And that's up to three units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| I'd just like to add a couple of comments if I can here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| I've kind of watched that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Being on MPC before and working with some of the neighborhood groups, sometime back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| and above you could probably tell me how many units are in the latest one they're grading for there now that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:18| west of the intersection of Eddington and Cherokee Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| They're just grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| That's one on the north side of Cherokee Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| But while you're looking at that, before that, there was 1,100 units right there within a stone's throw of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:42| 1,100 units translates into a lot of trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| My concern is that Cherokee Trail there, there's absolutely no way unless you're driving a scooter that you want to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:57| Cherokee Trail toward Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| Anybody with a large-sized car probably wouldn't make it down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Coming out there toward UT Hospital, it's a little better, but it's narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| There's drop-offs, big ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| And from what I understand, there are three or four more pieces of property down through there that comprise several acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:24| that probably will be up before MPC and us before too long for additional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:33| All this before something is done about the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| Somewhere along the way, those that put in the developments are going to have to share in the infrastructure cost somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:49| I don't know how or what we can do about this, but this is becoming a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| This one, Mr. King's in this case, is not going to be as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| It's on the other side of the hill, which half of his folks there could very well come down and go out through Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:06| or through, what's the one that goes the other way, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| Maryville Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Before you go under the underpass, take a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| Willoughby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| They go Willoughby Road down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| So they'll have more of an option than others on that particular hill would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:27| But that hill is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Believe me, it's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| And I just think that before we, you know, start doing a whole lot more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| we need to be looking at something that would be improving the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| Yes, Mr. Polk, you know, with the new U.T. development over there, I'm sure that there's going to have to be a new ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:53| or intersection designed there at U.T. Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| It desperately needs it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| I don't think it can wait ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| So my concern is that, you know, we're going to have to start working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| and we're going to have to start working on it soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| Commissioner Heyman, you did have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Did you have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Buzz, you mentioned some of the things that the developers are trying to do to meet the constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:30| obvious physical constraints of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Could you get a little more specific, especially in terms of slopes, severe slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| and describe some of the things that they are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| One of the things that they did, they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| and I believe it's a departure from an initial plan that we saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| and I don't recall that plan specifically, and I don't have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| But they really took pains to locate their units that follow the topo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| They don't go against the topography of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| They follow the topography of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| And they're all situated up on the top side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| So, you know, that was something that we appreciated them doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| And we said, well, if they do that, then we've got something to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| They also, in looking at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| realizing the fact that they were going to disturb some land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| that they were going to retain that slope feature around just below the units that they were proposing to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:41| plus the fact that they were going to establish a fairly significant revegetation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| as well as commit to saving some of the property or saving some existing vegetation on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:59| So the staff was very pleased that they were willing to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| and through the submission of their development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| follow up with actually doing what they said they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| And it's the kind of thing that we want to, I believe, see happen once we get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| where we establish some policy with regard to slope protection, ridge line preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| So, you know, take, and there you see a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| What you see there is with what they're, even with what they're disturbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| they're maintaining that gradient, that slope around following that serpentine roadway there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6695)|
| 1:51:44| and then also incorporating the vegetation and the conservation of existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| some of the existing vegetation on the lower parts of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| On the, there was mention of revegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| What types of revegetation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| They're showing a variety of both deciduous and pine trees, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:19| They're showing a variety of major trees to incorporate onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Is there, are there any of the, if we'd say slope protection area, you're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| if we say that technically that's over 20 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| Twenty-five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Twenty-five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Well, actually 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| The more critical parts get over 25 percent, but we start looking at slope protection at 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| The more critical parts are 25 percent and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| So do they have in their concept plan cuts into those types of steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| They do in some locations, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| But where they are cutting into those slopes, they're not taking those slopes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| They're reshaping so that that essential slope feature will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| Now, they will have to revegetate those slopes, but they're proposing to do that in a very significant way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Okay, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Motion on the floor is to approve per MPC recommendation, which is up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Got one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Any other no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Motion passes 16-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| Next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| The next two items are requests of Donald D. Hollyfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| 2A-09-SP is a request for a northwest county sector plan amendment from LDR, low-density residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:53| to MDR, medium-density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| 2A-09-RZ is a request for rezoning from A agricultural zone to PR plan residential zone at 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:06| They're located northeast and west sides of Wood Smith Road, south and east sides of Barnard Road in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:16| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr. here on behalf of the property owner and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| And is there any opposition here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| I do have a couple of names, a Karen Rader and an Alan Contrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| So what we'll do is we'll start out again with MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, you have two requests before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| A sector plan amendment requesting that the sector plan be amended from low-density residential to medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:58| and a rezoning application requesting that the zoning be changed from agricultural to plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| and the submission considered by the planning commission was for 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| Property is located on the northeast and west sides of Wood Smith Road, south and east sides of Barnard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| Approximately 11.5 acres is included in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| Access is via Wood Smith Road, a minor collector street, and you also have access possibly by Barnard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:31| The planning commission, in looking at the staff report as well as testimony at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| noted that there is, in the surrounding area, you do have, let me turn to that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:54| a wide range of zoning and densities all the way from plan residential, 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6954)|
| 1:56:02| which is primarily north of this site, to agricultural zoning and in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| primarily a low-density residential development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| They did note the staff concerns with regard to some drainage issues on the site as well as some possible access issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:21| which, of course, regardless of the zoning under plan residential, would be addressed at the site plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| But they did note this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| They did note the surrounding development pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| but they also noted the fact that it is in close proximity to plan residential at 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| a good part of which is already developed with some attached development primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:48| So in looking at that, in looking at the staff recommendation, which was to approve five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| deny the MDR request but approve or recommend that you approve rezoning at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| They recommended approval of the medium-density residential, but recommended approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| recommend that you approve plan residential zoning at up to 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| There were also two conditions with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| No clearing and grading of the site shall occur prior to use on review concept plan approval by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:25| and development shall be limited to townhomes of no more than two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| Okay, Arthur, you can give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| Of course, you're going to get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| The opposition will get five minutes, and then we'll have a three-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| We had a fairly lengthy discussion of this issue at the last commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| and Mr. Humphreys was here and asked for a postponement, I think was how it was phrased, or further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7075)|
| 1:58:05| The commission postponed this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| Since then, Mr. Holifield, the property owner, Mr. Sood, the developer, Mr. Holifield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:18| and Commissioner Harmon and Commissioner Norman and I met to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| And I don't want to speak for Mr. Humphreys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| but I think he is in support now of 9.75 units per acre subject to the two conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:34| which MPC has already imposed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| And the additional request, and this really isn't a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| but since it is planned residential, we will have to come back with a concept plan if the zoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| that we work with him on issues regarding improvements to Woodsmith Road, which everyone agrees are badly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7132)|
| 1:59:03| The third district, I understand from our discussions with commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| will be requesting some funding from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| And Mr. Humphreys, who is a licensed engineer, will be working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| and the county on improvements to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| As I mentioned last month, and as Mr. Johnson just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| Mr. Sood and his father before him have been developing property in that area for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| This property lies to the southwest of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| Woodsmith Road connects in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| As you can see from the diagram, there will be basically three phases to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| Phase one, which will continue where Sood Road ends now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7189)|
| 2:00:01| Traffic from that point will probably go Sood Road back to Raj Road to Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| Those are first class streets that Mr. Sood and his father have built there for their earlier townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:14| and single family homes development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| The improvements are going to be critical when phases two and three are built, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:25| And that will require improvements to the intersection of Woodsmith Road and Bernard Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| and further improvements on a hill on Woodsmith Road that will require improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| All of these will be done in conjunction with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| There has been some preliminary discussion with Knox County Engineering about the road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| Mr. Holifield's family has already dedicated rideways over 20 years ago for improvements at Woodsmith Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:57| and Bernard Road, which have not yet been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| But typically improvements are done when development occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| and the developer is asked to participate, which we fully anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| We would point out that this property, the two-family or the two-story townhouse homes that Mr. Sood had built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7270)|
| 2:01:20| have been very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| This is in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| It's not within the boundaries of the city of Knoxville, obviously, or you wouldn't be hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| But it is very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| We ought to encourage development at a higher density where we can within the urban growth boundary of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| rather than going further out and taking farms and putting subdivisions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| This is an extension as Mr. Johnson pointed out of an existing townhouse development that Mr. Sood has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7308)|
| 2:02:00| that has built out at about ten units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| We're asking for 9.75 here with the conditions I have mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7324)|
| 2:02:14| And with that, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:26| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Now, we have two people that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| Are you speaking on behalf of both you and Alan Contrail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| No, I think we both wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| Well, we do have to divide up the five minutes between the two of you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| So if you'll just give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| My name is Karen Rader, 2514 Woodsmith Road, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| And my property is right next to Mr. Hollifield's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| And I have talked to everyone in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| No one is in favor of the townhouses going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| It is a single family unit in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:17| And it's not in keeping with the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| And the property, the townhouses he already has, are kind of, like, out of sight and in behind the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| And really, almost no one knows they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| And Woodsmith goes right in the middle of these three areas that he's wanting to put these in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| And the traffic, like I said, the traffic is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| And I have a petition, the signatures of everyone but one whose property borders Mr. Hollifield's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:51| And this gentleman said he was going to e-mail Mr. Norman and Mr. Harmon in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| And I have signatures of everyone who lives up and down the street who will be affected with the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| except one person, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| And the traffic is so heavy now, we don't need any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| And, like one person said, I mean, this road was paved, like, 50 years ago over a gravel road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| And the people had so much trouble getting out of the driveways now because of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| and how fast everyone drives on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| And there's just been a lot of accidents over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| And, like I said, no one that I have talked to in the neighborhood wants the townhouses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| because it just does not fit in with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| And I'll let Mr. Cantrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| My name is Alan Cantrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| I live at 6213 Ellesmere, which is adjacent to the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| There was some mention of some water problems or drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| That happens to be on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Every time it rains, we get a foot of water on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| The intersection in question is absolutely a treacherous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| The only way to improve this intersection is to build a four-lane highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| with as many units as want to be built on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| In our neighborhood, some of the homeowners have chosen to rent their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| Since a lot of the homes are rented, our crime rate has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| There was a stabbing on the school bus that my children was a witness to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| A police officer just last year was shot in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| My children were so close they heard the gunshots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| With this many units going up on this property, our crime rate will not double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| It will triple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| On top of all this, there are units around Barnard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| There's apartment buildings on Ball Camp and Western that are dying for renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:10| Why do we need all these townhomes when we have so many vacancies already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:18| One on Western is even advertising free rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| It's, like I said, you cannot improve the traffic in this area for as many townhomes as want to be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7583)|
| 2:06:32| Barnard is barely wide enough for one vehicle, much less two as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| If you improve it to accommodate this many townhomes, you're going to have to put almost a four-lane highway through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:47| I disagree with all the traffic that will be going from there to Rodge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| All this traffic will be going from Woodsmith to John May to Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:59| So this directly affects all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| We highly oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| Our property values have already hit rock bottom since the economy has gone bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| You build condominiums here, our property values are going to take a bigger hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| And yet our property taxes keep going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| I guess that just about covers everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| If anybody has any questions, I'd love to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| Well, sir, we're going to go back to them for a three-minute rebuttal, and then you can come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| And so can Ms. Rader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| Mr. Chairman, this is the third public hearing on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| We had the MPC public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| We've had one here at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| We did not know that Ms. Rader was concerned about the project until within the past three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7672)|
| 2:08:01| Mr. Soot, back Friday, found out she was circulating a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| She never contacted he or Mr. Holifield or Mr. Humphreys, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| He contacted her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| Basically, I think she indicated she was opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| You met with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| Anything happening there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| You want a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| Which certainly would complicate the situation far worse because you would have a number of driveway entrances there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| without any planning that the planned residential zone requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| That is, this zoning does not give the applicant the right to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7719)|
| 2:08:47| until he submits a plan to the planning commission, which is reviewed by the health department, TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7727)|
| 2:08:55| the engineering department, and a number of other agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| and which will require public improvements by the developer before anything goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| With single family residential on ag zoning, none of that will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| So the best thing that can occur for this property out there is to go with the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| at the density requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| And you've got two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| Well, now one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| As Mr. Seymour pointed out, we did meet with Ms. Rader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| We need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| Raj Sood, 2728 Sood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| We did meet with Ms. Rader on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| Don Holyfield and I did at my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| We did attempt to address all her concerns, drainage, noise, landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7792)|
| 2:10:01| What else was there, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| And I'll save the rest of my time for Don, but we did address all her concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| I think she just said on single family construction, and that's what we're proposing for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| So the remaining time, Don Holyfield would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:23| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| I'm Don Holyfield, 1301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| I need to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Don Holyfield, 1301 East Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| I met with Ms. Rader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| I went back to her as I called her after I found out that she had filed a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| And I wanted to put her, as Mr. Norman says, in the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| So I met with her and discussed this situation and what we were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| I even gave her drawings of the intersection and a deed that I had proposed to the county, you know, 27 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7849)|
| 2:10:57| Now, her comeback when I first talked to her was she had wanted no change whatsoever to that area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:05| She wanted to leave it as is and make it single family residential, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| I proposed to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| I said, well, why don't you buy my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| You do what you want to do with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| I don't mean to be cynical, but I did say that to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Sir, you've got only about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| I've said what I want to say, but I appreciate your support to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| Opposition, you've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Ms. Rader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| I did not tell Mr. Holyfield we wanted the property to stay as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| We told him we would not be opposed to single family houses going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| They could put as many houses as you can put on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| And he had not contacted me before this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| and I didn't realize you had to contact the person when you had a petition started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| because everyone in the neighborhood wanted to do something to try to get their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| And he told me when I met with him that when they built the subdivisions there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7924)|
| 2:12:11| and when he lived there, he fought tooth and toenail to try to keep those from coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| But he doesn't live there anymore, and we don't mind houses whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| We just don't want these apartments right in the middle of our residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| And he seems to think we don't want him to sell his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| but he can sell his property just for the right kind of usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| And like the traffic is one of the main situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| but just the fact that it will not fit in with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| Mr. Contrell, you've got about two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| I just wanted to agree with her totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| If you want to build homes here, we have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| In fact, that would absolutely do nothing but bring the value of our homes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| But if you build apartments around there, our crime rate, our traffic, our property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:07| everything goes downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| I have no problem with anybody selling their property for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| If you can't get enough for selling it for residential home bill, then get another offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| Putting that many apartment complexes or that many units in such a small area, confined area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| and with roads as treacherous as they already is, you're asking for trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| We have a third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| Well, first of all, let me say we did have a meeting a couple weeks ago with Arthur Seymour and Raj| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| and Mr. Humphreys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| And we all come to the conclusion that if we work together on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| we get the county to work with Bruce Wheatridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| And I feel like with the teamwork that we're going to work on, this road will be repaired and fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| And if you look around this neighborhood, there are other apartments and other condos in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| And I don't see that this is not out of character to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| And I'll let Tony say something and I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| This is another difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| It's a very densely populated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8061)|
| 2:14:29| If I had my way, I would say that this doesn't need to be developed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8069)|
| 2:14:36| It's a forested track with a steep slope on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| The top of the hill is not visible from anywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| but it would be a great place for this to be an area for the residents around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:54| around the proposed site to have some open space, you know, and have some forested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| I wish Knox County had the money to buy it at Mr. Holifield's price and we could put it aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:09| We don't have that and we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| What we've tried to do is reach a point where he can profit from the reasonable use of his land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8112)|
| 2:15:20| as we call the reasonable use of his land, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| and simultaneously give the developer an option for density so that he can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:33| And then hopefully also the controls that are in place from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| and that process in terms of planned residential along with other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:46| I hate to use my little laser pen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| The part of the property, there's several very challenging pieces here for Mr. Sood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8151)|
| 2:15:59| And one of the pieces, where did we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| The other map, Joey, the one you had up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8165)|
| 2:16:22| Yeah, the one that had the concept on it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| Okay, so can you pull it a little higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| So you can see this road right here is a very steep slope this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| The forested area that's very steep this way, there's drainage issues down here, probably a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| There is a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| Then on this part, there's potentially, I don't know whether it's defined to be a sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| but there's some definite drainage issues, at least a depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| What we call a depression there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| The area that's easiest to develop would be this area in my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:12| All in all, it's going to be a very challenging thing for Mr. Sood to pull off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:21| And what we tried to do being, you know, I'm trying to kind of tree hugger kind of guy on here, one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:29| And the idea was to give higher densities to allow Mr. Sood to be less intensive in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:43| and more intensive in this area and this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| And so that was the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| I hope that that, you know, I'm hopeful that our processes, our controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| the MPC processes that we have to go through will allow that to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8276)|
| 2:18:03| And that, indeed, that road will get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| It's a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| It's an incredibly dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| I probably haven't been on a more dangerous little road than that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:18| And so those are why we're doing it, why I'm going to go ahead and say to support it at the level that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8298)|
| 2:18:30| recommended, 9.75, but it's a difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| And I'd like to introduce that as a motion to go with 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| And, again, let's remember that, you know, when people start moving in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| they're going to make improvements to the road as is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| And I think we've committed, me and Tony both have committed to getting the county to help us as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| Once these developments come in, we're going to improve that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| And that motion is for both items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| 9.75 for both of them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| One's a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| We've got to remember, there is going to be a concept plan come back before this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| before anything can be done, he has to bring a concept plan back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| So, you know, we've got some other ways of making sure this stuff works out right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:26| So you're asking that the sector plan be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| No, it's to, instead of it saying 7.5, he's wanting 9.75 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| So it's not necessarily per NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8375)|
| 2:19:42| And the sector plan, yeah, he just needs medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8382)|
| 2:19:51| So that would be as it is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| Medium density goes up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| It's from 5 to 12, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| Is that right, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| It's, yeah, the recommended, if you choose to go 9.75, that would be covered by the medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:10| So we can do the sector plan as per NPC recommendation, but on the zoning, you want to change the 7.5 to 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| And we do have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| Who is a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| Commissioner Smith or Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Commissioner Lambert, you're the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| Tony wants to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Commissioner Norman has seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| We've got a few lights on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| Last term, I was just going to ask very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| These have been referred to as condos and referred to as apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| Is the intention to have these as rental units or is the intention to sell these as owner-occupied condominiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8454)|
| 2:21:02| They would be rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| This would be a continuation of the project, which had been two-story townhomes that had been rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:12| Very well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| They're by an in-town person who has continued to manage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| I'd like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| I did meet with Ms. Rader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| She was concerned about that she had heard these were low-income units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Our three bedrooms rent for $975 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| These people are basically the same socioeconomic level as many of the people that live on Woodsmith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| Concerning crime, I understand that the gentleman's concerned that they probably have people that rent individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8496)|
| 2:21:41| single-family homes on Ellesmere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| They don't do any type of criminal or credit check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| We require a criminal check for everyone that moves in on a national database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| Our tenants are the same really outstanding socioeconomic group as other people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8510)|
| 2:21:58| They can pay almost $1,000 a month in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| They're built as townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| They could be condos in the future, but their project started as a rental project, partly because of the steepness of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| It's just not a people want to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| They want to have more yard around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| The steepness of the topography lends itself to a rental project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| It's been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| We put those roads in in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| It's not going to be built overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| We're going to build one building at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| The market has shifted down where people actually have to have a job and some savings to buy a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| What a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| So people are going to â younger people are going to have to rent now like it used to be when many of you guys were young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| and save up their money and buy a home so they don't just buy a home and walk out after six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| So I think there will be a demand for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| And we have total controls where no criminal will be allowed to live there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Mr. O'Leary, can we get the map that was up there at first, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| I don't have a laser pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| I don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:14| Stay seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| Or pass it on to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| Mr. Seymour, back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| Back up two pages, please, Joey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| Mr. Seymour, on the one that has the water in it and the one just to the bottom right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| are those going to be the heavy density and then the larger one smaller, lower density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| The one straight at the bottom there, if you take â| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| The one that dead ends into Sud Road, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| Basically, the left half of that will be undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| At the bottom, there will be one row of townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| Just one row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| One row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Twenty â 18 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Eighteen units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| This is very preliminary, but this is what â| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| I'm just trying to get a feel for what you're going with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| And the others, the other two tracks, which will probably be phase two and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| will be the heavier developed units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| What type of road improvements are you considering for Wood, Smith and Bernard there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| Don't have a traffic study as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| That will come with a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| There is, going sort of northeast, a problem with a hill on Wood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| Smith Road that needs to be brought down, not only for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:38| but for the safety of homes that have driveways that come in and out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| Down on the Ellesmere End or back toward Wood, Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Going towards the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| Going towards John May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| And that intersection where Wood, Smith, Bernard and all of them come together, that definitely needs treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| I think there have been several theories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| but I'm going to defer to the traffic engineer on how that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| But you are open to being accommodating on some improvements on that in your site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:13| We feel certain we will be required to participate in improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| Mr. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| I just want to say that last month when we all met, there were some heated exchanges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:31| and we asked you all to go meet and take a little time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| and none of you were very optimistic that anything productive would come of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| And I just want to congratulate you all for taking the time and meeting together with Commissioners Harmon and Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:48| And I'm glad to see that you all have been able to work all this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| Thank you very, very much for your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| Seeing no other lights, does everybody understand what's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| So we're going to approve on the sector plan, medium density as per MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8764)|
| 2:26:10| and on the rezoning, changing the 7.5 to 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| I believe that's the motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| Everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8779)|

| 2:26:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| Any other no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| 17-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| The next item is 2-M-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8794)|

| 2:26:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| I wish to thank all the commissioners here for your diligence and for the fact that I called all of you on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8799)|
| 2:26:48| and talked to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| I really appreciate you hearing what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| And good luck, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| Thank you, Mr. Hollowfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| Next items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| The next item is 2-M-09-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| Request of Brian T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Campbell for rezoning from PR plan residential zone to A agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| The property is located southeast side of Millertown Pike, northeast of Ellis Town Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8828)|
| 2:27:16| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| And is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| We have a per MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| Per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| The next item is 3-B-09-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| Request of South Heights and Artela subdivisions for rezoning from RB general residential zone to RAE exclusive residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:50| The property is located northeast and southeast sides of Brown Road, southeast of Sims Road, northwest of Artela Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| Basically, I think it was the whole subdivision, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| They were really dependent on MPC to carry this ball for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| Kind of like a class action item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:19| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| Is that a good word, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| Well, Buzz, typically we've got to have the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| I mean, we attempted to get a hold of the man that appeared to be the point person on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:39| and was not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| I'd like to remind him that he probably should be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| We don't recall that we were trying to think back to the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| We don't recall that anybody was there to discuss the item there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:54| But because I guess the feeling was there was so much support for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8934)|
| 2:29:00| But I did try to get a hold of the applicant today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| It was not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| Buzz, exclusive residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| Are we talking about a gated community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| Or what's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| You just have a lot more restricted uses for the property other than just RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| This is RAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| And it's almost exclusively residential, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| But the list of uses that you can use on the RA property is a lot less than what you can do under RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8963)|
| 2:29:32| Under RAE, it's a lot less than what you can do under the RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| Buzz, is this the lot at Police Property Lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| This is the one on Fontaine Road there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| The lot that y'all voted to condemn today is actually in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| That's what this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| Well, now, they called me and asked me if they need to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| And I told them they didn't need to come for the blighted part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| I don't know whether they meant this zoning or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| So it was non-controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| I do remember it from the NBC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| It was non-controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:08| And the neighborhood, again, it just puts more restrictions on the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| It's the whole neighborhood that's for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| If we could vote to suspend the rules because it's a commission rule that we need an applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| So do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| The motion is to suspend the rules so we can vote on this without an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| Do I hear a motion from the 9th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| Yeah, I'd like to take a moment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| I think, you know, everyone knows that the zoning we did just a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| there was some pretty passionate debate last month that I was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| Me and Mr. Humphreys, you know, were a little passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:08| We got a little passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| And I just want to apologize to him if in any way these zonings, that's an issue with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:18| I get really passionate about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| And if my passion was in any way mistaken for any kind of hostility, I want to publicly apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:27| I think you're a pretty passionate person as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| And, you know, I just, like I said, I don't want you to take my actions last month as hostility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| It was just passion for Mr. Hollifield and for his zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| I accept your apology, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| And like you said, you are a passionate man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| And just like I am, you were fighting on one side and I was fighting on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| You have a good day, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9110)|
| 2:31:51| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| And feel free to come here any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| And I also want to speak to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| He and I have had some pretty passionate debate at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| Same apology goes to Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| And I also want to really applaud what he did with that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9123)|
| 2:32:08| Instead of just opposing it, he used his opposition as leverage to help preserve some green space and woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9128)|
| 2:32:16| And I think for centuries to come, those woods will be protected because of this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9136)|
| 2:32:24| And I think you did a great job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| And I hope so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| I hope that it does work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9149)|
| 2:32:30| And certainly we'll be watching this process as it goes through and trying to ensure that some of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9150)|
| 2:32:37| some of these areas are preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| Clerk, we have another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| The zoning request is 3-C-09-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| And it's a request of Rebecca Ann Stewart for rezoning from I Industrial Zone to RA Low Density Residential Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9173)|
| 2:32:59| The property is located northeast side of Beverly Road, northwest of Greenway Drive in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9179)|
| 2:33:05| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| Right over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| Seeing none, 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| Move to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| Page 20, Rezoning Appeal 1-D-09-RZ is an appeal by Blue Sky Investments of MPC's denial of rezoning from RA Low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:41| Density Residential Zone to CA General Business Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| The property is located on the southeast side of Lowell Road, southwest side of Hickey Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9225)|
| 2:33:53| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| And we do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| Buzz, you'll give MPC a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, this is a request on an appeal of Blue Sky Investments for consideration of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:13| The current zoning of the property is OA Low Density Residential and the requested zoning is CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:19| I might add that this is a situation where the planning commission denied the corresponding sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9259)|
| 2:34:28| which was for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9268)|
| 2:34:31| That did not reach you on appeal because that is, as we have determined here fairly recently in the last several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9271)|
| 2:34:39| that is under the purview of the planning commission to approve or deny amendments to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9279)|
| 2:34:46| the sector plan being a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| So what you have before you is only the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| The property is located on the southeast side of Lowell Road at the intersection of Hickey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9292)|
| 2:35:03| If you look at your zoning map, you can see the only commercial zoning that you have in the area is up toward where Lowell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9303)|
| 2:35:11| comes into Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| So in looking at the request, I believe the gentleman was using his property for his general miscellaneous sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:27| I believe he may have been cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| Proposed use was continue to use it for uses under the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| Lowell Road is a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| However, one of the things you look for is to have commercial try to locate that at major road intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9335)|
| 2:35:43| and this would not be one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| Again, the surrounding development pattern is clearly predominantly single family development under low density residential densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9347)|
| 2:35:58| You have plan residential one to four dwelling units per acre, RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| You do have some what appear to be attached units at one to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9362)|
| 2:36:08| but they're down on down to the south, and their access is not to Lowell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| So with all these factors in mind, the staff recommended denial, and the planning commission supported the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:25| recommendation again to also deny the sector plan amendment, and then to recommend denial of CA general business zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9385)|
| 2:36:34| Before we get any further abuzz, since MPC has already denied the sector plan, is there really anything we can do as far as the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9394)|
| 2:36:47| I mean, even if we approved the applicant's request without having the sector plan, can we even proceed on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9407)|
| 2:36:58| The one thing you obviously can do is to deny the request for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9418)|
| 2:37:04| If there is another sense that you want to do something else, I believe you have to initiate the plan amendment that has to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9424)|
| 2:37:12| to MPC for reconsideration as I believe a new application, a new request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| So even if we approved the zoning request, we would have to also ask that MPC relook at the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:30| Yes, sir. You could not approve the rezoning unless you ask MPC, initiate a request back to MPC for consideration of a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9450)|
| 2:37:40| So we would have to actually do two steps, not just one. That's before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| Because before us tonight, right now, is the appeal of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| So any motion to approve the zoning would also have a corresponding motion to ask MPC to approve a new sector plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9471)|
| 2:38:04| Only if we approve the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| If we approve the zoning, it wouldn't do them any good unless we ask for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| I don't know that you could approve the zoning tonight. You would have to initiate the plan amendment back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9491)|
| 2:38:17| So we can't even approve the zoning. The only action we can do is ask MPC to reconsider the sector plan and then the correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9497)|
| 2:38:25| You would be initiating your request for MPC to consider commercial zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| Mr. Chairman, let's back up even further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| Over the last year, somewhere along through here, we've had discussions about the Metropolitan Planning Commission coming to us with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9515)|
| 2:38:45| and this recommendation being a denial, and whether or not we, sitting as county commission, have the right to even review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9525)|
| 2:38:54| I'd like to ask the law director to sort of look at where we've come from and where we might be tonight before we really get down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9534)|
| 2:39:03| Now, what I'm asking is not about the merits of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| I'm trying to make sure that I know where we as commission can deal and how we can deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| and then we'll speak to the merits of this one particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| I believe, Commissioner, your question goes to sector plans and what is the power of the commission as regards sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9561)|
| 2:39:29| Some time ago, we had this discussion after Chancellor Fansler rendered a decision under prior law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9569)|
| 2:39:39| and he held that MPC had the sole ability to amend a sector plan, and their decision was final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9579)|
| 2:39:49| Since then, the legislature has amended the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| There's been a change in the law, and that's what Buzz was talking about in terms of how sector plans can be amended now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9593)|
| 2:40:03| and an amendment to a sector plan can originate with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:09| It can also originate with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| If it originates with commission, I believe that's what you were referring to, was it not, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| If commission could initiate a request to go to MPC, they would consider it and come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9619)|
| 2:40:25| So the law has changed in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:29| So this body can now act with some degree of comfort with sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9629)|
| 2:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| So you do see what I'm questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| It's just a question on the issue of how we deal with sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9643)|
| 2:40:49| It has nothing to do with the merits of this request right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:57| Commissioner Lambert, did you have something you wanted before we get into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| I'd like to ask the applicant to come up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| Well, if that's the case, what we're going to do, if our questions are answered as far as what we can actually do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9665)|
| 2:41:10| we'll go into, we'll give each side five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| Well, this may nip it in the bud real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| If you'd like to ask your question, I'll allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9679)|
| 2:41:29| If you'll just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Frank Fusco, 1523 Andes Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9696)|
| 2:41:37| Frank, I mean, you know how I feel for your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| I believe that this property is not exactly suitable for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| But based on what's been there with your used equipment and refrigerator and filing cabinet store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9706)|
| 2:41:57| I'm not inclined to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| It takes a lot to get me to go against a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| And with your neighbor's fear of this turning into a Sanford and Son junk store, until their fears are alleviated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9724)|
| 2:42:15| I can't support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| Now, I don't know whether my not supporting it will cause it to be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| but I just think you should know that if it is denied, that this can't come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:30| Whereas if you voluntarily withdrew this application, you could start again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| and start with reaching out to your neighbors and trying to find some use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| that they wouldn't be so opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| So, what I'm asking you is, would you like to withdraw this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9762)|
| 2:42:48| so that you wouldn't have a denial on record that would keep it from coming back for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| Well, actually, Commissioner Lambert, before he answers that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| the MPC has already heard this and they have their one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9777)|
| 2:43:02| So, if he were to withdraw this tonight, would he still have to wait a year just to get back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| Before he answers, I just want to make sure that he's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| Well, it makes no difference then, a year to come back for the same zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| You might as well give it a shot then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| To be honest with you, I oppose it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| And I'll state my angle to that when I get up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9809)|
| 2:43:30| We'll just go right into it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| Sir, you have five minutes if you'll just give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| Did he get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| Mr. Spooner, he's on a BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:55| That's a picture of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| That's also a picture of some adjacent property that I live next to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| Now, here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| I talked to you guys last month a little bit, gave you some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| And I won't bore you with all the details again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| I'll just say that I've had this place for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| I lived there for like seven, eight, nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| I ended up finding another place and moved away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| In the meantime of living there, I got an education of what was going on with my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| and the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| In the meantime, I was also complaining to code enforcement about John Deere Landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| And they kept pretty much blowing me off saying they were grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| Which, here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| So I started thinking, well, if I can't beat them, I'll join them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| So I started kind of scumming up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| And it's actually a great piece of property for selling stuff off because all the traffic on level road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9883)|
| 2:44:48| So I shot myself in the foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| I started selling stuff off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| And it actually sold pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| So my neighbors got hostile, which is rightfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| And I'm not here fighting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| The property was not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| Now, I will say that when I bought the property, there was an old barn there, 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| There was an old farmhouse, 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| And it was actually blocking and impeding the sight of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| So it was actually a traffic nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| There was also an old barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| I actually tore all that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| I told you all that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| Cleaned up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| And it actually looked pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| So my neighbors have got to be happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| If they're not, they're insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| So anyways, I cleaned up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| But then I started messing it up again a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| So I found out that codes is not going to do anything against my neighbor, John Deere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| who's basically running a retail store and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| So I thought, well, if they can do it, I can do it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| So I started doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| In the meantime, I'm starting to get popped for codes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| Also, my neighbors started complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| Well, that's where the codes come from, because they're complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| So my neighbors complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| I get popped for codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| So I'm saying, well, why are you doing it to me if you're not going to do it to my neighbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| If you're not going to enforce the law with me, why aren't you doing it with John Deere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| Well, here's the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| There's actually no written policy in Knox County on what grants are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9961)|
| 2:46:07| I called you people and found out there was no written policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| So I had to go back to Tennessee state code, Tennessee statute, found the code saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9969)|
| 2:46:17| grandfather basically means that what they were doing when the codes were in place, they can continue to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| and they can grow what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| Anything beyond that, in excess of that, they have to go back and get zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9982)|
| 2:46:29| So what we've got, we've got a 20-acre neighbor that started out as a tree farm that's now doing 100% retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| Nothing's growing on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| It's a full-blown retail center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| I mean, just the two years that I lived there, they're selling, now they're selling lawnmowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| commercial lawnmowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| They're selling bobcats, skid steers on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| I mean, the place is a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| You can see by my picture that my mulch pile, their mulch pile is right next to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| They've actually moved their mulch pile closer to my property since I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| So I've got to put up with all the noise and all the noise and all the noise and all the noise and all the noise and all the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| I've got to put up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| I've got to put up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10019)|
| 2:47:08| Here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| They're in the process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| You guys are dealing with what's going on with the landscapers and what they're allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| You're kind of working through that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| I talked to Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| Grant pretty much agrees with me right now that they're not grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| In fact, they are doing illegal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| are doing an illegal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| And so his deal is that he wants to wait two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| before he does anything, as me as the complainant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| before he does anything to John Deere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| to get them to straighten up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| Because you guys are sorting out the property, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| Now, I feel like that I'm not going to get CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| That's insane for me to think that I'm going to get CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| That's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| What my solution to this is that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| can create on my property a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| because see, John Deere's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| going to figure out to do what they've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| I mean, they may have to clean up some stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| and I'm going to be keeping an eye on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| In fact, they may have to shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| I don't know, but that's not my goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| is to have them shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| My goal is to find the use of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| that works in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| Obviously, it's not going to work with CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| My neighbors are mad, and I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| But it might work OB, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| So what I recommend is that we move this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| recommend that they take a look at OB as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| Now, if you've got an OB property next to John Deere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| that's more of a subtle kind of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| And then my neighbors around me are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| going to be able to go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| And so it creates a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Now, having my property OB, I can put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| with what's going on with John Deere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| because I can get a little more value out of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| I'm having a hard time getting it rented right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| I've had it up for rent for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| I'm not getting any takers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| So my property is being hurt by what's John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| So what I'd like for you folks to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| is recommend that it goes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| They take a look at changing from CA to OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10142)|
| 2:49:07| to see if that'll make my neighbors happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| I'll be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| John Deere will be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| Everybody wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Now, one other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| He mentioned that there's no CA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| Can I have a little time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| You can just wrap it up for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| He said there's no CA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| But actually 900 feet from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| there is a property, the old Knoxville Marina, two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| If he can pull up the map, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| actually a CA property 900 feet from John Deere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| that you guys approved in 1993 for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| And then we've got down towards Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| we've got CB, which is the water utility company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| And they're only 700 feet from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| So don't kind of freak out that we're not kind of close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10191)|
| 2:49:59| In opposition, if you'll just introduce yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| I'm Robert Fagg, 10026 Noah Lane, Knox County, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| I'm a resident of Sherman Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| And I also am the president of Sherman Oaks Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10215)|
| 2:50:18| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| I'd like to have a small contingent of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10219)|
| 2:50:22| stand tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| Our complaint is not with John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| It's with Blue Sky Investments property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| across the street from our subdivision on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| We have 56 residents in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| There are 12 in Gray Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| We have a petition that's on record with at least 59| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10241)|
| 2:50:45| of both subdivisions in opposition of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10245)|
| 2:50:51| Now, it may be come to pass that this is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| to get denied regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| But hear this, that Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10256)|
| 2:51:02| is in opposition to any kind of commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| at this location or any change in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| reflecting commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| This is at our doorstep to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| It is directly across the street and almost across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| from Gray Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| This did start out as a codes complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| I wouldn't call it hostile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| Mr. Fusco was in violation of codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| And one of our neighbors filed a codes complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| And the subdivision homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| supported that complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| Since then, he filed for rezoning and a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| rezoned, which we opposed, went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| They researched this thoroughly and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| the site was barely adequate for a business, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| It's somewhere in the notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| If you read the notes, I could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| have told them what to write better than what they wrote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| what they found in their investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| We don't want any kind of business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| We have support of the Knox County Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:18| There's a letter on record from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| and the previous and current president of that association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| here in support of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| We just ask that you honor the MPC's findings, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| were 14 to 0 against any rezoning at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| that commercial business was not appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| It was residential when we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| When the subdivision was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| we wanted to remain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| It is true there was a goat company some distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| in a property enclosed in an agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| adjacent to us, which, frankly, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| glad to see that they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| And now there is a construction business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| which is somewhat benign because they are not a public business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| They have a driveway from Lovell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| that goes maybe a fourth of a mile back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| through the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| And they just have their own business coming and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| I think, mostly in the mornings and the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| In regard to John Deere and the agricultural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| that they are contained in, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| a very well-maintained, very well-landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10411)|
| 2:53:34| It's a business that's internal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| We have residents who are almost across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| from that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10420)|
| 2:53:41| I have heard no complaints from our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| about any odors or noise coming from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:47| They close up around 5 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10427)|
| 2:53:51| You've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10431)|
| 2:53:52| And they open up early in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| So I don't know what the issue is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| It seems like that's a separate issue from this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| But we want to go on record as opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10440)|
