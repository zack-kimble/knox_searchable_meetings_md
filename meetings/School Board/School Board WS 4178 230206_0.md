| 0:01:19| Mr. McMillan is feeling a little bit under the weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| so he will not be able to join us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Also, the Board met in an executive session at 430 today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| with representatives from the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Mr. Dupler, would you mind summarizing the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=92)|

| 0:01:42| Executive session is one of the few opportunities for the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| to have a closed session with its attorneys in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| The Board does not deliberate in any way during that session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Board members can ask questions of our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| and we do respond to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| We discuss both pending litigation and potential litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| and it's all pursuant to Smith v. Anderson County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=134)|

| 0:02:17| Also, in announcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| the Tennessee School Board Association is holding its legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| and legal institute in Franklin, Tennessee, on February 16th and 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=142)|

| 0:02:34| on matters important to public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| Also, just a reminder that these public meetings are the only opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| the Board has to discuss items that come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| We are glad you chose to attend tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| but please note that elevated noise makes it difficult for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| your neighbors, and those viewing from home to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| If you need to have a discussion with someone sitting next to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| please be respectful and courteous and step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| And with that, are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| So we have a motion to approve by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=189)|

| 0:03:22| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| We've had some brief updates since our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I would like to begin by highlighting three important events that happened in recent weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| On January 26th, I attended a celebration of the new academy's offerings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| for eight of our high schools as part of the 865 Academy's initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| On January 27th, I attended a Lunch and Learn meeting hosted by Ms. Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| and Mayor Jacobs that was focused on foundational literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| And on January 30th, I was part of a panel discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| about Knox County's effort to achieve 70% college or trade school attendance rate by 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| Each of these events focused on particular segments of our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| and I was very encouraged to see the strong community support of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| so thank you to everyone who was part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| At this time, I would also like to share some important information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| about a new effort that we are making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Under our district priority, Success for Every Student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| one of our core beliefs is improving outcomes for all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| through implementing research-based practices, operating with continuous improvement mindset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| and demonstrating vulnerability and willingness to objectively evaluate our current practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| As a staff, we have spent the last several months assessing several of our practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| processes, and protocols, looking for ways to improve outcomes for all KCS students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| We have reorganized our schools into a regional structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| and have more targeted input and support for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| We have reimagined high schools to transformational career-themed academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| through our 865 initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| We've launched a talent acquisition department to improve our system for recruiting and retaining talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| We've established robust community engagement councils that have expanded the voices at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| and helped us generate ideas for improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| and begun gathering data and input to create a five-year strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| to address the unique challenges of our schools in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Tonight, I want to announce our next step in this continuous improvement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| I have charged Jason Myers, the Assistant Superintendent of Student Success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| to take the next two to three months to take a deep dive into KCS practices, policies, and philosophies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| for special education, English language learners, and response to intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| to assess ways to improve our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| He will guide his team through this review and report back to the KCS Board of Education later this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| with some tangible steps based on this review to be implemented in the fall of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Let me be clear. I believe our special education and English language departments do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| However, as a district, we refuse to let good stand in the way of great for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| Over the next several months, Mr. Myers and his team will analyze data and gather input from surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| and regional focus groups, which will include families of students with 504s and IEPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| and families of students who receive services through English language learner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| and response to intervention departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| I look forward to the recommendations that Mr. Myers will bring this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Madam Chair, that concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you, Dr. Eiswit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Next up, we have our ESSA report, and I believe Ms. Kelly is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=382)|
| 0:06:43| Good evening, Madam Chair, school board members and Superintendent Risely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| We are always grateful for the time that you provide for us to give you all an update on our ESSA progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| So I'm going to start at a very high level to help you think about our allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| And then we're going to look at our allocations by KCS priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| And then we'll talk a little bit about our ESSA vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| And then we'll move on to some new things that we're doing around ESSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| So as some of you may recall, at the national, state, and local levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| there were allocations through ESSA 1, ESSA 2, and ESSA 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| And we will be focused on ESSA 3, and our allocation was $114 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| By KCS priority, you can see the breakdown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| And all of our ESSA work will always be done through the lens of our vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| which is to strategically use ESSA 3.0 funds so that all students across all schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| and all student groups will have access to the continuing support and tools needed to thrive in grade-level instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| to able them for success post-secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| So the last time that we were together, I talked a little bit about providing a link on the KCS website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| that would allow us to get feedback from community stakeholders in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| And so I'm sharing with you this evening the results of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| So we had 94 respondents, 4 responded but didn't complete the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| As you can see, about 76% of the respondents were parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| and followed by 24, almost 25% were certified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| About 14% identified themselves as concerned residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| and about 3%, almost 4% were classified staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| In terms of the breakdown, I may have to put my glasses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| I thought I could do this without my glasses, but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| So we asked which priority was most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| 35 respondents said educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Having great educators in every school was most important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| 25 respondents said that to them the most important priority was success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| 11 people identified excellence in foundational skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| and one respondent said that career empowerment was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| So that was a total of 72 out of 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| 22 of the entries did not identify a priority that was most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| and then be mindful of 4 people submitted responses that were incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| So as we transition to our updates from our priority owners by strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=566)|
| 0:09:35| I'd like for you to keep in mind we'll be sharing that out by each priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| And Superintendent Roswick mentioned continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| So in the spirit of continuous improvement, we're now going to be using a rating system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Green will mean on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Yellow will mean we have some concerns about that particular strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| Orange is not for the Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| It means at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| And red means that the strategy is off track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| And what I want you to hear me say is every strategy won't be green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| And when we come back in July, we may actually have some strategies that are orange or red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| But we are working in a culture of complete transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| And so we're not going to just show up and tell you everything is great when it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| We are going to talk, we're going to plan, and then we're going to pivot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| And then we're going to get the strategy back on track as we aim to spin down our ESSER allocation by September 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| So with that said, we're going to kick off the excellence and foundational skills with Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| You may not need my glasses, so I'll take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| I could probably use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| So you won't be hearing from me a whole lot tonight because I actually am backed up by a great team in the academics division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| And so we're actually going to start our excellence and foundational skills piece by hearing from Dr. Aaron Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| to talk to us a little bit about our work in ELA and mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| Good evening, members of the board, Madam Chair, Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I'm going to do a quick update for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| I'm going to try to be really concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| As you can see, we have three priorities that are green and one in the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| So I'm just going to briefly talk about each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| As far as ELA instruction expectations with high school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| we have focused our efforts on improving teacher empowerment with the use and knowledge of high quality instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| This year, we've intentionally focused on using protocols to help teachers internalize the backward design of the units and the ELA and take deep dives with the lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| And within those lessons, understand the structure and content in order to teach responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| And by that, I mean, be really knowledgeable about students and make decisions to respond to their needs in the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| As far as math, which is yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| The reason that is yellow is because we're currently in an adoption cycle and we have not purchased as of yet high quality instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=715)|
| 0:12:06| We do currently have some of those materials in classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| For instance, ready math is in our elementary classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| That is considered a high quality instructional material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| We do have some middle schools using Zurn, which is also a high quality instructional material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| However, it is consistent, inconsistent across K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| Because we are in the adoption cycle for math, we have this yellow until we've completed that adoption cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| We've worked through purchasing and we have materials in the hands of every math educator in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| As far as PD opportunities, which is listed up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| We have four cohorts working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| We have a total of 56 educators who are or will be engaged in this learning experience and then work to serve the district as literacy experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| As far as tutoring, we have elementary, ELA and middle school math tutoring to help students learn how to use the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| And we have a total of 50 educators who are or will be engaged in this learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| And we have a total of 56 educators who are or will be engaged in this learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| We have elementary, ELA and middle school math tutoring taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| We're providing a hybrid model to reach as many KCS students as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| We're serving students both during the day and during before and after school tutoring experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| We currently have 155 during the day tutors with an additional 10 requests to hire, which would put us at a total of 165 during the day tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=805)|
| 0:13:36| We also are currently serving 3,095 KCS students, a total of 2,721 during the day and a total of 374 students either before or after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=816)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| Is it okay if I keep Dr. Wilson's team together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| So Shannon Jackson is going to come up and talk to us about our career empowerment and preparation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| As you can see on the on the board, we are mostly in the green on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Credit recovery has been a system that we've had in place and we're continuing to run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| We see lots of students taking advantage and recovering those credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| We launched freshman academy and career themed academies this year in cohort one, and we have started the onboarding process for cohort two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=879)|
| 0:14:48| We have academy coaches in place and they are trained and continuing to be trained in their role as it shifts from opening freshman academy to supporting those career related academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=888)|
| 0:14:59| We have a new position in each of our schools to help with college and career readiness, and we're continuing to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| We have big events coming up in March and April that they will be critical in that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| And then launching elementary and middle school steering committees to understand what career awareness looks like in elementary school, career exploration in middle school, so that students are then ready for that capstone exploration with freshman academy and freshman seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=911)|
| 0:15:26| You'll see two that are yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| One of them is site based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| That one is yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| That is to create site based learning opportunities on school campuses so that students who struggle to get to a site based learning opportunity off campus are able to have that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=930)|
| 0:15:41| We have collected the architectural designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| We've been working with our schools and construction in order for those to start to to go into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| Those have been approved and we're starting the process of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| So you should see that one turn to green pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Now that we've gotten all the approvals in place for that counseling, we are working on a strategic plan for counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| So we have been taking this semester to review where we are, learn what it means to be a counseling model that's connected to career empowerment while making sure that we're implementing all three domains of counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=962)|
| 0:16:15| And we are engaging with an external partner who we have selected who will be helping us to craft our strategic plan around counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=975)|
| 0:16:24| So that's something that should turn green very quickly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| And that's really just a matter of shifting our counseling model to make sure that it is up to date and that everybody, all the stakeholders know and understand how to support counseling, high quality counseling in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=987)|
| 0:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| And we cannot do all this work without great educators in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| Madam Chair, members of the board, you'll see that we are also mostly green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| We'll talk about the yellow last are permanent substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| We currently have seventy nine permanent substitutes in our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| I believe when we spoke to you in October, that was eighty one or eighty two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| So we have had a little bit of turnover, but are continuing to see positive impacts in lessening the disruptions to the learning environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| Our permanent substitutes have filled in for approximately a little over twenty four hundred classified and certified vacancies since they began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1036)|
| 0:17:26| So that's had, again, a positive impact on our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Cognitive coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| We are green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| I believe when we were with you all last in October, we were yellow in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| We are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| We have the first 40, the first cohort signed up to begin in March, and they are a mix of instructional leaders and district personnel, mostly for the first cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1058)|
| 0:17:50| And again, at the end of all three cohorts, we will have two KCS employees that are certified trainers and cognitive coaching that can continue developing our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1070)|
| 0:18:00| Grow your own program expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I'll talk about grow your own and development of math certified educators together because of some opportunities that we've had open up with the Tennessee occupational apprenticeship that has expanded our grow your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1081)|
| 0:18:13| But it's also allowed us to move some funds that had been designated for development of mass certified educators into amendments that that aren't quite approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1093)|
| 0:18:24| But we hope to be able to tell you a little bit more about those when we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| That will expand the reach to more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| So the development of mass certified educators was going to affect approximately 17 employees and that with the proposed amendments will expand to over two hundred and fifty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1110)|
| 0:18:42| So excited about the opportunities to develop teachers, administrators, district personnel, so it'll reach beyond classroom teachers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1122)|
| 0:19:07| Oh, man, that would have been a bummer if my slide wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Madam Chair, members of the board, Dr. Reiswick, just an update on priority for success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Our whole child. So you can see we're mostly green or yellow and interventions and supports for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| To be clear, that doesn't mean we are definitely intervening and providing intervention for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| We're still waiting for some for some programming to be able to extend that menu of options for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| So this is that yellow is more of an and then we're waiting to be able to have access to more programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Our whole child support team, which, again, is where everything sort of starts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| That idea of identifying needs for kids, plugging them into an intervention and then monitoring whether or not it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| Mrs. Cook and her team have done an outstanding job rolling this out to our schools to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| They've had over 2000 students referred for some sort of work within the whole child support team, whether that's around academics, behavior or attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1193)|
| 0:20:04| And the thing that I'm really excited about is that they're actually monitoring whether or not the interventions are working. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| So they have about a 40 percent success rate on the academic side, about a 40 percent success rate on the attendance side and a 59 percent success rate on the behavior side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1208)|
| 0:20:20| Right now, obviously, we would love for that to be 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| But the fact that we're monitoring it so closely to make sure that we can then change those interventions and supports is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| The intervention support tracking system you can see is green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Christine Pope and her team did a great job putting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| We've had that in place since the start of the school year, and that continues to be a great tool for us to leverage, again, to make sure kids are where they need to be as it relates to their interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| The technology investments were really rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| That was really focused on making sure that we had the Promethean boards installed and then also Freddy Cox and his team doing the needs assessment around cybersecurity, which has also been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1250)|
| 0:21:01| So that's like that's green, green facility investment is all about are getting the Lincoln Park property up to up to ADA regulations and expanding some of the classroom space there again to start that newcomer academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1261)|
| 0:21:15| Everything is on track with that for its fall 24 opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| So this board, I think, within this within this year approved the schematic design of the Newcomer Academy and those upgrades to Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| So everything under priority for is is is on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| So as we continue to track and monitor our strategies, we're also tracking our spin down, which again will be completed by September 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1295)|
| 0:21:46| And our CFO, Mr. McPherson, will come and talk us through where we are in terms of the spin down by priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1306)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| So, yeah, so I'm going to be really brief here, obviously, for, you know, it's very sensitive time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| We need to still get to the to the regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| I will just say that, as Miss Kelly had mentioned in the first slide, the total answer amount was one hundred fourteen point one total amount allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1329)|
| 0:22:20| Just keep in mind that almost eleven million dollars of that mostly relates to indirect costs and grant administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| So the final spend or the deadline for spending is September 2024, 20 months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| I just want to caution that as we go through this, the first three priorities that you're going to see, it's going to look a little low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| Right. So it's going to say it's going to be around 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| So don't panic because some of these are a lot of these priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| We're kind of getting off the ground this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| This is the first academic year that we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So this is through December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| We're looking at about five months of spending and in some cases, not even five months of spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| Right. So, you know, when we were hiring tutors, it was a it's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| We're still in the in the in the process of hiring tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| So, you know, we closely monitor this as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Our federal programs department monitors spending literally on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Right. So if it gets to that point later on, we need to get some months under our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| But if it gets to the point later on where we need to revise, we need to kind of shift our thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| We'll do that. And obviously we'll bring those ideas to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| So I'm not going to belabor all of these lines here because you've actually already heard the presentations for much, you know, for the components in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| Just want to talk about each priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| So we're looking at one hundred two million dollars of spending available for our core priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| And so for priority one excellence and foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| So you'll see the heading there. That's really kind of the old term when we applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| So we'll we'll update that. But it's excellence and foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| The bulk of this would be tutors, literacy and math tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Also a large part of this are benchmark assessments with our Mastery Connect platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Also some professional development in our partnership with NIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| One of the another thing I'll point out, we wanted to show it in this format and not in accounting jargon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| because we wanted to show the board that we're really deliberate in how we track this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| We track it by priority, by objective, by strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| So our priority owners, you know, have their buckets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| And so they can see specifically how their initiatives are tracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| So about 10 percent there and then almost about 10 percent here in priority two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Great educators in every school. So we have our teacher leader supports there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| A lot of this would be like department chair stipends, some PD there, permanent subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| You heard Ms. Hilmegaard talk about some of these. Extended contract days would also be in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Our pipeline where we taught, you know, Ms. Hilmegaard again, she talked about grow your own initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| We have apprentice math teachers in that as well. So almost 10 percent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| For number three, this would be our career empowerment and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| This is primarily our school redesign model. These are where the costs would go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| So academy high school model, this would be our academy coaches, our work with Ford Next Gen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Also included in that would be facility redesign where we do some reconfigurations and building improvements at the school to reconfigure the layout so it would be more conducive to work-based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1509)|
| 0:25:21| And so that's in there, college and career counselors, also tutors, high school tutors for recovery credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| So almost 11 percent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| On the last one, overcoming obstacles to learning or success for every student as we call that now, much of this would just be IT and capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1531)|
| 0:25:41| So you can see a large chunk of this has already been spent, 41 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| And much of that you remember back, gosh, it was last year, or calendar year, the interactive panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| Remember that? That was a large chunk of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Also student devices, our one-to-one initiative, that would be included in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| Facility investments, this would be our work at Lincoln Park for some building improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| Those costs are going to start coming online, so you'll see those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| As we go through the months, get some months under our belt, those costs will be eaten up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| But this is for the Newcomer Academy, the work that we're doing at Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| And also our mental health supports, like our contract with Helen Ross McNabb, that would be in this priority two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| So 41 percent here, largely that's a result of the interactive panels that we purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| So I'll summarize on this last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| So you'll see that top row, priorities one through four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| This is the one we're really focusing on, almost 20 percent of spending so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| That column right below that, all other, again, that's our indirect costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| So we just went ahead and counted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| So in total, about 28 percent of spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| But again, we wanted to show you this format to show you that we're really keeping a close eye on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Again, we'll closely monitor this along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| If we feel like that we're really lagging behind in some spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| or we don't think we can fulfill our commitment in some of these areas that we initially wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| obviously we'll take a look at some different strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| We're already thinking about things like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So we would bring that back to the board if and when the time arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| I just didn't want the board to kind of panic when they saw that 10 percent in some of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| So anyway, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| And the next time that we'll be back together will be July 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| And we will capture all of this information and share it in a newsletter this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| For those that didn't have the privilege to be with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| As always, again, we're grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| And while I am the project manager for ESSER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the leadership and the efforts and the hard work of all of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you, Ms. Kelly and everyone who contributed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1681)|
| 0:28:10| All right. So moving into discussion of our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1690)|

| 0:30:36| Would you like to speak to any on S and the process of that meeting or the discussion during that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1836)|
| 0:30:48| Are you asking me to do that now or on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Well, I would do it now because really the purpose of the work session is to have a discussion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Is Sonny here by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Let's have Sonny speak to the process that they went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1861)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, if you can just summarize for the board what you shared with us with the naming facilities committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| So based on policies that we have for naming facilities, we took the zone that was zoned in November for the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1879)|
| 0:31:29| We created a survey and sent it out to all of the members in that zone and got feedback on the school name, got feedback on the mascot and colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1889)|
| 0:31:41| From there, we created a committee that was administration from the three schools impacted, which were Ball Camp, Carnes and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1901)|
| 0:31:51| We pulled in some teachers and some other members from the schools and each PTO or PTA member or president from each of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1911)|
| 0:32:02| We went through all the survey data and came out with Mill Creek Elementary as an otter, as a mascot, and Blue and Silver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, Ms. Schaffnegger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| I thought it was kind of interesting how you all got to the name and kind of the meaning behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Can you share that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| So the school is on Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| The committee, including myself, did not love the name Coward in an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| But we still wanted to capture the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| And Coward is the family that was there in the 1800s, and they built a mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| That mill is on Beaver Creek, which runs up adjacent to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| We couldn't call it Beaver Creek Elementary because naturally you would have to have a beaver as a mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| And as we all know, Carnes has got the beavers and policy says we can't duplicate a mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| So we landed on the otters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Yeah, otters and beavers going at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| They're cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| I will say that the Naming Facilities Committee really appreciated all the work that you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| And we're recommending to the board unanimously to approve the name and the colors and the mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| So thank you for the way you engage the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| And also, too, I really appreciated that you shared that that actual name did show up as that name in the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| So it was some that the community actually picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Yeah, it showed up several times in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And finally, we have 9G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| Mr. Duport, did you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Did you have anything to say about about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| I would like to give you credit for it, because as we know, this was your idea to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Well, I mean, I think we can say more about it when when when we get more details about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| But the board does expect a settlement to happen in the in the jewel case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2063)|
| 0:34:32| And, you know, I can't talk about exactly what share the board would would receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| But, I mean, it's expected that the that the board will receive a share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| So this is this is put into place here so that the board can vote on it and allow Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| Rizewick to to accept those settlement funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And then and then we'll certainly share the exact amounts as they as they come available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| So that concludes our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Miss Henderson, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Yes, we have one public forum speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Welcome, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| You have three minutes to state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Keith Britt, 506 Nolte Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I am the only child of a single mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And I can remember distinctly when I was in elementary school, watching my mother sit at the dining room table with her head in her hands, crying because she couldn't provide for me the things she thought I deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2122)|
| 0:35:37| So I know I know what you're about to put some parents and students through with this student meal debt collection service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2137)|
| 0:35:49| And I've read through the contract and you're going to be getting less than seventy nine cents on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| And I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Seventy nine cents on the dollar is worth the stress that you're going to be putting on these parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| I'm not sure that seventy nine cents on the dollar is going to help student achievement go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| I'm not sure that seventy nine cents on the dollar is going to set the example for our students for what we hope they become when they become leaders of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2172)|
| 0:36:25| I'm not going to sugarcoat it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I'm rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| I make one hundred twenty thousand dollars a year and I get to work from home, which means I pay a boatload of property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| And as the parent of four year old triplets, I can tell you I'm a substantial sales tax contributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| And I know where I want my tax dollars going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| I want my tax dollars going to making sure teachers get a respectable wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| I want my tax dollars going to providing new schools and books, sporting equipment, musical instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2212)|
| 0:37:01| And I want my tax dollars making sure that our kids get at least one good meal a day so that they're not distracted in school from what the teacher is trying to tell them or from what they're trying to read or what they're required to how they're required to perform on a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2221)|
| 0:37:21| We just saw hundreds of millions of dollars of funding that you're trying to figure out how to spend in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| And I can I don't know how big the student meal debt balances are, but I'm pretty sure that point one percent of that would wipe everything off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2248)|
| 0:37:40| And is that point one percent really worth what these families are going to face when we're contracting somebody to call them 20 times a month for three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2260)|
| 0:37:56| I don't know how this vote will play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| It's item eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| See on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| But at a minimum, please pull this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| Please have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| I think we as parents and students deserve to know who is pushing this forward and who is considering students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2286)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| And Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2302)|

| 0:38:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I know many of us were I was involved all along the process with the development of the six five academy strategies and was really thrilled this past week to be able to be a part of that and to be a part of the launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2324)|
| 0:38:55| And I don't know that was planned that way, but also loved coming out of that two days later with the 70 by twenty twenty four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| I thought that was a good pairing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| So a lot of energy in that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Very hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| But actually like that there was that many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| And it was the administrators and the teachers and the kids that were present were really excited about the potential and the opportunities and really kind of owning those academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2349)|
| 0:39:20| So appreciate you, Dr. Wisewick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| And I know there's been people all over the district and Carly and her team really helping communicate the message and make the great branding and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| But I mean, to me, this is a it's a monumental shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I don't think it's anything small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I know what we're proposing with a six five academies and what it's going to be is nothing like what I experienced in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| And I'm glad that we're evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| You know, I think the word process improvement has been mentioned about 20 times during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| And so I appreciate that and the energy and look forward to seeing kids get experienced opportunities that maybe they would have never been never had the opportunity to experience in prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2393)|
| 0:40:05| So, you know, it's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230206?start=2406)|
