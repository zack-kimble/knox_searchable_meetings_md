| 0:00:00| Thank you. I'll call this meeting to order. This is the Tuesday, June 9th, 2015 meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| of the Knoxville City Council. And we will begin with the invocation being given by Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=8)|
| 0:00:15| Della Vopi and the Pledge of Allegiance led by Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=15)|
| 0:00:21| Heavenly Father, thank you for another wonderful day in East Tennessee and the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=21)|
| 0:00:29| to be here to discuss the business of our city and to hear the voices of our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| as we try to act on their behalf. We appreciate the opportunity to do these things and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=35)|
| 0:00:43| hope we have the sense and the humility to hear what our citizens have to say and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| act reasonably. And of course, we are always mindful of those less fortunate than ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=64)|

| 0:01:27| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| Is there a motion to approve the minutes? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| Motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Any opposed? The minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Items for postponement? Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| The consent items are 11J, which is a certificate of compliance, and 12G through U, which are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=105)|
| 0:01:53| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| Any opposed? The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| For the Mayor's report, first a reminder that tomorrow is our annual business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| This will be from 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| As you all know, this is a chance for local businesses to learn about city projects and purchases coming up in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| We have about $55 million in anticipated contracts, so there's a lot of opportunity for local contractors and vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| Thanks again to Boyce Evans, who I think is sitting out there in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| our purchasing agent for organizing this event every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| This is the seventh one, and I understand we have more people pre-registered than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| Is that correct? I see him nodding his head, so that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| But you don't have to be pre-registered to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| You can just come to the Coliseum tomorrow. Again, that's from 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. at our Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| Are they in the ballroom? Is that where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| No, it's in the actual Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| So this Saturday, June 13th, we have another event at the Coliseum, but this one is in the ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| From noon, 12 noon until 3 o'clock, we are hosting the first ever Sons Summit, S-O-N-S,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| a gathering of boys and young men of color between the ages of 12 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| This is a continuation of the work that we started last year with the Save Our Sons Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| I know a lot of council members attended the meeting we had in November to talk about resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| and approaches to reduce violence-related deaths among our young men and boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| The meeting this Saturday is a bit different because this is a chance for the boys and young men themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| to come together and to talk about challenges and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| So if you know boys and young men of color who might be interested in sharing their perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| please make them aware of Saturday's summit and encourage them to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| They can register by contacting Jackie Clay in my office, which you can call 215-2040 into the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=232)|
| 0:04:01| or directly her number is 215-2831.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| This is an important step because all of us need to hear directly from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| and it's great for elected leaders and civic leaders to talk about these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| but it's also important for us to really listen to the people who are most directly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| So I'm looking forward to that, and again, that's this Saturday from noon to 3 p.m. at the Civic Ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| Last thing, there's an event coming up on Sunday, June 21st, which is the first day of summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| to celebrate an important part of Knoxville's literary history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Many of you are probably familiar with James Agee's essay, Knoxville, Summer of 1915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| It served as the prologue to A Death in the Family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| and it is probably the most famous piece ever written about our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| So since we're now entering the summer of 2015, we thought it would be nice to acknowledge the centennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| So the city and Knox County Library are sponsoring a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m. on the 21st of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| at James Agee Park in Fort Sanders, which is, of course, a very fitting location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| And keeping with the spirit of 1915, there will be an ice cream social,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| free ice cream and toppings, along with music of the era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| Local historian and author Jack Neely will talk about life in Knoxville in 1915,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| and then there will be a reading of the essay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| So this is free and open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| People are encouraged to bring blankets or lawn chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| And, again, that's Saturday, June 21st, 5 to 7 p.m. at James Agee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| which is the corner of Laurel Avenue and James Agee Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| And that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Is there a light? I don't see a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| I'm going to call on – this is going to be strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| But I'm going to call on Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Nick, give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| It was a very important meeting that you and Dan Brown and I attended at TDOT this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| on some efforts that a number of people were working on for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| that could be made at the interchange at East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| And I thought it was really – you put it together, and you should speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| Tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| I think, actually, Eddie Smith helped pull this one together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| But we have been talking for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| And, of course, you all know that the first prong of three prongs we're trying to do out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| is to get the logo signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| That's going in place this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| They are seeking a state contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| It is a chance to have 70,000 cars a day possibly exit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| and do whatever they need to do to make their trip more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| and to help the businesses in that locale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Eddie Smith, who is on the Transportation Committee of the State House of Representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| set up a meeting with TDOT because TDOT has been working on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| in fact, we've actually acted on something two weeks ago –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| working on some improvements out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| They are mostly safety-related, but they are going to widen the exit ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| if you're coming from the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| They call it east, but if you're coming from the south going north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| getting off at Exit 8, traffic queues up on that interstate ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| and it would be really bad if you're parked, so to speak, waiting for the light to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and someone behind you is going 60 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| So they're going to try to increase the capacity to get people off the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| and take them down Millertown Pike to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| so that they'll restripe that road and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| The city has worked on that a year ago, a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| They will get cars turning right and not building up the queue and going ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| So they should help that piece a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| They're also going to do some work down on the Washington Pike side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| The good news was they seemed enthusiastic about trying to make some of the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| We talked about some of the clearing that's going to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| and we're hopeful that Dave Brace and his crew will get a little time out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| Cindy Pionke was there for the county as well as Jim Hagerman and several of his folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| Jeff Brannan was there along with the state folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| We talked about some potential clearing to open up some windows to see some of the businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| and that's going to take some kind of a collaborative effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| including the private businessmen that have land that backs up to those hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| And the third thing, that long-range thing we talked about, that is going to take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Some of us were at the meeting that the mayor had with Mr. Fox, the secretary of transportation for the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| and there was some moaning about money and whether there was going to need to be a gas tax increase or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| just because that trust fund is kind of very narrow and very tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| and the gas taxes apparently are, what, levied on a per-mile basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| and as cars get more efficient, excuse me, per-gallon basis, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| as cars get more efficient and get more miles to the gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| they're actually collecting less dollars than they need to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| But in the process, we talked about the fact that the East Town area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| and that's the whole group of businesses in that business district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| they bring in $1.8 million to the city in property tax and $1.7 million, I believe, or $1.6 million to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| But we were trying to get earlier some sales tax information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| and Eddie was able to deal with the finance department in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| and he was able to spring loose something we couldn't get locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| But they projected that last year that area brought in $32.4 million in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| So it's important to both the economies of the state and locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| I think $8.2 million of that was a local share of the tax for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| So it's an area that's got maybe 2,000 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| It's certainly in the peak periods of Christmastime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| It's got a lot of loyalty from people who would rather shop locally there than travel to West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| as wonderful as West Knoxville may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| There's some allegiance to their own shopping area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| and it serves both Jefferson County to the east and, of course, people going all the way up to Kentucky to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| So anyway, the meeting was helpful because it had several different groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| city, county, TDOT, looking at this together and trying to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| and we've got to find a way to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| And the goal, of course, the overall goal is to get rid of the infrastructure obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| and then let business do what they do best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| We're not going to run any businesses, but if we can get the obstacles out of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| and the opportunities there, I think we'll all win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| It'll be a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| So thanks for asking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| And thanks for attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| 9A is an ordinance to approve and adopt the Fiscal Year 2016-2021 Knoxville Capital Improvement Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| including Fiscal Year 2016 Capital Improvement Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Councilman Delavalle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Yeah, I guess I regret that we haven't had a lot of time to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Obviously there's a lot of wonderful programs, and we've talked about a number of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| as we went on during the budget hearings and elsewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| The one I think I would like to raise at this point is the need for new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| There are several different kinds of sidewalks projects in this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| that has both the proposed budget for the upcoming year and the program for the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| and it has $750,000 for new sidewalks in each of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| That bills less than a mile of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| And I don't know about the rest of you, but I assume your experience is the same as mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| Lots of people call from their neighborhoods, from their districts, asking for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| I'll give you an example of what is sort of a tough case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| We have some folks in the Fountain City area that have been trying to get a sidewalk coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Shannondale Road is where their elementary school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| I met with Tom Clabo out there five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| and he said we were 11th on the list and they had about four criteria to assess the different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| Well, five years later, we're number 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| and if we're building less than a mile a year, we're never going to build that at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| So I would suggest that we find a way to reallocate $1 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| for each of those five years coming up in the future and put it in the sidewalk section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| One suggestion, and I'm sure Duane will rip my ears off if I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| but I notice we're putting $3 million a year in Lakeshore for several years in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| and I kind of wonder if that process couldn't go just a tad slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| It was important that we tear down those buildings and get rid of the asbestos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| and upgrade the administrative building, but we've got about $15 million earmarked for that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| and maybe we could share a little of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| or some other dollar that the administration thinks is more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| But I would like to see us take a look at adding more dollars for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I certainly think it's very important in the parental responsibility zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| where kids have to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| I would add that that one line item is $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| but also we typically have additional sidewalk projects that are separately funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| including the one that's in your district and Councilman Campin's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| It's right on your line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Whether there are gaps or broken pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Yeah, this is the old Broadway and I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| That's $1.15 million, I believe, that's also in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| So we have about $2 million in new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Anyway, I calculated like $3 million altogether in sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| either new construction or sidewalk maintenance repairs in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| I know there are a million needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| What I'm suggesting is in the five-future-year plan that we up the ante a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| and I don't know what the right number is, but I'd like to see us do a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| I think we shouldn't mess with this coming year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| but I think on the program portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| I'd like to see us allocate a few more dollars to new sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| just to be able to scratch a very important itch of people getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| and moving about in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Yeah, we absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Sidewalks are great and it's always a matter of weighing all the different projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| but we will continue to look at what projects there are that we can advance each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| and put additional dollars in as available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Anyway, that's my thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Okay, any other discussion on this capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| and Construction Services, Inc. in an amount not to exceed $563,395.75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| for the 2015 sidewalk replacement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Here's a sidewalk project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| We're going to have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| I think the next five or so votes are on sidewalks, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Mayor, could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| If I could ask Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| It really affects the second one, but as I crudely figure this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| it's about $10 a square foot to do these sidewalk replacements in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| There's $563,000 and some change and 57,000 square feet of sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| In the next one, there's 5,340 square feet, and it's about $32 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| Is there some expected price per square foot that you build sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| or replacement sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| I mean, how do you explain the disparity, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| is maybe the better way to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| What do you mean by the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Oh, the next one is there's a big difference between new sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| and replacement sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| If all the infrastructure is in, we just have to pull out the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Break up the concrete and re-pour it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Yeah, you set some forms, pour some concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| It's a whole lot cheaper than starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| So on the second one, you actually have to do even some property acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| The property acquisition has already been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| But it's the surveying and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| It's surveying, grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| I believe there's a fence in the way in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| More prep work, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Yeah, all the drainage infrastructure that has to go in, curbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| There's a whole lot more to putting in new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Okay, that explains the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=991)|

| 0:18:50| You can talk if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| We'll do it like the beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| This is for Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| AT&T has been involved in several road projects in the 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| and in each case, the projects have dragged on for a very long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| because AT&T did not have this a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| What assurances do we have that they will get their work done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| so that we can proceed with these streetscapes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I guess we have – I'm not sure how strong the assurance that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| is the fact that we're getting this done well in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| and actual construction helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Sometimes they just take a long time to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| There's always the possibility that they'll drag us down again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| but we're planning on construction the first part of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| But we don't have anything in place to encourage them financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| to get their act together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| Much leverage on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1202)|

| 0:20:05| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Well, I was just thinking maybe you get some insulated bolt cutters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| give them a deadline, and if they're not done, just chop them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I guess my question was, we're talking about two different –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| this one and the next one has two different utility relocation projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| for the same 2,400 feet down West Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| How come AT&T is so much more expensive than KUB to move utility connections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Well, consider the location of the AT&T main computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| That big concrete building you see on the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| This is a main line for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| There's a whole bunch of data going through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| I don't know the technical details of exactly what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| but it's a complicated process to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| They have to have a backup system in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| It is a main trunk line for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Well, it sounds like your leverage is to get a backhoe poised over that main trunk line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| and you'll get them moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1266)|

| 0:23:00| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Peter Ahrens, City and Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| The fees prior to this didn't have a breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| It was at the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| It was at the high end there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| So what our goal is is to try and allow smaller projects to go through this process at a lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1392)|
| 0:23:22| So it's not comparable to anything else in the zoning district because these form codes are not comparable to anything in the form district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| Are they higher than other districts or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| These are the only districts that have fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| The other zoning districts do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1416)|

| 0:23:50| We already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Do you want to re-vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Oh, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| We've already voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Did you hear it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| 12A is an ordinance to amend the capital budget and operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Both is approved by Ordinance O95-2014 for the fiscal year 14-15 and to transfer surplus, excess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1439)|

| 0:24:11| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Councilman, did you stare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| 12B is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 14-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Councilman Daliboke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I don't want to go off on one of my crazies again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Jim York is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Without walking all the way down, maybe you could stand and nod your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| We're spending $2.4 million for this building and, of course, we had the Urban Land League's recommendations and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1483)|
| 0:24:53| Is there a recovery period after that where we'll get that much back out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| In other words, is there a cost benefit that justifies the expenditure or what do you think the net will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| That's really a question for Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| At this point, it's impossible to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| We'll go through an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Did you have independent appraisals of what it's worth now as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Yes, we have and we've been talking with the state about updating those appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| And you're going to then rehab it enough to stabilize the building so it doesn't deteriorate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| DBA is in charge right now of actually maintaining that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Once an RFP process has been initiated and a selection has been made, then we'll understand further what the plans are going to be for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1534)|
| 0:25:44| But at this point in time, it's impossible to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| So before the RFP, you're not doing like roof work or stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Well, the long-term plan, we don't even know if we'll have the building, but what we'll do right now is stabilize the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| continue to maintain the exterior grounds area to make it nice and neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| And until we get to this process, it's probably not going to put additional funds into that existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| And do you know what the turnaround time frame is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| I know you're looking at a maximum of 2018, I think you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Yeah, I'll let Bill answer that or Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| It's just, as Chris is saying, you just can't tell right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| We know we need to move forward on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| It's a property in the heart of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| We've had several redevelopment proposals in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| We're going to try to be more focused on what we ask for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| We would hope that the RFP would go out sometime next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Once we acquire it, we do think we can get some money out of parking on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So we do think there will be a return right there at that time, right across the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And by more focused, you're going to try to get the type of building use that you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| That's clearly what the ULI recommendation said and we would agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Those who went through the process the last time would say we need to put a little more focus on the front end on what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| so we don't have some incompeting different interests on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Not just dollars, but end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| End result for the development of downtown, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| I guess I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Just an update on the 625 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| You said sanitary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Yeah, the sanitary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Are we planning to sell that and what's basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| That's when we got to a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| So it's a whole different procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| They hadn't paid their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| The short answer to that is yes, but it's a complicated project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| It has environmental liens against the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| It has federal tax liens against the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| It has significant, we understand them, but there are some significant environmental issues still on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| So it is our goal to dispose of that property, but how we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| we need to be very careful to make sure that we don't take any unnecessary risk for the city at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| And it needs a new roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| I mean, there's a lot of issues with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| We're hopefully going to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| We have ambitious developers out there, we hope, that want to take this one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| So sometime this summer is the chance we'll put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I mean, is the money in this item going to cover the issues you brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| The one that you moved, the money that's being moved into downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| that we would hope would help us stabilize some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| There's some marble that's moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| We'd hope that would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| When we got into this, we hoped it would help us do the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| We're not sure the $200,000 will do the roof on that building at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| So one more, I guess, so you hope to possibly get it into public hands next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Well, I hope to get it back out of the public hands and into private hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Private hands, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Over the latter part of this year would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 17, Article VI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Division I, Section 17-287 to improve the regulation of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| by allowing certain parking upon the paved shoulder of roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Yeah, I just wondered, maybe Jim can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| if this was because of any particular certain issue or area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| I've had some, you know, interest of illegal parking up in the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and just wonder if there's something that's brought this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| or if you were just trying to clean it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Mostly we're just trying to clean it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| There are a few places around town where there is just where the parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| is delineated by just a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| It's a legitimate parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Glenwood Street, East Glenwood is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| There's no reason not to park there, but according to the ordinance, it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| So this is mostly cleanup, but it does give us some more operational flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| We can mark off places like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| and we don't have to put stalls to define exactly where you can park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| which adds a whole bunch of labor to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| You run down, I mean, you make the long line with the truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| you do the cross lines with the hand-operated equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| So there's a lot of situations where you really don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| where there's demand for parking, there's a legitimate space for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| but you don't have to pack them in so you don't have to define the stalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| It gives us some more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| It makes me think of the area along Broadway in front of Fountain City Lions Club building at the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| I know a couple years ago it was brought up they may do away with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| which made some people upset, so I think this makes that legit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| I noticed that in some places signs would be installed so that people would know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| So we're moving away from signs, but now we're talking about installing some more signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| I suspect that in most places where there is a striped-off shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| and we don't want them to park, there's already signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| But, again, that gives us a little more flexibility to just make it really clear where we can park and where we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| I mean, if you have a four-lane road, high-volume road like Needland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1877)|
| 0:31:28| it's really not a good idea to park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| It's a moving shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| There's already signs out there that say not to park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Councilman Grave, did you turn yours off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| It's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| It's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Just a quick follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| We're flipping it from don't park in that area if there's a solid line to you can park unless we affirmatively either put a sign or mark the curb yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1903)|
| 0:31:55| We're going to rattle the saber saying don't park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| That'll be the notice approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| And I think it's really much clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I mean, I doubt that very many people in the city are aware that it's illegal to park anywhere there's a solid white line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| So, it's just really a lot clearer to make that affirmative message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Give them the affirmative notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Are there other parts of the city where people are parking maybe in front of their house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| It's mostly the older parts of town where this situation exists, and this just makes it clear that it is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Unless there's a sign otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=1967)|

| 0:33:20| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| We've got actually four people signed up to speak, and typically we only allow three on a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| So did you all discuss this among yourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| You're doing the first three, or who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| This is who I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Liam Hischelin, Fiona McNally, Robert Hodge, and then Brenna Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| So the first three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| So Fiona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| So Council, first I'd like to ask Erin actually to come up and to give us a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Well, thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Council, for considering this ordinance change tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| We're very excited to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| I know several of you were with us this morning at Beardsley Farm celebrating a terrific event, expanding a community garden here in the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2046)|
| 0:34:16| What we really seek to do tonight is expand on the momentum that's represented by groups like Beardsley, the Center for Urban Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| and so many of the smaller community efforts that folks have in their own backyards, growing food for themselves and their family with their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| as well as with their neighbors in a more community garden-like setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| So the growing interest in urban agriculture speaks to the desire of many of our residents to highlight and support the region's agricultural heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2075)|
| 0:34:45| as well as promote healthy eating and local food, which have been identified through many public processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| including the Food Policy Council and Plain East Tennessee, as well as the Bloomberg Challenge Grant that we put in for several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| as priorities for many of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| We are trying to respond to that interest and that desire to promote urban agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| while also respecting some of the very legitimate concerns that we've heard from neighborhood representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| who are wondering how urban agriculture might interact with their neighbors, with the neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| So, as you know, we've been working on this for several months, really close to a year, and have had many conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2116)|
| 0:35:25| You have a handout in front of you tonight that lists how we've been in front of the public on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| So we've been very involved, and also with staff both at the city as well as MPC, the health department, many other of our community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| So what we're looking to do is respond to requests for clarity around what is an allowable use related to urban agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| as well as remove some of the restricted barriers that have prevented people from using their personal property for growing food and gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| At the same time, as I mentioned, we've heard from folks who have legitimate concerns about how urban agricultural practices might interact with neighboring properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| and in response we've added several new performance standards that give our code officials the tools they need for effective enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| including on activities like composting or beekeeping that might be potentially something that neighbors might want to be interested in and concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2168)|
| 0:36:19| So your agenda packet, and I know several of you have looked at that in depth and we appreciate that consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| has the full list of changes we're proposing as well as additional discussion on content and background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| So again, you have the public outreach in front of you, and we think that we've taken input from both supporters and some folks who may be more skeptical very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| and we believe the proposed changes tonight adequately address those concerns while also accommodating and advancing urban agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| and the rights of residents to grow their own food on their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| So I'm very happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Brian Blackman, our sustainability project manager, has done a lot of the hard work and heavy lifting putting these ordinances together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| so I may defer to him on some of those detailed questions, but we certainly want to hear your thoughts tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you, Erin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Should we hear from the speakers first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Okay, so first, Liam Hischelin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| Appreciate you being here, Liam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Council rules, you have up to five minutes, and I'll set the timer and have the duty of letting you know how you're doing on the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Okay, I won't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Liam Hischelin, and I'm at 220 West Jackson Avenue, apartment 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| I'm speaking on behalf of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| and we want to give our full support for the recommendation to enhance urban food systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| We have worked as a food policy council on this issue and had public meetings over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| We really seek kind of input of folks throughout the community, and this has been one of the top issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| the ability to grow food, kind of understand what can be used when it relates to sheds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| or water access on their own land and publicly vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| We also think that the recommendations put forward really help clarify a lot of the issues that we've heard from people in these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| and we really see for the last couple of years the changes that have happened in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| and the property that are put forward here and have really kind of worked at consulting with other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| to kind of have everything aligned that really makes sense for a positive change when it relates to urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| We think these recommendations will enable our citizens to better access healthy food at their home, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| and business agriculture activities, which we think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| We also have noticed issues of food deserts, and we think this will help with citizens both grow their own food for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| and also for business entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| So, again, to keep it brief, we urge you to support the recommendations laid out, and we thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| Thank you, Liam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Next is Robert Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you for being here, Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| My name is Robert Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| I'm at 3303 Delrose Drive, 37914, and work with the Knoxville Botanical Garden and Arboretum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| directing the Center for Urban Agriculture, which is on Boyds Bridge, Pike, or Wimpole in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And I've also been on Food Policy Council for five years and can confirm just so much has been done in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| to hear what people are wanting to do, pull people together, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| And these are the things that we heard over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| We want to do more, but we run into this problem, this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| Could we make some adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| So this has been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Thank you for allowing us to speak on behalf of an increase in the growing of food in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| During the last two and a half years, we have established a Center for Urban Agriculture in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| It's a place where families, neighbors, church groups, groups of kids all come to learn how to grow food for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| and grow food for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| So they're coming and seeing and they're going and doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| There are now established best practices for erosion prevention, for handling compost in a way that is quick and easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| and isn't smelly, for cover cropping, which is a way of covering over your soil in the different seasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| so that you don't have erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| When you have a heavy rain, the crops are covered and the soil is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Weed maintenance can be made a lot easier through use of wood chips and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| And again, we're showing how to do this and take what is otherwise waste and going to landfills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| going to other places and utilizing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| And rainwater catchment is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| So there are best practices in place when it comes to training people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| We say, what's going to happen if this goes out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| And people just start doing their own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| We've got ways of training and are using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Gardens in the city lower crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Gardens add beauty to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| Gardening on a lot in your neighborhood gets the neighbors out and get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| It brings people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| And it changes people's lives and their health and their perspective on the places around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| Making urban agriculture easier will make our communities stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| and more able to withstand whatever lies ahead in heavier, more difficult times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| whether they're natural disasters, whether there's a terror attack on infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| that the government keeps warning about, or some other calamity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| Our ability to be able to feed ourselves really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| It's important right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| You can easily imagine a time when that is paramount, and we need to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| Here in my hand is a history of East Knoxville that my son and I picked up last Friday when we were at Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| And something that caught my attention is this right here where it says farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| This is an establishment, justice and company on 500 East Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| And it's all these things for you've got a small gardening, big gardening, small farm operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| This is East Knoxville, 1924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| So farming is not new for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| And to talk to the old timers, they remember a time when we cared for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And this is in a place called The Bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Some of you know where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Austin Homes is right in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| And so I'm seeing, we're seeing hands-on the transformation in some of our marginalized communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| when we're allowed to do these very things, to begin to garden together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| And so I encourage you to vote in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Nothing is changing this part of Knoxville more today than urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| And these adjustments that are before you set us on a new path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Thank you, Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| And now Brenna Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Brenna Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| My name is Brenna Wright, and I am farm manager at Abbey Fields Urban Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| That was started in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Your home address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Oh, I'm sorry, Brenna Wright, 3616 Estuary Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| And so I had gone to school for agriculture and conservation and that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| and lived in the Old North neighborhood at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and was working on a rural farm and was super excited to work on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| There was a splatted green space right across the tracks from where we lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| and I thought it would be really, really cool to start a farm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| So I went back to school for things such as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| and then fell into this whole awesome community of people who are pushing for urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| So I want to appeal from the for-profit aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| We're development-supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| It's privately owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| It's right beside the standard knitting mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| It's a two-and-a-half-acre lot that was previously just brambles and tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| and we're revamping that to be kind of a community space and also a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| We're supported by the community, so we're not quite a community garden per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| We're CSA-supported, which is community-supported agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| So we have 50 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| We grow enough food for, on an acre and a half, we grow enough food for 50 families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Like I said, this is our second season working with urban soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| and it's just been amazing to have this support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Like I said, we wouldn't be able to exist if people weren't investing financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| and idealistically into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| So we keep bees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| We compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| So all these things are very important to us to kind of see how we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| if we wanted to develop other lots in the city, other blighted lots in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| how are we going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Like where's our guidebook to say, like, this is what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| We can pull water from where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| You know, those sorts of things are really important for my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| and then also other businesses because there's so much blighted space in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| So I kind of want to appeal to you on behalf of the blight in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| That's something that all community members and neighborhood can say, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| hey, let's do something neat with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| And so, like I said, and also the small business aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| So I'm thrilled that I get paid to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And so I know that there's hundreds and hundreds of other people who would like to do this for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| but we're kind of just trying to figure out what that actually looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| And also several other developers that are kind of interested, like, how is this going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| And, you know, is this going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| I get all the time as a city in support of, and I always say yes because everyone's been super great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| But, yeah, so I just encourage you to, I thank you and encourage you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Okay, that's the end of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Yes, I guess I'll ask this of Ms. Gill because sometimes we think everyone knows these particular phrases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| but could you give us a little definition of a food desert and what that really means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| And Brian will be able to quote the USDA definition better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| But the idea is that it is a statistical evaluation of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| to determine the accessibility of fresh produce through a grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| or other establishment that serves a variety of fresh foods versus sort of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| if you think of the convenience store model where it may not be fresh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| it might be frozen or otherwise packaged with preservatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| So food desert, Brian, you want to come up and tell us a little bit more about the statistical definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| and where they exist in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Brian Blackman, project manager, Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| I think Erin hit it right on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| There's a lot of factors that go into food deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| That can be sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| That can be road access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| But primarily it's your ability for your community to access fresh food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| in what we would consider a socially acceptable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Food pantries, emergency food outlets are not considered by the USDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| a socially acceptable way to access food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| It needs to be a way for a family to go and purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| There are a variety from limited access to more impeded access by the USDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| and that can be a half mile to a mile of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| We have 20 food deserts in the city here, and they're in surprising neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Neighborhoods that you may think of as being close to a grocery store or a Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| but the access, the sidewalk limitations are a heavy factor in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| I attended a meeting at Councilor Y last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| and one question that was brought up, and I'm going to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| because I think it's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| I think more than one person asked about, as far as backyard gardens, the kind of disordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| what kind of restrictions would that place on people that want to do something in their own yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| And let me speak a little bit to sort of how we got to where we are from that public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| So for those of you who attended that public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| you'll remember that what we were introducing for community gardens was a new registration process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| and the reason for that was so that we could keep track and manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| But at the same time, it raised a lot of questions for folks who were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| well, what if I'm gardening in the lot next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Well, it's not the lot that I live on, but do I have to register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I'm gardening in my own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Why do I have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| So what we've done in this new ordinance, or I shouldn't say new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| but the proposed changes evolving from the public meeting is to not look at that registration process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| really to define three primary types of gardens, the first one being a personal garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| and that's you or your family or a guest growing on a lot that you own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| be that the one that you live on or the one next door or elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| If you're gardening on your private property, you're allowed to do that by right in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| The concepts in this, I think, are very healthy for our city, but I have a couple of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| The first one is the nine-month produce stands that appear to be part of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| that somebody on any street can set up a produce stand to sell their vegetables or fruits, whatever they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| I'm not real sure this is something that the city needs to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| Those stands may look great during the growing season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| but I'm not as confident that once the growing season is over, people will disassemble those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| and so that very much disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| The second thing is the beekeeping component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| Many people, and I know that the mayor is a beekeeper, so just close your ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| Closing around your hive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| But the mayor also doesn't live on a postage stamp lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Correct, but I have lots of neighbors, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| But I'm thinking of some very small lots where the houses are very close together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| and that my child is allergic to bees, very allergic to bees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| and so the bees leave the hive and my child is out playing in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3032)|
| 0:50:40| How do we address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Yeah, those are great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| I'm going to let Brian speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| but I'll say first that they were two points that were brought up in the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| that we've been able to dive very much into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| and hopefully have addressed to address your concern, which are very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| So the seasonal sale of farm produce is already allowable by permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| It's a four-month permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| You can get a temporary permit for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| We're proposing to expand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| but we did hear a lot of concerns about what is allowable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| if somebody is building a shed or some sort of stand out front with an awning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| So what we've done is we've clarified that this needs to be a table or cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| We've specified the type of structure that we want somebody to have in the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| based on those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| To your second point about the bees, due to the Tennessee State Apiary Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| we cannot prohibit bees in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| We can provide zoning provisions for best practices to mitigate any danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| So that's what we've done is look at best practices from other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| and included some setback requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| and making sure that people have their hives not facing their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| but also having a 15-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I've been concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| I like the idea of making sure we have regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| that enable us to use abandoned lots, blighted lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| public lots that can have community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| That's all well and good, and having a system of dealing with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| and dealing with the problems from that is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| I get stumped when I see an attempt to regulate private gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| It seems to me that the government doesn't need to be governing your activity on your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| I know you're trying to introduce best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| trying to avoid the obnoxious use of land by someone that interferes with their neighbor's use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| I'm not so sure that the dirty lot rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| and all those other things wouldn't come into play to actually deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| But it strikes me that at some point Big Brother starts to cross the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| I mean, if I have a flower garden and not a vegetable garden, no one cares what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| If I work on a car in my backyard, apparently no one cares what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| But all of a sudden they come and they investigate your mulch pile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| or your structure on there to run your garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| I just think it's intrusive for a private garden on a private lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| where you live on it and you're doing it for your personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| And I kind of wonder why the government is getting in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| It just seems to me like I feel like someone's going to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| I have to drink a smaller soda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| It's kind of getting into personal liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| So I kind of wonder why we have to have that sort of aspect governed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| by this broader sense of urban agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| which is good and which is a positive for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Well, we appreciate the statement of support for urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I think what we're responding to is simply that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| if your neighbor takes offense to anything that you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| they can call us and it's up to a code official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| who may not be looking at clear guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| to make a determination of how to respond to that nuisance complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| And so what we're doing here is adding clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| so that when they go out to respond to that nuisance complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| if it occurs, and it may not, but if it occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| that they have the tools that they need to make that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| in a fair way to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| And do you see a difference between public group gardening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| and private property use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| We have to define that in terms of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| such that that was a response that we had from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| And what we're looking at now is purely to add clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| to what a community garden is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| such that it does not start turning a residential function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| into a commercial function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Okay, well, again, I just think maybe this doesn't cross it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| but I think this is somewhat of an intrusion to personal liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| and people buy a house and a lot and land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| and think they can do on it whatever they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| as long as it's not illegal or obnoxious, you know, polluting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| whether it were noisy or smelly or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| But it just seems to me that I don't know if it's not the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| down a slippery slope of too much control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| over what our citizens do in their castle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| I mean, their house, their lot is their castle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| and I kind of wonder if we need to be intruding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| But that's my thought process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| just a concern of whether this is something we should be regulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Which, to that point, we're not imposing any new regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| for personal or community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Well, in fact, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| You're having rules on how you contain your compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| I have happened to have had a backyard garden for 42 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| in Holston Hills, never had a pissed-off neighbor yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| on anything I've done, but I stack my leaves on my garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| For example, in the fall when I'm raking and gathering them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| and then in the spring I turn them under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| I use lime to neutralize the acid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I use some of the leaves to tamp down the weeds, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| Without sunlight, weeds don't germinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| But I don't need someone to come there and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| you better put that in a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I put all of my backyard leaves on my garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| let them sit there until the spring when I can turn them under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| And it seems to me that you're setting up a regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| and this is not about my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Come on over and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| I just think that the government doesn't need to be that close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| to what we do on our private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| It is a castle in this country, and I want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| So that was my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3394)|

| 0:57:08| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Okay, we now have public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| and we do have three people signed up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| And they'll be in this order, Suzanne Miller, Alexis Rush, and Paige Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3436)|

| 0:57:26| and we ask that you state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| and I'll set the timer for you and keep you advised of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Hi, my name is Suzanne Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| I live at 4407 Barber Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| I want to thank De La Boca for listening to us many years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| talking about our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| I love the fact that you guys all do appreciate sidewalks and love communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| I can hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Part of being here tonight was just we just had a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| science purchase for our roads to slow people down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| drive like your kids live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Part of the reason we've done that is people love to cruise down our road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| We put them out two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Yesterday, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Maybe three days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Then two nights ago, we heard wonderful crunch here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| then another wonderful crunch there, and then my sign ran over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| So a mailbox was hit at 4403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| One mailbox was hit across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| Another mailbox was hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| The beautiful part was then our drive like our kids live here was ran over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Maybe four years ago, I almost witnessed my neighbor being ran over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| because of the same mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| The first mailbox hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| He was playing football with his son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| All of a sudden, the son went to go after the football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Moments later, that mailbox was hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| It's a common occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| I remember when we first moved here, it was Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| My son was five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| We're on the street on the proper side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Big group, Halloween costumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| It was still light out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| My son almost got hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| There's no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| There's parts of the street that are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Parts of the lines are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| It's not just do we need sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| We need safer roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| The lines are barely seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| We live on the Dogwood Trail, which is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| I would love for my children to walk to Shannondale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| I would love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| I can't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Part of that is there's no safe exit for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| But it's not just kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| There's a community thing that's been a beautiful thing talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| Because we live on the Dogwood Trail, people love to walk it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| But we're scared to walk it because we don't know where to go with drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| I believe my husband, Michael Olsen, contacted you seven years ago about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| You've been very kind to listen to us, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| I don't understand how, again, we were fifth, and now we're 11th or 34th now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| 34th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| 34th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| New projects have come in, and they've had better criteria, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| It's just a strong need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| So I just wanted to just see a face, show that we care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| This is a beautiful community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| We have a small section here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I could fill this room if you'd like, if you need to see more of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| But it's not just the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| It's our elderly folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| It's our regular folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| I think I've replaced my mailbox three different times, just me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| I don't know about my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| But anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Mayor, if I could, I just want to mention to Alexis that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| Oh, I'm Suzanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| I'm sorry, Suzanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Alexis will be speaking in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Suzanne, that Jeff Branum, who is our traffic engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| and Ernie Pierce, who is the traffic controls guy for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| were at the Fountain City Town Hall meeting last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| and I asked them to look into Barber Drive in terms of what they might do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| and to contact some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| and I have sent them one or two of the emails so that they could see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| Your concerns are real, and it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| These are livable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| We want to make them safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| It is hard when you have a narrow road and a ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| where you really can't walk in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| So I can appreciate the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| But hopefully those engineers will get in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| If they don't in the next several days, dial 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| and ask for Jeffrey Branum or Ernie Pierce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| because they vowed a mighty oath that they would contact you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| And also I wanted to thank sending police officers to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| to help slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| They were there today, so I appreciate that when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| I just can't stress this enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| It's important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| It's a real community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Our whole street knows each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| We would love it to be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Alexis Rush, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| Thank you for allowing us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| My name is Alexis Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| My husband is Rush Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| And I'm sorry about the miscommunication there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I'm a resident of 4406 Barbara Drive in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| a mom to two precious children who are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| You've probably heard them babble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I do believe it's important for children to understand where government starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| And I'm a concerned citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Our neighborhood is an almost picture-perfect American neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| much like Suzanne said, where neighbors have weekly get-togethers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| kids play in each other's yards each afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| and homeowners look out for one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| whether it be pet-sitting, helping with home repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| or babysitting like my neighbors are doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| The only part that makes our neighborhood not picture-perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| is the excessive amount of speeding vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| which terrifies parents and threatens the safety of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| who walk from house to house to visit one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| or those who simply walk, bike, or run for exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| There are no sidewalks or shoulders on our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| leaving many neighbors to make cut-through paths between houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| because it is too scary to walk on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| when a car is traveling in excess of 40 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| By the way, I'm pretty sure the speed limit is 30 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| which is scary to experience when you have no place to stand or get out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| especially when you have two small children six months and three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| I cannot take him on a walk in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| As a parent of a preschooler who is just learning to cross the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| this is maddening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| My husband and I have gone to such lengths as to spray-paint an orange line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| in our driveway and in our grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| so that our daughter knows not to cross the line in our driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| and not in our grass or to get anywhere near the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| Cars simply do not slow down, even when, like Suzanne said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| there are three of us who have just put up signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| one of which was run over, that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Drive like your kids live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Again, as Suzanne said, on Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| a speeding driver who appeared drunk damaged multiple yards and mailboxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| where each of us have stood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| We check our mail every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| The driver got away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| To think this person can still come through our neighborhood again is horrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| I hope you all understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| My daughter is three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| She knows her letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| She knows her numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| She has never checked the mail with me because I will not take her to the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3884)|
| 1:04:52| We know vehicles drive too fast, and Sunday was proof of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Similarly, we have had to replace our own mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| We are one of those neighbors because someone has hit it while driving too fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| and this was years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| As a mom, a native Knoxvillian, a taxpaying resident of our wonderful city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| I beg you for help, each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I go to bed every night thanking God that my child was not harmed by a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| while she played in our yard or walked with me to play at a neighbor's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| There has to be a way to solve this problem, whether it is setting up radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| and I'm thankful to hear that that happened today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| constructing speed bumps, changing the speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| or our divine plan would be creating sidewalks and shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| so children, walkers, runners have some place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Right now there is no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| I beg you, please help us solve this issue before someone is injured or loses their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Paige Fowler, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| My name is Paige Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| I live at 4401 Fulton Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| I didn't really have a whole lot of time to prepare a big speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| but I'm going off base of observations of the house I've lived in for six months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| As a parent of two children, I chose the Shenandoah School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| I chose the Fountain City area for many reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| knowingly that I'm also paying almost twice as much property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| as I could have paid much less if I lived further out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| I chose this area for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| It has a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| It has a historical area and a beautiful area of, like you said, it's on the Dogwood Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| The two main factors I see that are the problem in this area are the roads themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| There are roads with no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| There are ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| And when you look upon a road and you see two double yellow lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| to me that already speaks volumes that this is a high-traffic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Fulton and Barber Drive both lead into the Shenandoah area to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| It's less than a half a mile from my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| I cannot let my child walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| He's 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| He should be allowed to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| The school buses don't come and pick up my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| I have to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| They have the right to be able to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| They have nothing to walk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| And the wonderful thing about this community, it is a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| It is a growing community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| We're a growing community with gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| and all the things that you would want to see in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| However, we are lacking the ability to go across the street to visit our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| My children are now climbing over my fence and over my neighbor's fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| just so they can go play safely in our mother friend's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I can't allow them to walk around the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| And if they do, my heart is always racing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| I always have to look over the fence just to make sure they got there safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| This isn't a situation of, like, please be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| This is an area where there is just no place for runners, bikers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| or our children to be able to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| And you have to look at the situation, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| These kids don't even have a bus system to come and get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| They should be allowed to be able to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| And I know that you were saying that there's not enough money in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| and we're down on 34 of not having sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| I don't think sidewalks are just the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I mean, because the fact that these roads are two yellow double lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| high traffic areas, I think we need to look past that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| and look at probably putting speed bumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| forcing people to be more cautious drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| I'm sorry, radars set up for a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| That's not going to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| The problem is that the roads themselves lend themselves to speeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| the way that they're designed with the double yellow lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| And because they are two cut-through roads that go into Shannondale up to Tasmal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| they're cut-throughs, the traffic will always be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| there will always be speed problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| And if you create barriers that make people slow down purposefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| then we might help solve the problem, at least with the high speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| Council, there's no other business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150609?start=4135)|
