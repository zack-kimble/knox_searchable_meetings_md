| 0:00:30| I now call to order this special meeting of the Knox County Commission as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| relates to having a public hearing. Madam Clerk, would you please call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| attendants and call the meeting to order. Commissioner Gill. Present. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=40)|

| 0:00:56| Present. All members are present. Okay, Madam Clerk, we have one item on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| agenda for this public hearing. Would you mind reading that item's caption into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| All right, well, the caption is a discussion of Ordinance O-19-8-102| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| proposing amendments to the Knox County Code Appendix A zoning Article 6 by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| adding a new section, 6.80, to create a planned development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| That is the item before us, and this is a public hearing, so if anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| would like to approach the County Commission to share their advice on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| This was also on the work session agenda as it relates to voting on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| so there has been some discussion on this during the work session, but I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| open the floor for anyone who'd like to share additional feedback on this. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| could please approach the podium, you'll have five minutes. Please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| and address for the record. Thank you. Jennifer Roach, Knoxville Area Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| Realtors, 609 Wise Garber Road. I'm clearly more adept at planning things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| than Ethics Committee information. I'll get the details on that worked out. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| was good to talk to you at the first reading on this, and our recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| as an association is that it goes forward as is. There have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| compromises already made in this as it's gone through the planning in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Board. Only tracts of 10 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| only within the urban growth boundary. We would take the staff recommendations on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| that. We are against requiring all of the, and only all of the six things in 6.80.04C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| would like to keep in that information where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| design characteristics and amenities to be considered in this determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| include but are not limited to the following. That but not limited to is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| actually very important verbiage there because not only does it say, hey you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| might have to do things, you may have to do other things that are not included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| here. So that adds flexibility and provides some other ways to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| developments work for the community. So again we would recommend leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| that as is. Sorry, moving back in the ordinance 6.80.01F would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| encourage to leave encourage here. Encourage land development that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| greatest extent possible preserves natural vegetation and so on. To the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| greatest extent possible is really the informing words there. If you require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| land development that to the greatest extent possible preserves natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| vegetation, I don't know that's a threshold that any development could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| reach. To me that kind of sounds like it would only be natural vegetation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| maybe no development if we required all of it to be preserved. That's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| going a bit into the absurd but encouraging to the greatest extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| possible is really a high bar. The other item that has been proposed by some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=238)|
| 0:04:07| other groups to remove infrastructure improvements as part of, excuse me, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| is 6.80.04C number two, removing improvement of existing on-site and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:22| off-site infrastructure. That's really important to keep that in there. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| not just roads, that's utilities, that's sewer, that's you know anything that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| think of with infrastructure there. I think those are some of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| are of most contention and really important to making certain developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| work from the development side, from the community side, from the government side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| You know this is a process, a plan development process that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| really in favor of. It is, like I think all groups have mentioned, a really great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| tool in the zoning toolbox for Knox County to be able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| It's already gone through a lot of scrutiny and has already made some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| compromises in there, so we recommend it going through as is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| Thank you. Commissioner Smith? No questions. Okay. Commissioner Jay? Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| Chairman. Ms. Roche, I just have a couple quick questions. Does this make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| for developments to get zoning changes? Well, these are not zoning changes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| getting rezoned is something you do, you put a different label on a piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| This is the development on that land. This is plan development. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| process. This is not, it's really apples and oranges when you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| rezoning and you're talking about this plan development process. What's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| about this process is that, like if you take an area of town, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| maybe a major intersection that doesn't have development, you can get all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| under one ownership, which is a requirement in here, and get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| whole plan development planned out. You can vision it together as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| community, as a government, as developers, and really get that all done together. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| that is not a rezoning, that's planning out what's going to go on top of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| And everything in the zone, those properties and its zoning and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| requirements of those zones, like design standards, are all required unless, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| are all required unless you meet these things in here. So, yeah, it's a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| good process, but it is not equivalent to a rezoning. And is that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| development, you talked about the major intersection that needs a bigger vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Sure. Is it fair to say that that is important because, let's say you own six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| or eight or ten properties around one big intersection, but it was one owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| instead of working on, this is going to be commercial office, this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| residential, this is going to be storage unit, this is going to be roads and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| bridges, you know, every piece and part and kind of going through as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| development team, having each one of those processes start and start on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| individual basis, this would allow a much bigger vision so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| could see the process all the way through, instead of having ups and downs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| ups and downs, ups and downs, and maybe one piece didn't get matched, and you sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| have a bigger vision. Is that accurate? Yeah, I think that's a great illustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| of it, is you're able to do it all at once. So, I think the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| gets more of a guarantee that certain things are going to happen, that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| got it all planned out in there, so you don't have just one chunk happen and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| then maybe the rest fizzle out, but it's all, you know, kind of reliant on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| other. It could create efficiencies in infrastructure, you're putting it all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| at once and things like that. Is there an example of this type of ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| that exists in the city or the county that we would, you know, think, oh okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| that makes sense? Very similar to the one that's been put into recode with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| type of higher level scrutiny in the beginning of the process, like before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| gets to Knoxville, Knox County planning, and into the requirements of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| public benefits to it. So, is this like a, like North Shore Town Center, would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| be an example of this, where there's sort of a general, overall overarching plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| the entire retail, shopping, housing, schools, etc., is sort of a bigger concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Is that? Yeah, I think the bigger concept is the way, I think North Shore Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Center is a good example of what could be. And is this, would this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| create a shorter, less expensive process for somebody to, more, you know, less, less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| excruciating or extenuating circumstances, or would it create a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| longer, more detailed, like, what level of community versus development, you know? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| think the process is going to be higher level scrutiny. The process from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| you know, from from word one of, hey, I want to do this, to getting in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| the first public meeting, that's going to be more expensive, that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| more detailed, higher level, going to take a lot more, you know, a lot more time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| money into doing that. But it may save some money overall, because you're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| like you said, having to do one parcel and starting and stopping that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| another starting stopping. So you, so it is a lot more in one, one process. Will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| this diminish the public's ability to have input, feedback, or engagement in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| the process in any way, shape, or form, whether it be through planning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| through the development directly? Not to my knowledge. The, it's still, the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| thing that can happen through plan development is anything that gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| approved through Knoxville-Nocte County Planning and through County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| So it still has the same public process, but it also has, before that public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| process starts, a, you know, more, you know, kind of a more intensive planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| session. And does the public have access to the intensive planning on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| end as well, or is it still, is their point of entry still planning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| commission? I believe the point of entry would be before that, in the planning part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| but I think the staff might be able to talk more about what parts would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| available and what parts would be noticed. There are some other things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| here about notice that are clearly set out. The mailed and posted notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| required when the concept plan is to be presented, and things like that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| there are some extra, you know, besides like a rezoning process, there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| other points where the public will be noticed. Thank you for the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Commissioner Smith? I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| this lady wants to speak. Ma'am, who else wanted to speak? Yes, ma'am. Yeah, go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| ahead, and please, I'm sorry, go ahead, please approach the podium and just state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| your name and address for the record, please. Corinne Ravetti, 6925 Sevierville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| Pike. So I'm here representing both Keep the Urbanist Wilderness Peaceful and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| on the Knox County Planning Alliance. And I would like to just emphasize that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| recommendations that we made, that Kevin made earlier for, from the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Planning Alliance, to really take the time to consider that. That it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| taking the time before you approve an ordinance, rather than having to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| later and make recommendations or make changes later. There's no rush. Take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| time to consider those recommendations, which we think are good ones that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| change the context of the plan development, which is a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| concept, because it does apply for sort of multi-use of a piece of property. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| think it would be really good if maybe Tom Breschko has some examples of plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| development, so that we have a better sense of what that really means. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| understanding, when we spoke with Gerald Green and Liz Albertson a while back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| that the closest thing that it seems in Knoxville that comes to a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| development would be sort of like the Sequoia Hills area, where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| residences, there's commercial property, you know, commercial usage, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| amenities in terms of, you know, walking areas, etc. So it's kind of a, you know, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| overall concept. The way that it's written, in our opinion, does seem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| remove some of the basic criteria of zoning and kind of eviscerates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=758)|
| 0:12:47| need for a rezoning application. So we want to be sure that that's not seen as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| a substitute, that somebody can't get rezoning in an area, so okay, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| to go for plan development. It should have some of those same criteria that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| apply, in that we really need, I think we need a standard process. And though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| flexibility is an important part of this, it seems to me that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| provides a little too much flexibility. It's a little too squishy in areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| then open a door for potential manipulation, malalignment of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| project, a little too much political influence, rather than really looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| a plan development project that would be beneficial to a community. It's in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| opinion that ordinances should not encourage, but should establish and demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| that standards are met. You know, again, this is where it feels a little too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| squishy in that we encourage, we encourage, and it just seems that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| allows too much latitude for misuse there. So that's all I have to say at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| moment. And it would really be helpful, I think, if Tom, maybe you can provide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| some other examples of plan development. Because right now, I think we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| that there is one project that's in queue that really does not seem to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| the criteria. We're talking about a commercial resort for tourists trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| be put into a residential area. And that just really does not seem to meet any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| the criteria for plan development. And I think if it's going to be a precedent, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| we're looking to establish an ordinance, that the first project that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| should not set a precedence for misuse of this ordinance. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| All right, thank you. Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Tom or Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| He sent you, didn't he? Kevin and the previous lady both listed some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=890)|
| 0:15:06| they would like to see. I will assume, and you correct me if I'm wrong, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| these changes were brought to the MPC staff. Yes, I believe all of these have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| been discussed at some point amongst staff, as well as at the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Commission. And the staff didn't recommend these changes? I'd have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| back and look, but no, I believe that none of these were recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| Okay, and then they were brought up again at the MPC Commissioner's meeting? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| believe so, yes. And the Commission didn't vote to change it either. Could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| you tell us the reason why staff nor MPC Commission chose to make these changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| Well, they chose not to. Yes. I think that the process that was laid out was, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| know, our recommendations didn't include these because we did want to maintain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| high level of flexibility. I can't speak to why the Planning Commission chose not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| to incorporate these. I'd have to look back at some detail and discussion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| there was discussion about there was lots of discussion. We discussed this for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| a number of months leading up to the recommendation that was sent to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Mr. Jay. Hi, quick question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=986)|
| 0:16:36| exactly where it is in the ordinance. You may be able to find it faster than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| will, but there's a section that talks about the optional concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| versus a mandatory concept plan. Can you help us understand that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| more? It seems to me if somebody was coming together, coming with a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| development, that they would have a concept plan for that plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| And why that would be optional, it would seem to me that as part of the due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| diligence of both the public and of county officials, that you would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| to have somebody required to actually put together a conceptual plan and show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| that to you before you got permission. It seems weird to be optional versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| mandatory. Yes, so that is one that staff felt could go either way, that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| support a mandatory concept plan. That one was discussed amongst the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| planning commissioners that there might be cost associated with that. That would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| be too much of a burden to potential applicants, but it's staff's opinion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| we think that that would be something that would be fine. Because as it reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| with optional, somebody could ask for this particular, to be under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| particular ordinance with a plan, but then essentially not show what that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| is until way down the road. And I think from staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| perspective, and you know most of these projects are going to be very large, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| talking 10 acres or more, it's gonna be very elaborate, that it would be our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| recommendation that, you know, come forward as early as possible, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| engage with the community, share your ideas with staff and the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| commission, so at the end of the day you end up having a better project. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| that's something that this commission ought to really think about it, of making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| the one amendment to be a mandatory versus optional. I just, I can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| how somebody developing 10 acres or more with a very, very specialized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| designation would not come to the table at the beginning of the process with, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| know, I don't know what you're saying, John, but you can weigh in here. I just, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| don't understand how you could not come to it with a concept plan and then go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| through the entire process and introduce that later. That this, if you're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| for a special circumstance, then you should be able to justify what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| special circumstance is on the front end as to what you're doing. Just doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| seem to make sense, and I think we ought to really think through that. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Commissioner J. Commissioner, now both Schoonmaker and Smith. Yeah, just what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| referencing is in the middle of page 3. Okay, thank you. Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Thank you. At some point a concept plan has to come forward, right? Correct. Correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1145)|
| 0:19:14| and I think the optional part of that is if you put a lot of money up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| and your idea doesn't get traction or goes through changes, we are in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| sense driving up the cost for that tenant, homeowner, or whoever ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| purchases that land. Is the concept to wait until we know that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| something that's going to go through before we require the concept plan? No, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| think the concept plan, it doesn't necessarily have to be... Would the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| draft be... Draft, it's a draft plan. Ideas, schematics, you know, thinking about broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| concepts, have a written description of what you want to do and what you hope to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| achieve, so it doesn't have to be like what we think of as engineering plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| and the detail is much less. So it's not the same concept you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| bring back for approval right now? No, it would be different, or it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| could be. It just depends. So this is a brand new process that's not been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| place in Knox County or the city of Knoxville, so it is different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| what we've had in the past. Do you know about other areas that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| adopted this approach? I do not know specific jurisdictions and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| I know that Director Green has more knowledge about specific jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| Okay, thank you. Yeah, one thing I might weigh in here on is, you know, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| talking about, is there any examples kind of locally or close proximities to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| something like this has been done or could have been done? And I believe I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| mentioned this last week, or excuse me, last month, and I want to go back, I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| remember if our newer... I don't think our newer commissions were on this body, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| if y'all recall, Oliver Smith brought a plan to us that was really hard, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| had a church property with a sports field and some scholastic function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| zoned up there around church, so it also was adjacent with some areas that was ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| You had intention to put residential area in that area, then you had potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916publichearing?start=1283)|
