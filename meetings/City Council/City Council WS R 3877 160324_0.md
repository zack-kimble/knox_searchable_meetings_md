| 0:00:52| Thank you. Tonight we're here for the workshop to hear about the mobile food units, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=52)|
| 0:00:59| going to jump right into that. I'm going to have some closing remarks, a couple of announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| that I'd like to make at the end, but I'd like to go ahead and get started. Go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| and turn it over to Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| Thank you, Vice Mayor Grieve and Council, for coming and for all the folks from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| public who have joined us. I'm only going to take a couple of minutes and then turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| it over to the folks who have done such hard and great work on that, Patricia and Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Just to give a bit of background, a number of years ago we noticed here that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| seeing the fruits of a national phenomenon. Things that were popping up all over became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| you see reference to them on TV, see them in other cities, and that was a plethora of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| entrepreneurs who were taking up delivering food and selling food to trucks. The food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| truck phenomenon or mobile food units came before us in looking at it in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| and then realizing here of course that we were experiencing the same food trucks wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| to do business and doing business in Knoxville. Now as many times we in the public sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| and trying to keep up with things, we find ourselves in the unenviable position of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| having the capacity to do what we need to do to A, allow the businesses to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| That is we had no legal way to let a food truck operate on one hand, and on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| hand since they were operating, especially in public spaces where the biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| was, we also had the concern that we had no way to ensure public safety or the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| interest with their operation. So what we needed to do was find A, a way to allow food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| trucks to operate, and B, a way to have meaningful and reasonable and effective regulations from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| them. Now this, as if we needed a little more encouragement, some went into this, turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| on the news one day and witnessed an exploding food truck in Philadelphia, you may recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| seeing that, and that got our attention that that was probably a less than desirable outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| So we, a number of us in the administration, Mayor O'Hara made it clear to us and we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| agreed we need to get on top of this situation and find a way and encourage food trucks because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| my bias and our bias was the community is a better place with food trucks and with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| variety and encouraging this kind of activity and we wanted a way to find a way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| and find a way to do it right. So we embarked on a large public process which I think is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| was a very good one and I feel very, very proud of the way that our staff has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| on this, Rick Emmett who wasn't able to be here today, Patricia Robledo, Krista Kukuro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| in putting this together and going through myriad public meetings, stakeholder meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| and trying to get an ordinance together that was the best for the city. What, I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| one thing before I start, we anticipated the original stakeholders were largely the bricks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| and mortar versus food trucks, we thought, but really that hasn't proven to be as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| of a concern. Bricks and mortar restaurant owners were satisfied with some of our resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| and we haven't really heard from them as a party with an interest in becoming further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| involved but we have had neighborhood organizations as we've extended this into the, extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| the reach of the food trucks out of the downtown area and you will hear, you have heard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| will hear more from them as well as from the food truck operators themselves. So with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| in mind, I'm going to turn it over to Patricia and Krista will say that we did begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| as all good public policy enterprises ought to begin with a road trip and that road trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| took us to Nashville and we began with looking at great detail into how Nashville's worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| what their problems were, they were incredibly helpful to us in anticipating what some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| the issues would be and from then we came back and began the long and somewhat arduous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| process and I guess I will turn it over to Patricia to go over the timeline and to Krista| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| to talk about the actual ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| Good evening, Patricia Robledo, Office of Business Support. So I may repeat some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| the things that Dr. Lyons said, going into best practices and when we look at the National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| League of Cities and sort of their recommendations on how to do a food truck program, we kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| of check marked all of those, thanks to Dr. Lyons' guidance, we were able to do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| of these things that you see on this slide. We held meetings, we partnered for relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=337)|
| 0:05:47| we implemented the program, the pilot program and we are now with this new ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=347)|
| 0:05:57| we're proposing, we are targeting those underserved areas that are in need of different kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| of foods and such. And then the last one is kind of working on it right now with MPC trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| to look into food truck parks which exist in other cities. In 2013, a couple of food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=372)|
| 0:06:20| truck owners came to me and said, you know, we'd like to look into creating standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=380)|
| 0:06:31| and expanding business opportunities. So as Dr. Lyons said, we decided this was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| idea, we knew that food trucks were here anyway and they were growing in popularity and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| were already working really with no standards that we knew of except hopefully a health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| permit from the health department. So it made sense to be supportive of these entrepreneurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| that add to the vibrancy of our city and support the buy local trend. This would also send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| a message that the city supports the incubation and growth of startup businesses and is willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| to be able to update ordinances to make Knoxville a friendly business city. So we started researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| different jurisdictions, different cities. In July of 2013, we held the first public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| meeting to let people know we were going to work on a food truck program, a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| In August, there was a conference call to the city of Nashville followed by a trip with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| both Deputy to the Mayor, Dr. Lyons and Chris Srebrenskam, Rick Emmett and myself went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| Nashville. The city of Nashville was extremely gracious and shared with us some lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| and the way they did things and we used a lot of what they did. We mirror a lot of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| they did. And in November, you approved the amendment that would authorize us to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| the rules and regulations. In early 2014, we formed an advisory group. We knew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| none of us in the city were restaurant owners, whether brick and mortar or mobile. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| wanted those voices at the table to come up with an ordinance that would make sense, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| pilot program that would make sense. We had numerous meetings and communications with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| this advisory group as well as many city of Knoxville departments including law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| downtown coordinator, traffic engineering, stormwater engineering, KPD, KFD, plans reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| zoning, electrical, special events, communications, etc. As well as outside regulatory agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| like KUB and the health department. In March, we went to the public to introduce a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| and at that meeting we heard some comments and we took them, came back and tweaked a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| little bit the program. So we've always been very open. It's been an open process and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| been willing to make changes based on feedback. And now we are two years into the pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| and so I'm happy to say that it has been a very positive program. We now have 29 permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=561)|
| 0:09:33| food trucks. So we know that we have 29 food trucks that are safe for the environment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| for the public and we feel really good about that. There have been a couple of challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| with the pilot program in that it's been hard for it to have enforcement capability for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=585)|
| 0:09:57| those food trucks that are not permitted and have not come under the program. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| the other one has to do with the zones downtown. Those have been challenging a little bit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| navigate because we're not used by food trucks. Cars park there and then if a food truck shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| up and then so we ticket it and sometimes have towed and we try to avoid that by getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| public service to put out cones when a food truck schedules the zone. But we knew Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| had the same problem and so it didn't surprise us. This is something that is difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| kind of navigate. And I see many people here today and thank you all for coming. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| like to recognize Edwin Wong, who has been just terrific in helping us schedule those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| food truck zones out of the goodness of his heart. And so with that I'll just give it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| over to Krista to go through the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you. I'm Krista Cucrow, City Law Department. And as Patricia and Dr. Lyons said, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=660)|
| 0:11:09| to talk about the substance of the ordinance. And with any good ordinance, the crux is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| in the definition. So we'll start out there talking about what we mean when we say an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| MFU or a food truck. So the definition that's proposed in the ordinance is that an MFU is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| an enclosed unit, truck, trailer, or other similar vehicle-mounted unit that is mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| or capable of being moved, may be independent with respect to water, wastewater, power utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| but not necessarily, is used for the preparation, sale, or donation of on-site prepared food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| and does not exceed 35 feet in length and 9 feet in width. And the on-site prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| food is another term that's defined in the ordinance that I think is important here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| On-site prepared food is basically any food or beverage that is prepared within the unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| or within an external unit nearby to the MFU. So we're talking about brewing coffee, smoking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| barbecue, warming biscuits. There's a lot that's encompassed in that term, prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| food. So I would encourage you to take a look at the other definitions in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| That's what we're talking about. We also have some other types of vendors in the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| and those are regulated under Chapter 16, and that really gets into the licenses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| how those businesses operate. That's where we have the pedestrian vendors. It's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| where we have regulations on pawnbrokers and other similar kind of second-hand sellers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| of goods. So that's what we're talking about here as far as the location of where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| ordinance is going to be. It's going to be in Chapter 16 with those other types of vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| And if you'll go back really quick, I'm going to talk a little bit more about these specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| types of vendors. The city code does not address ice cream trucks specifically, and through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| this ordinance we've imposed a couple of requirements for those trucks, such as where they can stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| to vend as far as where they are in relation to an intersection, what roadways they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| stop on, the speed limit being 30 miles per hour or less. And an ice cream truck may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| to come within the MFU permitting program depending on how it's operating. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| that gets back to the definition of prepared food. We've got prepackaged food, so if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| just giving prepackaged food that's wrapped in plastic, little popsicles, that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| not something that they're preparing there on site. But if they're scooping ice cream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| from tubs, that would be preparing. And if they want to be stationary for more than 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| minutes at a time, they're going to have to come within the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| We also have pedestrian vendors that are regulated under Chapter 16, and those are vendors with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| very small carts. It's about three feet by six feet is the dimension of those carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| And they have to remain in motion when they're making a sale, and they're only limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| operating within the parameters of specific events. So we've got these other types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| vendors that are regulated under Chapter 16, and again, that's where we're looking to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| this. Because most of these vending regulations for MFUs focus on the licensing procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| and the operational procedures and not land use or design, a lot of jurisdictions choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| to put these in a similar category of code or ordinances. And that's not the case across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| the board. Some jurisdictions have put these ordinances within their zoning code, but by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| and large, it's within these sort of vendor regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| So I'm going to talk about what we require as far as making an application for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| And we have two types of permits. We have a unit permit, which is essentially good for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| a year, and then a temporary permit, which is good for three consecutive days within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| a year. And someone is only allowed to apply for that twice in a year. So they could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| operate more than six days within a year, but that permit is good for three consecutive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| days. And our rationale there was a lot of times for special events, we've got local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| food trucks who are interested in operating, but sometimes we have trucks coming from out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| of town, whether that's Johnson City, Nashville, Asheville, and we want those food trucks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| comply with our regulations out of fairness to the folks who are based here and out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| consideration of safety for the public. We want everyone to be on the same page and following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| the same regulations. But we recognize that those folks may just come to Knoxville once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| and we didn't want to charge them the full $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Either way, the application requirements include what you see here. Proof of various licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| such as driver's licenses, health department licenses, business licenses, information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| their vehicle, information about their food preparation, insurance certificates, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| have to sign an indemnification certificate. As part of the application process, they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| go through several inspections, and those are included in the price of that permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| for those unit permits. And that includes a fire inspection and an electrical inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| And those cover things like fire extinguishers, ventilation and suppression systems, if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| going to be cooking with food that produces grease-laden vapors, storage and labeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| of propane, and various aspects of their wiring. And then once someone has that unit permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| that annual permit, they can renew that every year for $50, provided that they've continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| to follow all the regulations and that they renew within five days of their expiration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Most certainly, they can't just come back at any time and say, I'm ready to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| Okay, so where can MFUs operate? We've got this sort of in two different spheres, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| you will. We have city right of way and other public property, which I'll talk about under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| the open space districts. And then we have private property. And we've classified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| by zoning district, just to say where these trucks can go and set up temporarily. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| got commercial, the form code district, South Waterfront, and Cumberland, industrial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| open space, office, residential. And all of these latter districts here, all the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| districts, except for residential, of course, are subject to a 100-foot boundary. And what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| that means is, if there's a food truck set up on a property that is nearby to a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| that's zoned residential, that food truck must be 100 feet from the boundary of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| residential property, regardless of the use on that residential property. We didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| to get into the minutia of what's happening on the property. When does it become a residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| So if it's zoned residential, a food truck operating in any of the other districts has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| to be 100 feet from the boundary of that property. And that requirement can be waived. I'll talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| about that after I go through all the districts. So we'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Okay, so first we've got the right of way. As Patricia mentioned, we have some zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| in downtown Knoxville. We currently have five of those. And the most popular location is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| right here on Main Street in front of the Bank of America building. We have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| food trucks that set up there and kind of cater to the lunchtime downtown business crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Reservations are made for those downtown zones through the Knoxville Mobile Restaurant Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| And you can look at that at the website provided here, and you can see where mobile food trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| are going to be. And not necessarily just for the zones. This is sort of an advertisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| for them essentially. It's a calendar for the month, and it shows where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| to be and when. So you can go on there and see when they're going to be operating and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| where. And then as Patricia mentioned, she works with public service, and they mark those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| spaces in the downtown zones for reservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Okay, now getting into the districts. We've got commercial, industrial, and form code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| zones, and those are all listed there. And in those districts, there's an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| restriction, which is the food trucks cannot operate from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. So basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| between those hours, they can't operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| How'd you come up with 2 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| That's when bars close. And so, you know, we have a lot of activity downtown as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| as bars, and so that's when they close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| For open space districts, those are areas zoned OS-1 and OS-2. And for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| these are city parks that are owned by the City of Knoxville, but that's not the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| for all of them. We have a couple country clubs and golf courses that are included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| this zoning district. And so for those properties that are not owned by the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| the MFU operator will have to get permission from the owner of the property before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| can set up there. And if that's the case, if it's not owned by the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| they are prohibited from operating from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| And then for those properties zoned OS that are owned by the City of Knoxville, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| most of our parks, MFUs will comply with the rules that are proposed to be adopted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| regulate operation in city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| And here's a list of those parks and these rules, these proposed rules, and the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| and the designated areas within those parks where the trucks can operate. These are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| available online with little handy-dandy maps, but this is just a quick list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| And I'll just go over these really briefly. Reservations are required for the food trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| to operate in city parks, and at any given time, a food truck can only have two reservations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| across the city parks. And that's something we do with the downtown zones as well. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| don't want someone just reserving every single Thursday for the rest of the year because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| they know it's a great day to be downtown. They can only have two reservations at any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1297)|

| 0:23:04| And then we have the office districts. They're listed here. And in these districts, MFUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| are prohibited from operating on parcels that are smaller than two acres in size, prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1390)|

| 0:24:02| trucks come onto their property for a private event. That's something that's been happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1442)|

| 0:24:15| As I mentioned earlier, there's a waiver of the restrictions of the time or the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| restrictions. And in order for this to be accomplished, the food truck would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| obtain written permission from all of the property owners on that residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1465)|

| 0:24:44| For the time restriction, again, if it's commercial and they're operating until 2 a.m. but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| want to operate until 4 a.m. I'm not sure why they would want to do that. But if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| want to operate until 4 a.m., that would be a waiver of the time restriction and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| would have to get permission from the property owners within 200 feet. So, you know, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| on what they're looking to accomplish there. But we wanted to add that to provide some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| flexibility because we realize property is zoned in so many different ways throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| the city, it's hard to sort of come up with something that works for everyone. You may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| have a neighborhood or nearby businesses that are really supportive of some type of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| and so we wanted to provide that flexibility. We've also added a maximum number of food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| trucks per parcel. We heard some concerns about traffic and congestion on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| setback issues, things like that. And so we decided after looking at some other jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| that this was a good way to address that. Based on the size of the lot, only a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| number of food trucks are permitted to operate. There is a bit of a waiver provided in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| If it's an event approved by the Office of Special Events, then that maximum doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1561)|

| 0:26:42| if we receive some complaints we would be looking into that. And just as a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| terminology, the operator, we've defined that so it's a little bit flexible depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| how the property is managed. So if there's a property where there's only one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| owner or one tenant, the permission could come from either the property owner or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1621)|

| 0:27:27| we wanted to give the property owner the final say. Additionally, recognizing that that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1647)|

| 0:32:38| to cover this. To date, we haven't really had much in the way of complaints other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| permitted trucks complaining about unpermitted trucks, as you might imagine. But vending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| without a permit is going to be subject to a $50 penalty. And per our code, any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| violation of the ordinance once it's adopted would also be subject to a $50 penalty. During| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| business hours, complaints will be handled through the plans review and inspections department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| as the permitting department. They'll investigate those, they'll handle those, refer as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| If it's a stormwater issue, they'll send it along to engineering. But they'll be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| to handle it on a day-to-day basis. As you all know, our plans review staff doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| work beyond business hours, although they're doing the Saturday pilot program. So after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| hours, KPD is going to handle some minimal enforcement of the ordinance. And what I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| by that is they're going to be kind of identifying the easy stuff, the low-hanging fruit. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| the food truck have a permit or not? Are they using sound amplification or not? Those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| that would be easily identifiable for them. Otherwise, KPD is going to refer an alleged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| violation to the plans review staff who will follow up on it and investigate. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| the ordinance. We're happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you. I want to compliment the staff. I think you all have done a fantastic job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| and obviously done a lot of work. I know you've had numerous public meetings and gotten a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| lot of input. I applaud you for your patience and the thoroughness with which you've approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| this. A couple of questions, though. One, you've sort of addressed, and that is enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2062)|
| 0:34:31| And the other, early on in the presentation, you were talking about the type of trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| The sandwich trucks, the old ones you used to see at construction sites and apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| still do, are they included in this? Basically, it's a pickup truck with a metal bin on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| back and it opens up and maybe there's some heat source. I don't know. But they serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| sandwiches. This has been going on for all of my life. A million years. Is this part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| of the ordinance as well? And then enforcement. I know there's some concern down in the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| area, especially with the construction going on down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| I'll go ahead and tackle that. As far as those trucks, the sandwich trucks, I think we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| have to look at specifically how they're operating, whether they have a heating unit in them or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| not. And we've heard a little bit of what you're talking about. And I'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| we know the specifics. And so it would just be a matter of what's kind of going on inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Well, in fact, there's nobody in that. The vendor stands outside the truck, simply opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| the wings up, and the construction workers or whoever comes by and buys a sandwich and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| a soda pop or whatever. So they're not really inside the truck. It's a very small unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| Doesn't sound like it would fall within our program, but we can look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| You'll find those over at UT at some of the construction sites. They not only show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| in the morning with biscuits and this sort of thing, but then also at lunchtime they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| show up on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you. Just to footnote what he was saying, I mean, you see them come around. In a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| of places, they pull up towards the front door of a commercial operation or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| and beep the horn, and people have about five or ten minutes to get out there and grab a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| biscuit, a sandwich, some fruit, whatever they want. But like he said, it is not a food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| truck that serves through a window. It literally is just a truck with racks in it and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| an outer gate that opens and closes so that the food is not exposed when he's driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| down the highway. And they've been around forever, but you've got to decide whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| they're in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| One question I have is, how do you know whether someone's permitted or not? I mean, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| an event happening in town. Somebody gets in their truck in Oak Ridge or someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| pulls up and starts serving food. Who's going to enforce that? Does it take a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| And it happens to be during business hours and it wakes up the inspection staff? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| how does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Well, we do have permits that have to be displayed in the window. I didn't mention that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| we've got one color is the unit, the annual permit, and then another color is the temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| permit. And so those are going to be readily identifiable or absent. You know, if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2247)|
| 0:37:37| did see that there was not a permit in a window, we would encourage them to call whichever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| entity would be appropriate at the time of the day, and then we would go out and check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Okay. But it ends up being phone call or complaint driven because there isn't a roving inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| looking at food trucks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| I think Krista did bring up that we have the main enforcement we've had lately has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| from permitted trucks noting that there are unpermitted trucks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| They didn't like the competition, so they called them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| All right. The question I had started to ask before but was told to bide my time was, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| these smokers, I've had more phone calls and e-mails about why should we allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| to tow around smokers and smoke up the neighborhood, choke the neighbors sitting on their patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| a hundred feet away or whatever? Why can't they do their food prep and then load it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| the truck and go to the event, unless it's, you know, in a park and it's an all-day event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| and they've got a cook to serve. I mean, but if you're running around serving lunch or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| dinner, why haul the smoking cooker around and subject somebody to noxious fumes? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2327)|
| 0:38:57| that's the question I've been asked. How did you address that? Why didn't you prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Well, I think one of the things I mentioned earlier was that, you know, we talked to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| County, their air quality management division, and they exempt cooking operations and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| does the state of Tennessee. And so we felt that it would be inappropriate to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| here. You know, smoking is not necessarily prohibited citywide. It's something that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| can do, you know, in your backyard. You can smoke meat. I think the reality of the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| trucks is they're not going to be set up for extended periods of time. You know, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| mobile. They've got a lot of customers. They're moving from place to place to get around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| city. You know, it's certainly, I think they're going to be moving. And so they're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| to be there for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| I saw one restriction in a public park. You got four hours or something, but I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| see time restrictions other than 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. or 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in certain places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| So you could be there 12, 15 hours, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| You could be. And certainly that's how it's drafted. I just don't know if that's how food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| trucks operate typically. And from my understanding of them is that would not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| I would say a lot of this is based on our experience in the pilot program here. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| we've had a reasonable amount of experience and also did a lot of talking to other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| about problems that would emerge. And these two really haven't been identified. We haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| had any feedback or any problems with these. That's not saying they couldn't happen, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| I think the reality is the probability of the smoking, you know, getting out of hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2440)|
| 0:40:49| and getting in and wafting around to neighborhoods is pretty low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| Now, it's nothing, I think it's something we keep our eye on with implementation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| all of these to see if problems arise. And I think also, as Krista said, the whole model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| the business model, and you may hear from some of these folks otherwise, is to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| and go at different mealtimes and so forth rather than to just keep operating all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| long. But I don't know that we see that that's necessarily problematic in the locations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| they'll be if they do operate longer hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Well, I did see one truck and it didn't have a smoker, but it was out on the airport motor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| mile and it would stop in front of the various car dealerships and the sales people and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| repair folks would have, you know, 10 or 15 minutes to run out, get their lunch, and drag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| it back inside rather than get in the car and drive to a fast food place. And then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| assume that vendor moves on to the next likely spot to sort of open up his trade. That seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| to work fairly well. It was a stop and pass through the window thing. But that is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| different than sort of having a smoker and possibly having wind drift into someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| property and annoying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Well, let me ask you, there was also a debate about 100 feet and 200 feet from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2523)|

| 0:42:19| Our initial ordinance, the first one that we sent to you, was 50 feet from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| zones. And we heard from different folks, particularly Community Forum, being upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| that it was too close to residential. And I think they had proposed 300 feet maybe or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| more or not do office districts and such. And so as a way of compromising, we put 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2560)|
| 0:42:50| feet. But we felt very comfortable with the 50 feet, and that's what we had initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| All right. I'll let someone else ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I think what I've seen out in the suburbs, anyway, I see them working really well. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| serving drinking establishments and beer gardens and markets. It's where, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| I've observed, anyway, is where they, I think those owners had probably invited a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| food truck or one to come to their establishment. So they're kind of almost become the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| of that and the overseer of that. And I'm sure that if that food truck becomes or that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| operator becomes difficult to deal with or doesn't deliver a good product, then they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| going to be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| So it's on an invited basis, which seems to me a lot different than the guy that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| shows up on, you know, at the park or on the side of the street. I mean, I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| that person would want and probably has, as you call it, shore power. And that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| And to me, I think there probably are situations where the distance requirement might be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| little bit restrictive. The two things that seem to be that people are opposed to on why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| would you oppose the distance requirement when that question is asked, it seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| the smoker and the generator. And so if you had shore power, the generator would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| Some of these barbecue places around town that aren't food trucks but that are barbecue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| places, they use the smoker for marketing. They're not cooking on that smoker. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| just using it to wafe, as Mr. DellaVopi once said about smoke and odor, to wafe across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| the roads as a way to draw marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2678)|

| 0:44:42| You said wafe. I'll never forget the word wafe when you said that. So, you know, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| if they're using that on a food truck, I'm not sure that that would be appropriate. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| mean, if they're really cooking with that, that's one thing. If it's just using it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| marketing, I would question whether a smoker is really relevant on the back of a 35-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| vehicle that has a gas tank already and so forth. So, I don't know. I think that's, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| then the other thing, is it true, and I couldn't exactly find it or point me to where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| where these vendors are allowed to set up tables and chairs outside the truck. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| also in there? Was that, that was not in the pilot or was in the pilot? What page is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| It is allowed on private property so long as they remove it at the end of their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| Let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Was that in the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| I actually don't recall. Patricia says she doesn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Food trucks have been going on to, you know, private property and setting up and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| these sorts of things, you know, prior to our even engaging with this. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| part of it as well because of the nature of private property and the fact that there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| no regulations. And I will probably have a lot of that that we don't even know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| But do you think, I mean, do you think that allowing them to set up tables and chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| is, are there other unintended consequences that might come with that and other unintended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| regulations that might come with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Handicap, I mean, what else, I mean, does that bring in any of that? I mean, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| know, but I'm just asking the question. I don't have the answer. But that would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| seem to draw a little bit different crowd than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| So I don't know, but I mean, I think the smoker, I mean, you can ask the vendors, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| are they using it to actually cook or are they using it to, for, I'll say, marketing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| Or, you know, and is that really necessary? I mean, have you heard from the vendors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| have said, oh yeah, we have to have this? I mean, if that seems to be an issue, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| I think, I think right now we've got three barbecue trucks and I think that they all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| operate differently. I know one of them uses a barrel smoker, which is also called a stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| burner, which I think is cooking the meat. One of them is using a vapor tray, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| you know, in that regard, I'm not sure that the, what's coming out at the top is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| smoke or if it's vapor. So they all operate differently. I don't know that I can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| that question sort of across the board. That might be a better question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Even some barbecue caterers, they don't use it. I mean, they pull that out there and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| using it for, to create the ambiance. And I mean, I don't know if that's, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| where it backs up to residential units, that, and maybe even offices, I don't know if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2860)|

| 0:47:43| The barbecue truck, the one that I'm familiar with, really they do their barbecue cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| elsewhere and they really use the smoker to cook hot dogs and hamburgers, you know, type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| of thing. They don't use it to really do the barbecue on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2873)|

| 0:47:58| Yes, I wanted to ask a question about the downtown food trucks and parking and how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| they're going to be allowed to park in various locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| We have different times for different zones. We have some lunch zones and some late night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| zones. We have, we have chosen to do away with one food truck zone by Ongay Street by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| the Visitor Center because it became kind of an issue. It's not being used. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| sure that we will identify more zones or change zones, but we would leave that, I think, flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| because we need to kind of be responsive to what's working or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| When you all went to Nashville for a field trip, did you go to any other cities other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2926)|

| 0:49:30| consent of all property owners within 200 feet of where the MFU desires to operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| Binding, is that like a variance or is that, I mean, I don't know how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| I think we're anticipating them providing written documentation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=2983)|

| 0:50:03| statement, but, so when you talk about these folks, the rogues, if you will, that can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| in from parts unknown and set up at a festival and, you know, they don't have the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| certification to be there, it's Saturday at 6 o'clock, well, what are we going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| I mean, what happens? Who comes out and causes a problem, you know, cites them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| Well, if it's a special event, we typically do have inspectors from KFD, the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| who are there inspecting, you know, the tents and all the cooking that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| So they would definitely get caught at a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| If it's some other type of event, I think that would be a little bit more challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| because they're just sort of coming in for the day, but, you know, I think that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| we rely on what Dr. Lyons was talking about earlier, you know, there's presumably going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3055)|

| 0:51:05| I think we also, excuse me, Councilman, we also need to do some public education on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| as well and let people know that, you know, food trucks are supposed to be permitted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| where those permits are so we can hear from people about these because we can't just rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| on, you know, the other food trucks, so that would be, but that is a difficulty, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| just no way around that, some of it's going to slip through the cracks for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| And I certainly am a huge proponent of small businesses and it's, my understanding was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| it would be like a $50 fine if they were caught, I mean, that's a pittance if, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| know, if it's dependent on the area and, I mean, yeah, go ahead, charge me $50, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3098)|

| 0:51:52| had a vote on a number of years ago and didn't make, but you're right, that is a cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| doing business to some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Yeah, and, you know, I just say that I'm really supportive of this moving forward and it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| like there may be movement on it or whatever, but I really think that these trucks, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| mobile units, and as we all travel throughout larger cities and now even smaller cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3128)|

| 0:53:46| impact. I just, you know, I just want to make sure, and I hear things around this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| that I think are warranted, that please let's not stifle it so much. I mean, these are small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3233)|

| 0:54:25| come up, we can always go back and change them. So, let's not make it so, the barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| to entry so stiff. We've got 29 operating, I understand, we've got four pending, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3272)|

| 0:54:49| as well, I'm not sure about that, but, so, let's move forward with it and get this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you. I also want to dovetail with what Mr. Pavlis says. I notice, especially down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3296)|

| 0:55:20| it's used quite a bit, and people seem to enjoy it, so I agree with what Nick says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| that we don't want to stifle this, but at the same time, we do want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| our neighborhoods are protected and this sort of thing. You had mentioned, I think, earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| and I may have misunderstood this, that you are looking into the possibility of food truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| sites or parks. I know, having been in Austin a number of times, that they literally, along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| some of their major corridors, have actual sites that food trucks are parked there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| they have the picnic area and that sort of thing, and, Patricia, are you looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Yes, along with MPC, we're starting to look at sort of the same thing with the food trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| best practices around the country, and seeing what zones would support this type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3364)|
| 0:56:12| And the other question I have, and I think you touched on this lightly, that during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| pilot program that you've had, it seems that, from what I understand, that both the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| truck operators and the bricks and mortar restaurants have gotten along well. You haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| received that many complaints or any complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| I have not received any complaints from brick and mortars at all. I think you are correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| with the symbiotic relationship that food trucks have with beer markets. That's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3394)|
| 0:56:43| happening a lot. You know, we're seeing a lot of breweries pop up because we changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| the zoning ordinance to allow for that, so it's a win-win. But no, brick and mortars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| have not complained at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| See, we had lots of concern originally from bricks and mortar very much, and in one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| our original meetings, there was a lot of, they were represented along with the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| truck folks, and everybody listened and adjusted in the placement of the zones, took some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| their concerns into account. But since they have been satisfied, and as Patricia said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| and sort of exited the discussion and been quite happy with what's gone on. I will add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| one more thing, but I know we want to have more discussion, and it goes on a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| about what Councilman Pavlis and then what Vice Mayor Grieve said. There's so much creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| and entrepreneurship around food and food preparation, and there's this changing dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| of how people, with the beer gardens and the breweries, and as things are rapidly moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| But this allows the entrepreneurs to get into this space, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| with a much lower cost of entry. And some have moved on to bricks and mortar locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| after becoming, starting in the food truck world. So it's something I think, as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| we want to do it right. We want to have the appropriate regulations. But I would concur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| it's something that is a real positive, both for the small business environment and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| encourage the entrepreneurship that we want. And Patricia works very closely and is terrific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| about bringing that along. But of all the places you see people wanting to start a business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| get engaged in finding an opportunity, this is a real natural, both here and around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| So we definitely want to keep up with that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| Right. Thank you. Well, you folks are to be commended for what you're presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Are any other, I was going to say, are there any other questions? Mr. Delvopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| Yeah, thank you. Just curious, how do we collect taxes from these entities? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| they have sale tax and maybe business property tax. Do we have enforcement of that on food trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| or is that just a loophole? I am not the tax attorney, but I will say they have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| you know, business licenses through the county and the city, and I presume that it's handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| through that mechanism as far as collecting the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| To that, I'll add that they have a business license from whatever jurisdiction they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| And when they pay taxes to the state, then the state gives money back to the jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Some of them are not within city of Knoxville limits, so they have just a county license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| or they may be permitted in Blount County or another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| Any other questions? Mr. Patterson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Yeah, just kind of a statement, too. It's cool, and I didn't even think about this when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3574)|

| 0:59:51| and we have the mobile units come up. And it's really kind of cool in that you get a bunch of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3591)|
| 1:00:00| people that generally don't speak to each other congregated outside of the units, and they order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3600)|

| 1:00:23| bit, but it's a different model. Instead of having to get in a car, you know, you got 30 minutes or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3623)|

| 1:01:24| we've opened, and working with the pilot program, making sure to use approved trucks. We've had zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3684)|

| 1:01:36| Mr. Wallace brought up. We are within that 100 feet to some condominiums behind us, and some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3696)|

| 1:01:55| walk past. So I guess our concern was that if this ordinance holds exactly as it is with 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3715)|

| 1:02:30| To make sure that our neighborhood and customers were heard, we did start an online petition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3750)|

| 1:02:49| our concerns have been addressed tonight. I hear some of the same statements from you guys as we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3769)|

| 1:04:09| it's a little bit different. They're really almost managing that food truck, or certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3849)|

| 1:04:17| other places, and it's going to exist some other places. I mean, I think about Sevier Avenue. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3857)|

| 1:05:02| We try to park the food truck behind the retaining wall, so to the actual property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3902)|

| 1:05:15| you know, we sent some letters to the condos because we wanted their input as well, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| they tell us that the retaining wall blocks the sound, it blocks the view. You have to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| walk over to see if anyone is there for the night. So the property line is 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3927)|
| 1:05:36| to where we typically set up. If the setup were changed to the truck to the front of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3936)|

| 1:05:47| the 50 feet requirement would have worked. It would not be as good, I think, for pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| traffic in the plaza and for parking, but it would work. Now, then the condos would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3952)|

| 1:06:26| have it, with the retaining wall, it's, of course, we don't bring any smokers in, so we don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| problems like that. And if we do bring a barbecue truck in, it's already pre-made, so very easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=3990)|

| 1:06:42| and the problem with that is that you have to be careful with each of the trucks. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| different amperage requirements, so that's something that you may want to look at as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4006)|

| 1:11:58| Well, unfortunately, the city of Knoxville is not the business of enforcing business models. It enforces laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| And the law you're looking at would allow exactly that to happen. Now, I think we're in favor of MFUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4325)|

| 1:12:47| Obviously, most of the things we've talked about tonight and seen, we have no objection to. No problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4367)|
| 1:12:55| We've had many discussions and many changes have been made since that first draft in November. But there are a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| things that have not been addressed, and we do feel very strongly about them. Now, we are definitely not opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| food trucks, even though some may think we are. We are not. But we don't think they belong everywhere, particularly if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| have these smokers. Now, I know right now there are very few with smokers, but what's to say six months from now there won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4395)|

| 1:13:27| people. And I say this is a perfect place to cook meat right on the premises. The one place I want to talk about that I think a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| people in this city do not know is that in our parks, you're going to allow smokers in parks. I live in West Hills. I live right near the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4416)|
| 1:13:47| West Hills Park, which has adjoining to it the YMCA, the tennis courts owned by the city, and their swimming pool. I cannot see that if I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4427)|
| 1:13:58| sitting at that swimming pool, I would be very happy to have smoke drifting over the pool and walking through a parking lot. And they're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| very serious safety concerns about these smokers. And it's nice to have a few signs and some cones, but if you have a sudden storm come up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4445)|
| 1:14:15| kids are running crazy to get to cars, you could have some really dangerous situations with those smokers. And what they've got set up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4455)|
| 1:14:24| nothing to protect people. And the university has had problems with grills with people running into them and so on. But we have a lot of parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4464)|
| 1:14:32| And I have a feeling, like I said earlier, most people do not realize that these are even going to be allowed in the parks and that if they have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| smoker, they are not going to be happy about it. So I don't want to repeat everything that Carlene has said. She did a very good job of summarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| But things like the tables and chairs, you're asking for a congregation of a lot of people potentially, even if the mobile food truck doesn't sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4487)|

| 1:15:08| because the people left the club that eventually got shut down to frequent the truck who was allowed to stay there for many hours and caused a lot of noise for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| the people who lived on Sutherland Avenue. So there are issues that you may say, well, right now we don't have a problem. But opening this up like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4518)|
| 1:15:28| ordinance would do, you're going to have some problems. And people who have these houses or offices right next to these places, they don't even realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4528)|
| 1:15:37| what's in this ordinance. And that's when you're going to see some problems. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4537)|

| 1:15:58| What are the implications in terms of grandfathering? Is there any grandfathering implications in this? If we set the distance at 25 feet and then in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4558)|
| 1:16:10| changed it to 100 feet, would anybody be grandfathered into what we pass this time around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4570)|
| 1:16:19| I don't think that they would be. They have a permit and that permit allows them to operate within the rules that we have adopted, the ordinances that we have adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4579)|
| 1:16:31| A lot of the grandfathering sort of comes in with the idea of zoning and uses, and this is not a zoning ordinance. Rob, do you have any additional thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4591)|
| 1:16:46| I was trying to think. If you get a permit for a certain area, but then they leave the area, does that permit expire where the distance requirement later changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4606)|
| 1:17:00| I'm not sure that it would be grandfathered. I don't think that it would be. I think that would be our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| Well, I guess my question, I think it's always good to think about possibilities when you're drafting legislation to think about things that could happen that may not be happening now that could happen in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4626)|
| 1:17:17| and I think that's a good exercise to conduct. I think in this situation, we're going to be able to change that, and I think it's good to encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| We've had these things for two years. I haven't received any complaints about the smell of grilled meat at all, and these smokers are out there, you know, I think typically people love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4644)|
| 1:17:38| I mean, I know a lot of people love the smell of littens when they go to Fountain City, and that's one of their favorite things about Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| so I think it's something to take into consideration. We'll be able to adjust this going forward, and I'm very concerned about the Fountain City casual pine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4663)|
| 1:17:56| It sounds like they've got a great situation, and I think it's good to remind people there's a lot of residents downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| It's pretty much a residential district, and that's where a lot of these food trucks are operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| I mean, I'm not hearing any complaints there, and that's different because they know they're going into that type of situation, but, you know, I think these are amenities that people are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4686)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'm just kind of, Carlene and I were talking earlier today, and I know in Fountain City Park, I'm not sure about West Hills, but you've got grills that are in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4702)|
| 1:18:35| and I'm a pretty good griller, and when I grill, I soak my hickory chips or maple or whatever it might be that I'm going to cook with overnight, and it creates a lot of smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4715)|
| 1:18:49| And, you know, so I could go down to Fountain City Park, set up for the day, I could get there at 8 o'clock, and there's nothing that prohibits me from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4729)|

| 1:23:09| My granny always told me if you smell something, you got something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| And so then therefore it's back to people just moaning and groaning and, you know, put on your big boy pants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=4993)|
| 1:23:23| and come join the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| I sell out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I ain't even worried about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| But the thing of it is is that now I'm looking to take it somewhere else because it don't make no sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5009)|
| 1:23:38| for people complaining this much when we got homeless people out here and poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| and people stealing and doing this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| You know, I was almost homeless at one point after I lost my job off of a mistake that an individual made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| that was in this courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| And it took me a long time to get myself back on track from food stamps to unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| So, you know, I had to do what I had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| And my boss man said, well, listen, you already done made me rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| Ain't nothing I can do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Well, I look at it like it's something I can do for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| The same thing that made you rich will make me richer because I'm the man with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| And my plan was to operate my food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| And to make it the best food truck, I would call season 1975 food truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| and don't have pretty lights and everything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Don't make her any better than any other food truck out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| But she is quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| And quality is what I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| You have one minute, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| But all at the same time, it's my way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| When you taste what I have, you'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| Are you speaking in favor of the ordinance or not in favor of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| I just got here a few minutes ago, so I really don't know what the ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| You want to continue to operate your food truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Ain't no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| I'm going to continue whether I'm downtown or around town or somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| You'll follow the rules that will have come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| I got to see what that is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| You just can't talk to me about no rules and expect me to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| I just wasn't sure which way you were headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| Well, I don't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| So let's just keep it plain and simple and everybody have a nice evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| I hope that one day I see all y'all down on East Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| I'm only there two days a week, Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| And I don't leave no trash, no bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Yes, sir, state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| My name is Edwin Wong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| I live on 7905 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| I believe I'm actually Larry's neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| I just found that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Anyway, I represent the Knoxville Mobile Restaurant Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| I'm the president of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| So I just wanted to first thank the city for all their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| They've been very thorough as we've worked through this process and been very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| I'm really encouraged, actually, to hear today the discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| and I think you guys have a really firm grasp on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| I think Mr. Wallace hit the nail on the head earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| I think what you were saying as far as putting a lot of rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| the way the business model works for the food trucks is majority are invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| So whether it's a business or whether it's an office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| most of the trucks are invited to come do their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| So just like Casual Pine, I think everybody's mentioned, hey, Casual Pine's a great model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| They don't have smoke. They don't use a generator. There's no noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| But that's because Casual Pine, as the owner, is the one saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| hey, for our customers, we don't want them to smell the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| We don't want them to have the noise, be affected by the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| We want to give them a pleasurable experience when they come to our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| So I think that really drives home the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Maybe we don't really need, hey, 100 feet, 50 feet, 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| We just kind of allow the food trucks and allow them to have a chance and opportunity to grow and prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| And I think we maybe give it an opportunity for the private owners or the free market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| just to kind of handle it as opposed to firm or specific rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| So, again, if you need anything, I think I've emailed a few of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| and points on the distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| So just respond to my email if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you very much. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Council, any questions? Do I have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160324_201908?start=5259)|
