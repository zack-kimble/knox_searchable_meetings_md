| 0:01:33| We have Matt Hill from the state, Matthew Hill, from the state comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=93)|

| 0:01:44| we had at our previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Is there a motion or any other amendments that anyone wishes to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=115)|

| 0:01:59| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Next item is approval of our minutes from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=122)|

| 0:02:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| With a proper motion and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=128)|

| 0:02:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Can you see me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Am I really loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| There were some questions in our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| I know that Aubrey from Knox Planning reached out to you with an email and you responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| I don't believe everyone's been privy to that email yet, so if you want to start there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| and then I'll open up the floor for my fellow commissioners for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| And I apologize, you're going to probably have to remind me what that email was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| I've gotten, I think, several emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Was it on the 10% deviation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| So the statute, what you'll have to do here, it's a 10% overall deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| So you can have a district that is at 8% and one at a negative 2%, that would give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| an overall 10% deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| So you do have a little bit of a leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| The goal, I mean, you could think of it as almost having every district under a plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| or minus 5%, that would get you that overall deviation of 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| And the concept of district plan versus the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| In regards to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| There was a question if it applied to just the district or if the district plan encompassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| all the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Yeah, it's going to be, I'm sorry, it's going to be the district plan, so it would encompass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| all the districts to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| So again, overall, 10% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Do any of my fellow commissioners have any questions about timeline, timeframe, questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| of the comptroller in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| If a plan is approved by Knox County, let's theoretically say on November 1st, when does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| it actually go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| And what is the timeframe if it is approved by Knox County on November 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| How long does it take the comptroller's office to give final approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| I mean, it would go into effect right as soon as the next election takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| You guys have a primary in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Chris can correct me if I'm wrong, but December 20th is the petition pick-up date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| So it'd be ideal to have your plan passed before December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| As far as us approving it, you would be looking at a, the hold-up would be for the Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| Commission to set their voting precincts, and then we would wait for to see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| legislature would do as far as if they end up splitting any voting precincts, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| they did, we would work with the Election Commission to get those corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| At that time, once the County Commission district lines are set and the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| lines are set, then we would send you what we call that certified map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| From a timeline perspective, I would be thinking that would probably come in January, January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Okay, and then how many County Commissions in Tennessee have already completed the redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| So that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| We are starting to get them flowing in this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| I believe we've got five or six already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| I know I've got McMinn, Sequatchie that has come in, Coffey County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| They are starting to flow in almost on a daily basis, and a lot of the counties have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| already, they were meeting weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| They've been going since the first of September or the end of August, so they've had a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| little jump on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| I was going to say, did you want to offer us any things that you've experienced where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| people did things correctly or incorrectly, or is there some guidance that you wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| The thing I would say is concentrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| This go around because of the delay due to COVID and getting the census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| That has put everybody behind on the timeline, but I would encourage you to get your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| done as soon as possible, and to do it right, do it equitable, and make sure that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| citizen of Knox County is represented properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| There has been some talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| There's a lot of talk in a lot of the counties about reducing commissioners and increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| We've seen a lot that are starting to go to that reduction of county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| That seems to be a discussion that is happening quite a bit now around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| There was a question about that as it pertains to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| In the literature you sent out, it said metropolitan areas under a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| We here in Knox County have a charter also that defines our number of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| What is the comptroller's opinion on, can we change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| We would have to dig a little bit deeper into actually what the charter says, but I'm guessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=429)|

| 0:07:20| We would have to take a deeper dive into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=443)|

| 0:07:41| Next item on our agenda is discussion of redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=461)|
| 0:07:55| Ms. Planning, do you want to go through these four proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| You should all have four printed out proposal maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| It's been a while since we looked over our website, so I wanted to go ahead and remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| everyone where to find the proposal maps on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| You go to our main page, knoxcountydistricts.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| You scroll down to the bottom, past meeting schedule, past current conditions, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| get to proposed solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| We have them in order of submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| The first one is the one that Commissioner Hill submitted before the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| If you click on the map button, it'll take you to a page where you can actually access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| This landing page doesn't have the legend showing immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| It's up in the top left corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| You can click on it and the legend will appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Alternatively, you can open up this bar at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| And over here on the bottom right corner, there's a big blue button that says show data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| That's the most important button on the screen, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Now you see all the districts by their district totals, the deviation, the racial composition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| the ethnic composition, the population moved per district, and the compactness of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| The top of this bar that comes up, you can switch over to a different proposed solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| It'll take a second to load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Can we get it on this screen here by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| IT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=576)|

| 0:10:21| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| You got to move it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=622)|
| 0:10:51| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Sorry for the interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Is there anything I should backtrack on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| Everybody keep up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| We have our district totals visible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| We can switch between different plans at the top in this blue panel up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| And you click, and then you can go back to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| You can also close this entirely and just look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| If you click on a precinct, you'll get the precinct population as well as the racial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| ethnic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| You can also type in your address here if you want to see close up to where you live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| or where someone else lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| And you can also, in this bottom right, you can export to CSV this whole table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| You can print it, format it, do whatever you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| So if we're all up to date on the website, I can show you number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=715)|
| 0:12:06| Submission one was submitted by Terry Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| This was viewed at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| There's an overall deviation of 7.9%, and the total population moved was 20,664.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=733)|
| 0:12:27| Would you like me to go into more detail on this plan or just keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| I had a question about compact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| How is that calculated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| The compactness is a measure that shows how sort of like a circle a shape is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| A circle is the most compact shape, and as things get more branched and more stretched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| out, they become less like a circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| We compare it to a more round, compact shape, and we say that shapes that are branching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| out, that are stretched, that aren't really focused on one compact shape, they're a lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| compactness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| We're reporting it on a scale of 0 to 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| So intuitively, we all kind of know that District 1 is the least compact, and we can see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| that it has the lowest compactness on this list, with 60.01%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| If you'd like to know more about the methodology, I can pull that up, but it does get a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| No, I'll come see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| It appears that school board member from the 8th District is outside this district in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=820)|
| 0:13:50| this diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=830)|
| 0:14:03| Under what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Are you looking at a different map, or which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| On the first one, in the hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| The school board member Mike McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I have it pulled up, and it looks like he's still within District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Which precinct do you have him registered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| The property actually on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| So, we didn't put the addresses directly on people's houses, just to give them a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| bit of privacy on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| It would say that it's in the middle of a road, but it just means somewhere in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I don't believe I proposed any changes in District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| Is that the one we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=887)|
| 0:14:56| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Going on to the second proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=907)|
| 0:15:17| It looks like Proposal No. 2 would be on the boundary line of Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| Chairman, if that's what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| No. 87, which is the Thorn Grove area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| You know, there's just no, it was no specificity to be able to tell where that is exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| I looked up the address on KGIS, and it gave the precinct for which he was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=935)|
| 0:15:47| I believe...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=947)|
| 0:15:57| It showed he was in Precinct 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=957)|
| 0:16:07| 78 would still be under, if you're looking at Scenario 2, 78 would still be within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| 8 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Aubrey, please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Sorry, I couldn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| Proposed Solution 2 was committed by Commissioner Larson Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| It had an overall deviation of 9.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| It moved at the total population of 33,438 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| I have a question on this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Why would you move a number of, like in District 7, we have a school board member that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1013)|
| 0:17:03| sees over high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Why would you move them out and put them in another district closer to Carnes when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| closer to their schools that they represent, like Powell and Halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| That would displace a lot of people who could not vote for their school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1034)|
| 0:17:23| Why was that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Which school board representative are you discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1046)|

| 0:17:35| High school is in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| And then you move the other little green part down there, you moved it over toward the Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| so you're displacing a lot of people who could not vote for the school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| Where are you saying Ms. Bounds lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| No, I'm confused with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Ms. Bounds lives in 7 and she would stay in 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| She would stay in 7, but what I'm saying is, is if you move that high school to someplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| else, it makes it a bigger territory in District 8, but she would not represent as a consolidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1088)|
| 0:18:17| Which district are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| No, no, I'm sorry, which precinct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| 56, 58N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| So 58N and 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| So we have confusion, you'd have people in District 8 voting in District 7, or District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| 7 in District 8, and then where it is right now, everybody knows where they're voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| at for their school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Well, I think that's the nature of redistricting, you're going to have to move some people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| some new parts of the county, and they're going to have to change, so this was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| based on doing math and trying to figure out how to fit a scenario in which it didn't move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| any of the representatives, but it helped make the math work in a way that would shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| but I mean, the whole county is going to have to shift some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| We're going to have to, some people are going to have to vote in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Oh, I understand that, but the little piece that you put out here in the top that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| over in District 6 is kind of like a little shoot-off of something else, and one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| before in District 7, they were, it looked like a half-moon district in there, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| finally got it consolidated where it was more easily for people to understand where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| lived at and who they voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Yeah, the district, or Precinct 63 and had almost 5,000 people, whereas the other two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| districts had about 4,000 people, so it was about when the districts from the, when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| precincts, precinct number 87, Thorn Grove, was proposed to put into District 9, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1195)|
| 0:20:07| just about moving the math over and trying to find more population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1207)|
| 0:20:26| Any more questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| I'll break you guys to the next one, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| Solution 3 was proposed by Commissioner John Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| Now I'll ask my question about Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| It does appear, if you go to KGIS, has anybody done that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| It does say that he is in Precinct 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1256)|
| 0:21:05| And we pulled up Precinct 76 for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Great Mill Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Yes, he has the Great Mill Road address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Is this the wrong address that's on this map then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I don't think it is at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Mr. Chairman, there's a couple mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| For instance, District 4, they've identified the home in the wrong location because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| a previous address, so some of these are not exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Chairman, also, just pulling up Election Commission's website, his latest financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| disclosure, his address listed is Great Mill Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I just wanted to make sure we weren't pushing somebody outside the district that they currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| We'll double check all those addresses before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| So that leads me to a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| What happens if that does actually happen, if someone is redistricted out of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| in which they are sitting on a term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| Are they allowed to serve their full term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| That's an excellent question of which I do not have the immediate answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I do know that that happened 10 years ago in redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| That you may tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| An affected person was allowed to finish their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| Chris, what's the election cycle on the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Are they the same with the County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| He'll be up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| In theory, he could pick up a position December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| The general law is that you serve until your elected term is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| I mean, that's the general rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| There are some that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| He's not on the ballot until what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| He's not on the ballot until what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| He would continue to serve out what he was elected to, and then when the new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| comes in, he would run in that new district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| If he is put in another district, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| He would be allowed to finish out his term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| Please continue, Aubrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Solution 3 had an overall deviation of 8.7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and the total population moved was 35,252 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| Are there any questions about Proposal 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Can I make a comment on Number 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| One of the things, too, that if you'll notice on the total population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| the two districts that have a projected annual growth rate of more than 1%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| which is only two districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| what we did was reduce the number in that district to around the 51,000 range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| because we know within two to five years, it's going to be well above the 53,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| which is the norm then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| So, I think that's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Commissioner, I like how you moved 70E as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| I think that makes a lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| especially given the Chaud Road right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| not letting that be a natural boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| and you moved the 70E in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| But I do have a question for Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| If we decided to split a precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| we can't do that during a district concession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| we can't split a precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| you can't split a precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| you can't split a census block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| That's really the only rules that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Of course, the other issue right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| the majority of our precincts we can't split right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| because we have a city election going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| And probably at least half, I'm guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| of the current county precincts have city voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| So, we can't split a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| And probably at least half, I'm guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| of the current county precincts have city voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| So, I couldn't even risk splitting them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1505)|
| 0:25:14| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| The change of the 70E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| while I concur on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| while I concur on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| I guess it would be the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I guess it would be the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| that would seem like a very natural boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=1533)|

| 0:42:54| my assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2579)|

| 0:43:06| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Unless I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| incorrect on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| sends to county commission, county commission could still make modifications to it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| it's actually codified as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| That's correct, and there will also be public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| So I mean, I guess ultimately the chair of this committee could direct the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2606)|
| 0:43:36| on how many proposals we want to send to county commission, but I was sort of assuming we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| would whittle it down to one, and that is generally done by a voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| If that's the will of this body, then that's how we'll do it, if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2628)|
| 0:44:09| If I may, Commissioner Smith, so Commissioner Buehler, am I hearing you say that when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2649)|
| 0:44:18| meet next week then that we should be, if possible, coming to an agreement at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2658)|
| 0:44:29| in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I'm just wanting clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| If I understood Chairman Smith correctly, it would be at the October 6th meeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| we would like to have a consensus from this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| I don't believe we have a meeting scheduled next week, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| I believe October 6th is the next meeting, and am I correct about that, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| You are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| And one of the reasons why I made that noon on Monday deadline so commissioners would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| have time to be able to look at if there's any new proposals and review these as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| before October 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| I just want to make sure we don't spend too much time in committee getting to too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2710)|
| 0:45:20| of a point and then turning it over to commission and the whole thing opens back up again, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| we are crunched for time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| But if it's the will of this body that we spend five, ten hours, whatever it takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| on October 6th to whittle this down to one plan to recommend to commission, I'm good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Because hopefully I won't be sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Let's say we have four proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| We may have two or three more to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| I think at some point, it's not going to be unanimous consent and people are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| to vote yes or no and you're going to have to whittle it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I think you go through and pick certain proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| We can probably take out, let's say we have seven, we could probably go through on a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| round vote and do like we do nominations and sort of drop the bottom three and then whittle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| it down and drop the bottom two and then negotiate the last couple of two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| But I think it's better to have this body vote and take votes that go forward, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| some experiences in the last year where it was hard pressed by commissioners to say vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| take a vote here in committee before it goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Otherwise, it's just a suggestion and then we got to hash it out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| So I would encourage us to whittle it down and then send it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2806)|
| 0:46:56| I tend to agree with Commissioner Jack and I don't know that it's going to take us ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| hours to be real honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| All of us are going to lose precincts and all of us are going to pick up precincts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| There's not going to be unanimous consent, but I mean, if we're trying to make everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| leave the table happy, we'll be here a hundred hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| But ultimately, we just have to vote and that's how it's going to go at commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2836)|
| 0:47:26| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| Any further discussion of any of these four plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2853)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| We'll move to the next item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Can I jump in real quick and just ask a question, I guess, about planning with the changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker's plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Will those be reflected on the website at some point relatively soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Our goal will still be to try to get it up within one business day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| It might be labeled, you know, 3A, but it will be up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| And the same holds true for any other submissions that are made before the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| Yes, we will get them up as soon as possible and notify the committee when they are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| If we're setting a deadline on Monday at 12, are we also using that deadline as a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2904)|
| 0:48:32| withdrawal of plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Perhaps if I look at, say, I put in one of these four or there's one of seven and I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| you know, I really think this one accomplishes many of the same thing, there's no sense in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| keeping mine on the table because this is a better idea that also that deadline is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| pull it off so we don't have one extra one laying out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Is that, would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Would that be okay as well to sort of, you're in or you're out at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| I guess I could do that at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| You could, I mean, you could rescind your plan at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I'll look through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I might just ask just from the plans we've seen, is there anything in these for any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2954)|
| 0:49:28| us that's a total deal breaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| Just a total deal breaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I mean, it's like if I lose this precinct or I don't lose this precinct, is anybody saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| well, then I can't support it no matter what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Have you had a chance to look hard enough yet to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| I think it's kind of hard to make that decision because we don't know what all plans are yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| at this point, just the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| I heard Charlie speak up and say, well, we've got this section, was it Haskell you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| talking about and Copper Ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I mean, is that a deal breaker for you, Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| It is for the community because Haskell and Copper Ridge came together and had a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3013)|
| 0:50:21| center and they built it and then they went on into Powell and have a building there which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| serves the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| And when you start breaking it up, then they start going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| That's the kind of thing that would be good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| But it is a community and that's what you want to do is hold communities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| You don't want to split it up in the way you do the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| Commissioner Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Chris, if we move 24Q, that means Virginia would not have a school, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| We can have a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| So 24Q should not be moved out of the 4th District because Virginia would lose a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3054)|
| 0:51:04| school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Very possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I mean, that's something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| You just talked about Mike McMillan just a minute ago, getting him out of, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| That wasn't me, but I'm just saying I don't think you could, you know, unfortunately my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| position is had the federal government gotten us the data when they promised us that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| would, we wouldn't be in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We would have been able to change some precincts, line them up, and this would have been a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| easier process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| But these are the cards we're dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| And now we can't just say, OK, we're going to throw X plan out because a certain school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| board member doesn't get a high school, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, or why don't we say, well, if you don't get six middle schools or six elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| schools, then let's throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| I mean, unfortunately, this is the cards that we've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| And it's not going to be 100 percent, but we've got to get close to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| So, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| I was just going to say, and I do think there is a difference between perhaps distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| of the high schools as opposed to zoning a elected board member out if we can help it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| which I think is what we were talking about in District 8, wasn't it, initially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| I just would again ask Knox Planning to make sure that our current incumbents, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3148)|
| 0:52:38| have their addresses correctly because I wouldn't feel good about doing that to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3158)|
| 0:52:48| Yes, we'll contact the school board tomorrow and make sure that we get correct addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| Yeah, Commissioner Wards, but I think he moved more into the middle of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| Yeah, he's in the middle of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Yeah, that's his old Tierra Verde address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| If not, we're going to move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| First up is Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| Sam, did you go through this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| Sam who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| He knows I got to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Yeah, who's that guy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| Sam McKenzie, State Representative, 411 Carter Road, Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| I did go through this process 10 years ago, and it's part of the reason I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Great conversation tonight, but I think that there's a theme in what you all are hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| is, above all, it's about the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| It's about who you all are representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| As Commissioner Daley talked about, and it is important, in my humble opinion, to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| a high school that means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| It means something to that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| With that said, 10 years ago, we were focused on getting the school boards and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| commissions together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| That was our focus, because people didn't know who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| There was an issue, a pothole at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3279)|

| 0:58:55| You would state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3537)|

| 0:59:03| So, I mean, you guys are in a tough situation, and I just wanted to bring a couple of points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| to this redistricting meeting that you guys may not have thought about yet, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| really want to make you aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| So I've lived in Knoxville for 20 years, and I'm an East Knoxville resident, district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| one resident for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| And as Mayor McKenzie, he just said it, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3573)|
| 0:59:43| that was phenomenal in that it said that we have minority representation across the border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| in how we look at districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Because of that bill, we've elected more than 9,000 African Americans to office, over 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3594)|
| 1:00:03| Latinos to office, many other Native Americans and other races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| So it's important that we look at keeping the integrity of that bill around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| And in Knoxville particular, we have had four districts that were carved out that have stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3616)|
| 1:00:26| majority minority because of the Voting Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| And that's district one, city council, county commission, that's the school board district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| one, city council district six, and state district 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| Now today, I'd like to just speak against any efforts, whether intentional or unintentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| because there's a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| So these things are unintentional that would dilute the minority electorate's influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| While it's true that the district county commission, our district one county commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| slightly underpopulated, there are ways for district one to grow without pushing the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| diverse precincts into that precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Commissioner Jay's map that was submitted dilutes the Knoxville collective voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| The proposal removes precinct 31 in the far eastern part of the district, which has over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| 22% Black population and replaces it with two districts, precinct 11, which has only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| 6% Black, and precinct 24, which has 1% Black population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3696)|
| 1:01:44| This would drastically change the makeup of district one, potentially creating a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| to the Voter Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Diluting Knox County's one majority district, which with another district composed of 97%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3713)|
| 1:02:02| white West Knoxville voters, would throw off the political power that we see right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| There's much easier ways to, and more creative ways, I think, that you guys could come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| with to fix the proposal for district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| For example, precinct 14 nor will it be moved into district one instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| Furthermore, there are no reasons to move 24Q out of district four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| The makeup of district four fits well with 24Q socially, racially, geographically, economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3748)|
| 1:02:37| and there are much better options to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| I applaud Ms. Christie's map in finding a better way to grow the district's population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| While I do not believe it's perfect, I hope that other maps will be submitted as you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I think that she's done the best job in finding creative solutions to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| Again, I urge you all to continue the difficult work, as tough as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| I'd like to give you the emphasis on maintaining the minority elective's influence and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3785)|

| 1:03:33| Sometimes it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| The process is hard because you're moving population and we have to send it to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| and then we don't get to see all of the data of how everybody's moved until it comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| and it comes out and it becomes a real proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Actually, I believe that there's better proposals, including Ms. Christie's, already proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210923-redistricting?start=3826)|
