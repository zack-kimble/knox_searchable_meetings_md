| 0:01:15| All present, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Okay, thank you so much, everyone, for attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| Today's topic of our workshop is going to be the Community Improvement Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| which are better known as the 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| Savannah is going to walk us through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| and talk about the importance of getting timely responses back from us as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| relates to whether or not we want to support financially a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| organization that's requested 202 funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| or whether we don't want you to choose not to give funding to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| So, Savannah, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Feel free, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| whichever whatever council prefers to interrupt as we go along or wait till| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| the end for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| I'm going to try to zip through it as quick as I can so that we have plenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| of time for questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| I hope you all had the opportunity to review the packet that was sent out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| I will be using it. I will reference it throughout the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=131)|
| 0:02:18| So for starters, just to give you some information about the what is referred to as a 202 fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| It became effective in Knoxville in 1989, July 1st, 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| And at that time, for accounting purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| they assigned a number so that they could account for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| And it was fund number 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| So that's why we call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| But, of course, the proper term for it is the community improvement fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| The fund itself, of course, is regulated by several different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| And this is how I make the procedures that I use to process them to send you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| requests to get documentations from organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| And we'll go over those if you can put to it should be page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=185)|
| 0:03:13| But I think because the agenda was added to the packet, it might be page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| And you're your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| This is the section of the Tennessee code annotated that regulates what the fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| itself can be used for and what documents we have to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=208)|
| 0:03:36| My understanding is that this has been in place since 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| It has been amended multiple times, most recently in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| So what DCA 654 111 does is it allows legislative bodies of municipalities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| appropriate funds for financial aid of nonprofit charitable or civic organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| So those are 501 C threes, 501 C fours and 501 C sixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=242)|
| 0:04:12| Of course, if it is a C4 or C6, we just have to notice that in a newspaper before it's approved before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=252)|
| 0:04:21| We don't have that requirement with the 501 C threes. And that's mostly what we get requests for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=261)|
| 0:04:30| The TCA also explains that the comptroller of the treasury shall devise certain procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=270)|
| 0:04:42| It is page seven, I believe, in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| And this is the procedures that are provided by the state comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| They're really not any different than what's provided in TCA with the exception of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| An option for the annual report, which we will get to when we cover documents later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| TCA also states that each legislative body will devise their own guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| And so the city of Knoxville has done that. And those are also in your packet on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| That's city code section two dash five, nine, six or two dash six or three, which we will go over as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=324)|
| 0:05:36| The one thing that I want to make sure I point out in TCA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| At the bottom of page four, where it says that any nonprofit organization that desires financial assistance from its municipality shall file with the city clerk, which we we keep in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=344)|
| 0:05:58| A copy of an annual report of its business affairs and transactions that include but is not limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| And then it says a completed annual audit, a description of the program that serves the residents of the municipality and the proposed use of municipal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=365)|
| 0:06:17| Municipal assistance. So the annual audit is one of the documentation items that I tend to have the most difficulty in getting the proper documentation for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=377)|
| 0:06:30| So I just wanted to make it clear that that is in here and that's why I ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| And that's why we're so adamant about getting the proper documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| I'm moving on. We're going to go to the city code, which was on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| Or none. The first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=407)|
| 0:06:57| First thing I want to point out is the eligibility for funds is made clear in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=417)|
| 0:07:10| No appropriation or expenditure may be made under this division to any organization unless it is a nonprofit nonprofit charitable general welfare of the residents of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=430)|
| 0:07:23| No appropriations or expenditures may be made to a religious or sectarian organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| So we occasionally will get requests from churches or other overtly obvious religious organizations, in which case I will send them a letter explaining that they are not eligible for these funds for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=451)|
| 0:07:51| And I have included a copy of that letter on page 10 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| Just so you know, you know, we explain that it's this section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| We say what the code says and then explain that they have any more questions that they can contact me and my office member and email is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=482)|
| 0:08:16| After that in the code, it says application for funds, and this is a little bit more detailed than what the TCA has set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=496)|
| 0:08:31| Not much, but a little bit. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| Trying to think of the best way to go through this or not flipping back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| Things that the application must include when they apply for funds is a copy of the corporate charter or other articles, a constitution, bylaw or instrument of organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=524)|
| 0:08:56| That's just one of those. We have to have a copy from the IRS stating that they are indeed nonprofit so that it says they're of a 1C3, C4 or C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=536)|
| 0:09:07| We have to have a statement to the nature and extent of the program of the organization in which they serve the residents of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| Typically, this comes in the form of a letter on letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| We have to have the proposed use of municipal funding and assistance. Again, this normally comes in the letter. Occasionally, it comes more in the form of a proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=559)|
| 0:09:29| I'll accept either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| A copy of the audit for the most recent fiscal year. The proposed budget for the organization and any other information that may be required by counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=573)|
| 0:09:46| So that last one I leave up to counsel. I don't request anything additional unless a council member contacts me specifically and and requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=586)|
| 0:09:56| Can you follow up with this organization and get something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| So just to go through some of the documents, page 16 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=599)|
| 0:10:15| Now, I'm sorry, page 11 of your packet. This is an example of the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| So it just says, you know, why the organization exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| Typically, it goes over the board of directors or officers and what their duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| I do not read it as long as it is a formal bylaws that is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=635)|
| 0:10:48| I accept it. After that, on page 16 is an example of a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| So this is from an older organization as we get them from organizations that were started last year and some that were started a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=657)|
| 0:11:07| And and this was from the 70s. So this is a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| Again, it goes over why what the mission statement is, why it exists, who the officers and things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| So it's it's been filed and signed. And that's really all I look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=680)|
| 0:11:29| Page 22 is an example of the articles of incorporation. Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| Just a different name. Page 25 is another example of a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=695)|
| 0:11:49| And then on page 28, this is an example of an acceptable text designation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| So occasionally what I run into is organizations only provide me a sales tax document that says that they don't have to pay sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=717)|
| 0:12:08| but it doesn't say what their designation is. And so this is really what I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| This is specifically the letter that I need from the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| It has their EIN on it or their their TIN. And it says that they are a 501 C three, four or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=737)|
| 0:12:26| I do keep all of this documentation on file. So typically for an organization with the bylaws and the charter and this tax designation letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| once they've submitted it the first time, that's it. They only have to resubmit it if it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| Now, I do put on the Web site to provide all the documents every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| because we will have organizations that have requested funds 20 years ago and the file may not contain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=770)|
| 0:12:59| So I want to make sure we have an up to date file before we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| The next page, page 29, is a good example of a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| I get them in all forms. Some of them are two pages long. Some of them are two sentences long and they're all acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| I do like to have it on letterhead. It seems more official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| But the important part is that it says why they're using the funds and how much they want or how much they're requesting to do whatever project they're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=801)|
| 0:13:37| So move on to page 31. This is an example of what I get sometimes when people hear the term annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=817)|
| 0:13:52| Of course, in the TCA, an annual report means an audited report and audited financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=832)|
| 0:14:01| This is a good example of something that could be used as a statement of how the organization serves the citizens of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=841)|
| 0:14:10| But this cannot be used as an annual report because it does not show audited financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=850)|
| 0:14:19| If you'll skip to page 43, this is a good example of audited financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| And I try. I know TCA says annual report. I try to always say audited financials because I think it's more clear and kind of expresses what the code is really looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=865)|
| 0:14:41| So this is a good example of that. Page 59 is a good example of a proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=881)|
| 0:14:53| It is not a good example of audited financials. So sometimes I will get organizations that submit this to me for their audited financials or for their annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=893)|
| 0:15:05| And I have to explain to them, this really isn't what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| We need something different and we'll go over what other options they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| But because they already have this and I already have it at that point, I will accept it as a proposed budget because it has everything there for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=915)|
| 0:15:26| And there's no reason for them to have to do more paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=926)|
| 0:15:38| Page 63 is another good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| So for those organizations that provide that that may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| They either they don't meet the threshold to where they're required to do audit and audit each year or they just don't have an audit done each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=951)|
| 0:16:01| I will accept a form to have an option. They have an option called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=961)|
| 0:16:11| An e-postcard, which is really just a nine ninety electronically, and the organization logs into the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| They explain that they are under the fifty thousand dollar threshold and submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| And that's it. So we accept that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| So page sixty four is an example of the full form nine ninety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=990)|
| 0:16:41| Page eighty one is an example of the e-postcard, the electronic notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| And I think this is one. I'm not sure if they can do this format anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| I wanted to include it in case they can. And page eighty two is what I see more often now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| And I think that's because they've moved most the IRS have moved mostly to electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| When. Oh, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1026)|
| 0:17:23| Well, OK, here it is, because I was doing my space bar, but it wouldn't let me do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| My question for you when you talked about audited financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| And then we talked about doing something for organizations filing a tax return if they don't have receipts of over fifty thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| So there's a big gap because Tennessee state law doesn't require you to do an audit for a nonprofit unless you have over half a million dollars in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1064)|
| 0:17:56| At, you know, and I'm not suggesting we change this, I'm just saying that's a real hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| And it impacts a lot of small nonprofits that may be a 501 C three, all that kind of stuff, but they don't pay the expense of an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| Is that if I understood correctly, is that something that this council could change our requirements or that or is that tied to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1091)|
| 0:18:26| And we cannot change that. OK, is a state requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| OK, I just think we need to be clear about that because people will think that's something that we can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| But that's a legislative state legislative issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Correct. And it does say in the Tennessee code annotated and the state comptroller's procedures both suggest that we acquire that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| So in an attempt to try and allow those smaller organizations to still be able to qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1129)|
| 0:18:58| That's why I will accept the 990 postcard. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| OK, so we will use that as a substitution for the audit sort of their their tax return, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| They're not their tax return. OK. Yeah. Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| So 82 page 82 is an example of that, that they do electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| Page 83. I wanted to put this one in here because I had an organization that was having some difficulty, I guess, understanding the documents that we needed and how to to get them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1166)|
| 0:19:42| So they actually had logged on to the IRS website and created their organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| But they hadn't actually submitted a 990. And this is an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| So I could not accept this. However, I was able to work with that organization and we did get their 990 postcard filed and they printed it and returned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1194)|
| 0:20:05| So we were able to move forward. And I do want to say to, you know, if someone's having a hard time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1205)|
| 0:20:15| I spent quite a bit of time on the phone with them and, of course, offer to let them come to my office so that we can get things worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1215)|
| 0:20:25| because I know that these these documents are confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| I've even sent copies of acceptable documents to organizations to show them this is what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| Do you have something that looks more like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| And so sometimes that's helpful and sometimes it's just not because they they they don't qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| They don't have the documents to qualify. Page 84 is another example of what some people provide to me as an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1247)|
| 0:21:00| This is where they've I think they log into an electronic system with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| This is not audited financials. This is not what we need. So I just have to follow up with them and let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1267)|
| 0:21:16| Page 85 and 86, I do not have a ton of experience with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1276)|
| 0:21:25| Because I think organizations are able to meet this requirement in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| So this is a document that the comptroller has put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| An organized an organization can fill this out and have it certified by their CFO and present it in place of audited financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1300)|
| 0:21:54| In my experience, if an organization has a CFO, they have audited financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| And so I don't have a lot of experience with it, but it is another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| Page 87 is another example of a proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| So the the code nor the state code or the city code is really specific about what a proposed budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| It just says that a proposed budget. So sometimes we get them for a year from organizations because they already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| It already exists. So they send it to us. And sometimes we will get something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| which is just specific to the event that they're requesting funds for. I will accept either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| Page 88 is a is an example of the signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| W-9 is signed, completed. So as we filled in, I have that number in there and it has to be signed and dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| And we needed this so that we can set them up in our system as a vendor so that we can pay them once once funds are appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1373)|
| 0:23:04| So that goes over kind of documents before we move on to the next sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Are there any other questions? I can't see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| So hopefully we'll let me help me look for people. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| So moving on, based on all that information, I have put together the checklist and I like to call it a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1404)|
| 0:23:33| I don't want to call it an application because I don't actually approve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Council does that. So I refer to it as a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| And that just means that these are all the documents we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| And you can see that on page 89. So we get, of course, contact information up front of who I need to talk to phone numbers, email addresses, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1426)|
| 0:23:58| If they do not specify in their letter the amount that they're requesting, they can put it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| So I'll reference that as well. We.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Did make it clear on the checklist that no appropriations can be made to religious or sectarian organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| And then we asked them to certify that knowing that information, they are still eligible to receive funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| And then we have a list of the documents and my contact information so they can get in touch with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| And we did recently remove the fax number from the checklist, but we do still have a fax number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| So, I mean, they can drop the application off at the office. They can mail it, you know, postal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| They can fax it. They can email it. There's a number of ways that they can get it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| And then this part down at the bottom is for my use only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| And that's where I record when I send the request out to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| And as you communicate back to me, you know, yes, this amount of money or no, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Then I record that there. So when I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1506)|
| 0:25:15| When I'm contacted by an organization, what I do is I will reference them to the checklist, which is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| If they come in, I have printed copies or I can email that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| I can email them a PDF or a link if they have Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| Once they return the checklist, a completed checklist with all of the items, then I send the email to counsel that says this organization has requested funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1535)|
| 0:25:46| Now, based on what previous counsel has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| Expected, I guess, anticipated, I only provide the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| I only forward the letter to you all and then we can discuss that later in the in the meeting or at a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1558)|
| 0:26:06| If counsel is interested in receiving all of this other information, too, so that you can make a decision on, you know, are they financially stable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| Do I want to appropriate funds or whatever reasons you may have to appropriate funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| But as of right now, I will forward the letter in an email and say they're requesting funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| So once I have received notification from all council members back either, yes, with this amount or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1587)|
| 0:26:36| or can you ask them this question or can you get this information from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Then I'll do that. Once everyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Said said their wishes. I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| Write the ordinance and submit it to the law department to be added to counsel's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| Once on the agenda, of course, it comes before you all and at a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1622)|
| 0:27:13| For your approval, I'm sorry, before we move on to that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| So once I once I get everyone, everyone has said this is how much I want to appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| I will send out an email that says, OK, their request has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Or if not, everyone has responded yet, but their request has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| I will send that out and I'll just mark everybody else down his nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Now, at that point, if someone says, oh, but I really wanted to appropriate to this and they contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| If a council member contacts me, I work at the will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| So if they want me to proceed at that point, then I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| We have to contact the organization. We have to get additional documentation, but I will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1672)|
| 0:28:04| So then it will come before council on council's agenda once it is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| And after the minutes have been completed, because I use the minutes as supporting documentation to send to the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| I will take the minutes, I will take the AIS from the agenda and I will do a check request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1698)|
| 0:28:28| Will and I sign this documentation and send it to finance to be kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| And then I update and maintain the spreadsheet that you all see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| And we have a copy at the end of our packet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| So that everything's up to date and all balances are up to date. And then about a week after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| I'll go back into the system and double check to make sure your balances on the spreadsheet match the balances, according to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| So that's that's the procedure that I do. Are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1739)|
| 0:29:07| Savannah, I have a question, please. So I know a lot of times these nonprofits, when they're requesting funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| it could be to support some type of outreach or event that they're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| So there there's some timelines that are associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| What is the time frame for your process? If you will kind of put that into perspective for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| Sure. So I have several examples. Do you want me to go over those now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Sure. That'd be great. OK. OK. So these are examples of some timelines and some issues that have come up because of those timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1776)|
| 0:29:50| There was a homeowners association that requested funds. I got a partial request from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| so I couldn't get all of the required documentation. But we started the process on October 3rd, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1797)|
| 0:30:06| We finally got all of the documentation we needed and the payment request was sent to finance December 17th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| So this took over a year. Now, of course, in that situation, it was the organization and we were trying to get documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1815)|
| 0:30:25| But, you know, I mean, that it can take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| And that's why I wait until I have all the documents before I send them to council, because if it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| On June 30th at the end of the fiscal year and a member of council has appropriated five hundred dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| but we don't have all the documentation, we we can't process that. And so then they would just lose that five hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| So that's why I try to wait to make sure we're ready to process before appropriations are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| There was a another nonprofit that was having a festival that requested funds on June 30th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1860)|
| 0:31:17| I had they they provided all the documentation and I communicated that to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| That same day, June 30th, and then a second time on August 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| But due to a lack of or a delay in responses, we were not able to cut that check until February 25th, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1888)|
| 0:31:40| Now, this may have been an issue because their event was in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| Now, it worked out that they were able to still use those funds to cover costs that they had had with that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| But if they had already paid off all of their expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| we would have had to have done an ordinance to repeal and had them send the check back and done more paperwork to get them another request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| And it could have been a huge ordeal in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| It was not. There was another organization that we received a request from January 28th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1933)|
| 0:32:26| The request. This is an example of where the request was fulfilled. So I sent that notification to council March 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| However, after that, there were council members that responded wanting to to still appropriate funds above and beyond what their request was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1953)|
| 0:32:45| So there was a delay because I had to contact the organization again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| The organization has to resubmit their documents because we basically use the amount that they request as an invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| So we can't pay any more than what they request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| So I had to do the additional documentation and we were able to get it processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| I think they're currently still waiting on their check. But as of last week, it was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| So. So that was from January, the end of January to the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| Savannah. Yes. Quick question. Is it possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| And I think it would be helpful to me when you make when you put out ask to us that there's a deadline that we have to reply to you by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| OK, that's because sometimes I don't reply because I'm holding out because I'm expecting other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| And then if those things don't pan out, I'm willing to give to a particular organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| But I tend to hold back thinking that I'm going to get an ask or a pending ask from someone else that I had funding in mind for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2024)|
| 0:33:54| So if I'm sure I think if, you know, obviously some of us isn't giving these asks for longer than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| In my experience, sometimes the ask comes to us multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And I think if there's a finite like you got to tell me, you know, in 14 days or whatever, three weeks, this is your deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2047)|
| 0:34:17| This is your date. You got to tell me. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| So there are there are some other suggestions that I had as well as ways that we can kind of move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2061)|
| 0:34:31| Ultimately, it's council as well. So whatever council wants me to do, that's definitely what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| And that that is definitely an option. Councilman Puget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you. I guess for me, I'm new to this, but I have no idea how many requests we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| I mean, I think every other granting agency, everybody else that does grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| There's a deadline and they accept grants maybe three or four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| They all come in and then you can weigh them. I think what's hard for me about this is I have no idea what's coming next, if and when they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2103)|
| 0:35:13| And so I could wind up with some leftover because there's some stuff I would have funded sooner had I known that that was all it was going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2113)|
| 0:35:22| So this have a finite amount of money to use in a 12 month period and requests coming in every month is a little confusing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2122)|
| 0:35:32| That's just me. But it would help me if we told the community we accept grant applications four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| I don't know. That's just Lynn. I'll roll with the flow and I'll figure this out if we're not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| But a struggle for me personally. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| I mean, I would definitely I think at the end of this, I had left an opportunity for us to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| I think it would definitely be helpful for me to have some some clear guidelines from council as to what what is expected on things like that on a deadline and how to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2160)|
| 0:36:14| Absolutely. Another organization and this is this is not a reoccurring problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2174)|
| 0:36:24| However, I did want to let you all know of it. So there was an organization that had requested funds in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| And this is an organization that always provides a completed checklist to me the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| And so I had sent the information out. It was completed and sent to finance in early February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| However, their event was in May of this year. So, of course, due to COVID-19 and all of the circumstances right now, they had to change their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2205)|
| 0:37:00| Now, the funds, the monies are supposed to be spent the way the ordinances says they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| And the ordinance had said that it was to be specifically used for this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| So you will be seeing this before you next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| In this circumstance, we're just going to do another ordinance explaining that that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2238)|
| 0:37:26| That I've communicated to the council members that appropriated and they were willing to still allow them to use the funds for their other event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| We just have to do an ordinance that says that that's OK. So that's an unusual circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2254)|
| 0:37:43| I'm hoping that we don't have any more of those. I've been trying to follow up with organizations before an item comes before council to ask if their event was still going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2263)|
| 0:37:54| But, of course, we don't know at this point. So. And then this last example is just an example of how quickly we can we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2274)|
| 0:38:06| So I received a completed request from the organization and communicated to the council member that appropriated the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2286)|
| 0:38:17| And we had it on council's agenda and approved and sent to finance to have the check cut by April 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| So it was just a little just two weeks. So, you know, if everything goes smoothly, we can get it done really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2305)|
| 0:38:35| We just all have to be on our toes. So those are some examples of things that happen that can delay or expedite the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2315)|
| 0:38:47| Does that answer questions that you had, Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| It did. And I think I don't know about anybody else, but I'm shocked that there are some examples where it's taken an organization close to a year or months or after there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2333)|
| 0:39:07| The need was requested for whatever they were going to use the funds for. I think that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| There are some organizations that are depending upon that funding to be successful in whatever that they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| So I would like to hear some suggestions, some additional suggestions and recommendations on how we can be more efficient as a council in getting these requests turned around more quickly than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2360)|
| 0:39:34| If we decide to continue on the path that we're on, I think Councilwoman Ryder's recommendation that in the subject line, when you send it out, you have what the deadline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2374)|
| 0:39:44| And I don't think it should be any more than 30 days for them to be able to get the funding that we approve to them expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2384)|
| 0:39:56| Unless you're a really large organization, some of them probably can't have the scope of whatever type of event they're trying to have without the funding they request from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2396)|
| 0:40:07| In addition to that, I think that Councilwoman Puget is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| We have a limited amount of money that we are afforded to distribute to organizations in our community and across the city that are doing good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2411)|
| 0:40:23| But when you're out, you're out. And sometimes, you know, you can say, man, these are some great causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| But I think this I've heard this other organization may be doing something later in the year, and I want to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| And so I think we need to consider what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| You know, do we want to look at trying to make it making a change that says that we have an open time frame that we accept 202 fund applications for the year, for that fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2440)|
| 0:40:53| And then we know how we are going to appropriate the $10,000 that we're allotted during that that calendar year, that budget year rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2453)|
| 0:41:03| So I'd like to open it up for discussion and conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2463)|
| 0:41:20| Just say, go ahead. I was just going to say in your packet, page 117 is an example of a previous it's a previous year spreadsheet for the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2480)|
| 0:41:33| And this is an example of the type of requests that we have received for a full year and what appropriations were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| I don't know if that helps in making any of those decisions, but I wanted to definitely make it available for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| We have several years in the office, but I can always make available to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| It was just easier to do just one in the packet, but it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Savannah, I know that we get a very wide range of requests from just a few dollars to all the way up to the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| Can we have a different process, more complicated process, more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| And if it's a small amount, maybe make it simpler. Maybe that would speed up things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| Again, you know, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but of course, it's council's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And so if that's the will of council, then that's what I'll do. However, I will caution you that we do still have to stay compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| So as long as it's within the state regulation and city code, then, you know, whatever council wishes is what I will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2552)|
| 0:42:44| And Councilwoman Affutu, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you, Vice Mayor. I wonder if there would be benefit and if we're going to try this out, taking applications twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2568)|
| 0:43:01| Because a lot of organizations don't know in July what they're going to want to do in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| But if we wanted to try twice a year, I don't think we can do it a whole year in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2588)|
| 0:43:18| I don't even mind four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| I just want some deadlines that I then know I have so that in my mind I can say I've got $100 a quarter or I've got $5,000 in my school brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2601)|
| 0:43:37| Or I can hold all mine because I might know there's something big coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I don't know. I just you pros that have been doing this for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Tell us how it works because that's that's been my, you know, George left me half of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| But I've had no idea what might be coming this next half of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| Councilwoman Parker and then we'll go to Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| I was just going to recommend some sort of hybrid system where the organizations can still apply year round, but we designate four of our council meetings per year to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2641)|
| 0:44:18| And, you know, we could even leave. This doesn't solve the problem of folks who who wait for a long time for a decision, but folks could stay in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2658)|
| 0:44:30| And then, you know, within one budget year, whatever we're able to finalize before each designated meeting is what gets finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2670)|
| 0:44:40| But we, as a council, at least know that there's not going to be something coming forward that we're not anticipating and that those decisions are going to be made quarterly at certain designated meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2680)|
| 0:44:58| I don't know if that helps, but might help a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Yeah, good suggestion. Thank you, Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Well, I just was making sure. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| So maybe we could do it where we do beer board the last meeting of the whatever month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| That's once a month. And maybe it's I mean, we vote on these on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| So it's not like a discussion or anything. Maybe it's the two or two's deadline is however long it takes you to do all the paperwork and whatever is ready is prior to that first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2720)|
| 0:45:34| So the non beer board meeting, I don't it's just a different arbitrary deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| The only hesitation I would have to limiting them to like twice a year or even four times a year versus once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| like a revolving deadline is you have some small organizations that might not be that organized with their deadlines and they come up with a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2747)|
| 0:45:56| And if we limit it so much that they never get the opportunity or the opportunity passes them by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| My only ask was that Savannah, I don't want to waste your time because I don't reply to your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2763)|
| 0:46:13| And maybe that's just I could do better instead of not answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| I sometimes have answered you and you come back around and you say, did you make up your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| Did you change your mind? I know you were still pending a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| I don't want you to have to invest a lot of time asking me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| If you say to me, if you want to give to this, the date is this and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| And I'll know if I'm going to give I've got to give you that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| And I've done that with you on another thing to finish out my funds for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| I said I'm going to do this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Now, I can't even remember. I lost my train of thought. But. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| Anyways, I'll leave that thought there for anybody else, though, in terms of what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| I, of course, find it helpful to look at what people prior have funded being involved in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2826)|
| 0:47:15| I had experience with what our previous council person funded. He had a particular philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| We all have our philosophy of how we're going to spend the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| So, you know, but looking at what people before me and I look at the other districts and the other council members to see how they spent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| Oh, no. The only other thing I'll add to that, Savannah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| I also wonder what the rest of council thinks when I'm looking at the website for community improvement funds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| It actually might be really interesting to have a history or information listed there, even a spreadsheet of what's been funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| There's no information here unless you go searching through the agendas to see what's funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| So I think for public information and transparency, that would be nice for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2877)|
| 0:48:05| Sure. OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| And Councilwoman Puget, you had asked those of us who've been on council how we've done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| And so we're even though we are the seniors by default, we're still new as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| But I think basically most of us have actually tried to spread our funds out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| However, I've seen some of the past council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| One year I saw a council member give the entire amount to one organization that they were very passionate about, or I've seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| And Savannah, you probably have some examples as well where they've given it the ten thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| They've divided it between two or either three organizations they were very passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Those of us who've remained on council, it appears that we have spread our money out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| tried to do so to touch as many organizations as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| That does not mean we're always able to meet their requests, per se, because Savannah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| you do have some that we are able to fulfill the entire request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| And so you just go ahead and process what has been approved by that particular council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Correct. Yes. And I do have some examples, if you'd like me to go over those real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2956)|
| 0:49:25| Council, would you guys like to hear some some of the ones that people have given their full amount or large donations to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| You can just briefly maybe. Vice Mayor. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| Mr. Frost has been trying to seek recognition. Oh, I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| Go right ahead, Mr. Frost. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2979)|
| 0:49:47| Getting back to the, you know, the quarter quarterly plan by Councilman Parker mentioned a couple of thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2987)|
| 0:49:58| The end with the city fiscal year. So those funds would not then not would then would not then be returned to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| But also listening to what Savannah was saying about organizations that sometimes are slow to get back, like the one in the case of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3006)|
| 0:50:18| Maybe an idea could be is you've you've applied for one quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| If you don't get your required paperwork in in that quarter, you're given one quarter's grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| And if you don't have your paperwork in by the end of that quarter, then you're automatically dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| So she wouldn't have to keep trying to run down an organization to do what they're supposed to do to receive the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3037)|
| 0:50:49| I think that's a good thought, because if I'm an organization that's requesting funds, the owner should be on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| And if I really want to get the funds, I should work expeditiously to do my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| I don't think that that's probably the majority of what you're seeing as the holdup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| I think the majority of the holdup is being getting responses back from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| And I know I'm guilty of it myself in the past and definitely realize that I have got to do better moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| So thank you, Mr. Frost. Councilwoman Puget. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| I think I think part of my concern. This is a learning thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| We'll roll with it. But when you're doing at large, you're really looking at trying to look all across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| And so that makes it a little more challenging because I don't want to favor one district over the other and try to because there are a lot of great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3094)|
| 0:51:43| So I'm looking at more city wide things, organizations that maybe do work across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| And that's the only reason I like the idea of having some idea of what's coming for the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| We'll just make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I can give a fast answer, but I think what's going to happen is I will wind up saying no to a lot of things because I don't know what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| Right. And thank you for pointing that out, because I would think that that is more challenging for at large representatives as a six district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3128)|
| 0:52:20| And I know others, other council members as well. We give to organizations outside of our districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| So but for you guys, I know. Yeah, you guys have to blanket pretty much want to be even kill on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| So. So, council members, I think the overarching message is when we get those requests, we need to make a decision and get those turned back in timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3153)|
| 0:52:43| So do we want to start there and then let's see how it goes for maybe a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| Savannah, if you're still seeing that there's a lot of lag time with us, then maybe we sit back down and we have another conversation about we're going to have to go to plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3170)|
| 0:53:00| Absolutely. I would like to clarify, do we want to put a deadline on those responses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| You know, a 14 day or a 30 day deadline, or do we just want to kind of see how responses come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| Now, I think that we've seen before and they haven't been because everyone's busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| And so when you see emails and we say, OK, I'll get back to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| If it has a deadline in the subject line, that's going to get our attention and that's going to make us make a decision sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| Councilwoman Fugitt. Thank you. Could we get like a month's worth at one time and know that we've got X number of days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| I think what happens is when you get one one week and another couple of weeks later, it gets kind of lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3219)|
| 0:53:48| But. Absolutely. I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Is there a certain time of month that would be better? Like the first of the month, the middle of the month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| OK, yeah, I can do that. Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| Lynn, although I like that idea, I think it starts us off with the delay right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| If someone applied in the beginning of the month and we don't get it until the end of the month, they're already four weeks behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| So I don't want to set it up where we're already running behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3258)|
| 0:54:27| Any other conversation? I'm not going to die on that hill. I'm finally on the hill to die on folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3267)|
| 0:54:38| So sounds like the majority of us are in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| Let's continue in the in the path that we're on now. But Savannah, moving forward, we'll put a deadline that we have to have a response back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| Savannah, I think if we can get a consensus, if we do not respond by that deadline, then you're going to close it out with whatever amount has been appropriated by the council members that respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3291)|
| 0:55:07| OK. Council, are you OK? Is everyone if anyone has takes issue with that approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| Please speak up. No, I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| You know, we've had a good conversation. I don't know that we've come up with the correct solution, but I know that a good step forward would be just Savannah simply give us a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3317)|
| 0:55:29| I know that would prompt me a lot better and we can try that for a while and see what kind of improvement that is and then maybe revisit this this subject later later on, you know, about whether we want to have them to come in periodically or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3329)|
| 0:55:46| But I think it's there is a consensus. Let's just have Savannah to send us a deadline that will prompt us and then we can kind of take it from there. See how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3346)|
| 0:55:59| Can I ask one other piece of information in addition to the deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3359)|
| 0:56:08| And this is adding this is adding to the load. But like the day before the deadline, if we could know how much remains, I'm trying to figure out how we don't all send in a thousand dollars at the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3368)|
| 0:56:24| Somebody gets ten thousand dollars or nine thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| I can absolutely do that. However, if I do it early in the morning or at lunch, I mean, there's still going to be that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3389)|
| 0:56:39| I can I mean, I can and we can see how it goes and see if we can come up with some other kind of solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| But that's definitely a thought. Yeah. So recommendation. And I think that's an excellent idea. Councilwoman Parker, why don't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3408)|
| 0:56:58| Let's have a 14 day deadline after that 14 day on that 14th day before the close of the day, Savannah, or maybe the following moment, the following morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3418)|
| 0:57:09| Can you send out to all council members the amount of funding that was approved for that organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| It's kind of that last call. That's our grace period. And then responses need to be by closing business that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3436)|
| 0:57:26| And after that, that's it. So with that said, Councilwoman Parker, on the 14th, that's our deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| Everyone says what they're going to appropriate in the following day. She will send out how much was allotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| So if I request a thousand dollars and on the 15th, which is the day after Savannah says this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3460)|
| 0:57:49| this organization was only appropriated for hundred dollars by council members, then that at that point, you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| if you only gave a hundred dollars, you want to bump it up, bump yours up. Or if you didn't get an opportunity to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| then you make a decision from there. Is that fair? Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| We're not saying we want everybody to wait to the last minute, but that could be a strategy that they spend on the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| So we need a running leaderboard so we can keep track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| That's what it feels like. But it puts more work on you, Savannah, and puts a little pressure on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| But at the end of the day, I think our goal is that we need to turn these around and get these organizations their funding more timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| Yeah, Gwen, I think that's a good suggestion there. You know, that gives some some guidance about who's appropriated what and how much each individual group has received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3514)|
| 0:58:45| And if we need to bump it up, we say this is a worthy cause and they're not getting enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| Then that gives us an opportunity to do that before our deadline. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| Yeah. Councilwoman, thank you. Council member Thomas. Councilman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you. Should we address giving the organization a deadline to get the paperwork in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| Would that make things more organized as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3549)|
| 0:59:20| I mean, that would that would absolutely make things more organized on my end, but I will defer to counsel counsel's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3560)|
| 0:59:31| Councilwoman Puget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| I think it's reasonable to give someone who's asking for a grant, a deadline that all the documentation needs to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| You know, I don't know what is, but it sounds to me like we've got problems on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3583)|
| 0:59:52| Trying to get all their stuff in, which then creates an emergency on our part to get something funded before their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| So I don't know what the deadline should be, but I would say that they need to at least have everything in a minimum of 30 days before the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3600)|
| 1:00:13| Because I don't know how you could turn a check around any faster than a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| You might say five, but I think there needs to be a expectation from their point of view that we can't turn that fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3618)|
| 1:00:30| So this is not a monthly application deadline or a quarterly application deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3630)|
| 1:00:49| This is just a it needs to be 30 to 45 days before your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| Is there do we want to also say you've sent in your packet and there's documents missing and I contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3655)|
| 1:01:06| Is there going to be a deadline for the follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| So after I contacted the organization and say, I still need this document, you have two weeks to provide it or three weeks to provide it or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3670)|
| 1:01:23| Or no, I mean, I think that I would say two weeks for those of you who who work nonprofits with two weeks, give you you or your staff your point person of time to get the necessary documentation back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3683)|
| 1:01:41| Yes, if you have it. And so I think the point of being clear on the front end of what you need and that you need a completed package 30 days before the event completed package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3701)|
| 1:01:53| Because if they don't have a complete package 30 days before the event, we're not going to be able to get them funded before their event anyway, because then we have 14 days to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3713)|
| 1:02:05| Okay, yeah, I think that's fair. And I think it helps because I've gotten, you know, I'm sure all of us have, but I've, I've been contacted by community members who, you know, think that they can make a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3725)|
| 1:02:23| And then next Tuesday, city council meeting, it's going to be finalized. So for more, you know, clarity, they can get about the process. I think it's better managing expectations. It's always a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3743)|
| 1:02:36| And that's so true. And I also want to take a moment and acknowledge Savannah because Savannah, I know that you have personally worked with a couple of organizations in my district that were struggling to get information and to understand the process where you have actually met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3756)|
| 1:02:55| You've been on phone calls with them. And so I do want to thank you for going above and beyond in that aspect. But again, we want to be respectful of your time, everyone's time. The second piece of that. So there's always the but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3775)|
| 1:03:09| But in the event that there's an organization who does not get their information turned in during the timeline, I think that all council members, if you could at least send us an email, letting us know that the organization will be, their application is going to be removed because of they didn't meet the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3789)|
| 1:03:32| Because nine times out of ten, someone's going to contact one of us and say, hey, I'm being mistreated because now I'm not eligible to get the funding for my event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3812)|
| 1:03:41| Sure. We already have the information. So if you can, you know, it takes all of us working together. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| Would you like me to follow up with the organization with a letter similar to the one that I provide for religious organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| I can tweak that and provide a letter to them saying, you know, I'm sorry, your application was removed because you did not meet all the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3836)|
| 1:04:05| OK, yeah, I think that would be great. Thank you. It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| OK, good dialogue. Any other further discussion or questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| Thank you all for your time. These are good changes. I'm really grateful for you staying on top of everything on both sides of the coin means a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3858)|
| 1:04:28| Yeah, absolutely. This was a very informative workshop. So thank you very much, Savannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| So very quickly before I think I give everyone a couple of minutes back before the council meeting, just want to have spoken with a couple of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3875)|
| 1:04:44| But for those of you that I have not had an opportunity to talk to, we are looking to have our city council retreat on Saturday, July the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3884)|
| 1:04:53| And so I just want to make sure that that date works for everyone. I am hopeful that by July the 18th, we will have lifted restrictions on the social distancing to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3893)|
| 1:05:08| So let's say worst case scenario is social distancing then goes up to having 20 people in a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| We are looking to have the city council retreat at the United Way building in the large room downstairs. So we will still have a lot of space between all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3915)|
| 1:05:27| So we are not going to be sitting very closely to each other. But is there anyone on the call that is not available on Saturday, July the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| Because it's imperative that we have 100% attendance because of what we're trying to achieve with our team building, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3934)|
| 1:05:45| And you can anticipate 830 to at least 330. We may close out a little bit sooner, but I would block out till 330 on that Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3945)|
| 1:05:56| Is there anyone on the call that is not able to commit to Saturday, July the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| I don't know yet. I'll look at my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Okay, could you let me know by tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will. I can let you know if I walk across the room and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| Well, all right, just text me then. Okay, sounds good. Thank you, everyone. And then the next thing again, I want to remind everyone, I know it's on our calendars, but the budget hearings, May the 14th, 830 to possibly six because public forum starts at five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3973)|
| 1:06:29| So I would anticipate us being well rested for that day because that's going to be a lot of information, a lot of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3989)|
| 1:06:39| Subsequently, May the 15th will be our second day of the budget retreat starting at 830. Public forum starts at two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| So again, just because public forum starts at two does not mean we end at two. So again, I encourage everyone to please be well rested so we can have great attention during these proceedings because these are very, very important hearings that we're going to be going through for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=4006)|
| 1:07:07| Those are the only things that I wanted to remind everyone of at this point. Is there any further discussion or comments before we close out and have a couple more minutes before our city council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=4027)|
| 1:07:21| And did the birds want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| OK, hearing no other questions or comments or concerns, the meeting is now adjourned at 538 and I will see everyone at 6 p.m. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200505?start=4042)|
