| 0:12:56| Okay. We'll just keep that timer going. Right. Go ahead, Mr. Lansing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Carl Lansing, 1201 Clinch Avenue, 37916, in the Fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| To give you all a brief history of projects I've done in the Fort, the house I'm currently residing in, I moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| I bought from the University of Tennessee about four years ago, and happily I'm in it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| And it's got me into other projects in the Fort, for good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| But this particular one is at 1805 Forest Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| It's a blighted and condemned duplex, and we're asking for a few variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| But one variance that we're not asking for, because I have a competent architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| is we're not asking for a variance on parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| We're fine with that, and basically I'd like to do an addition in the back and restore the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| And I'd like to keep the fabric of the neighborhood with a single-family house such as this intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| I've already been approached by a group that would want to buy the property and all the way to the end for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| But since restoration and moving houses, I guess, is my forte in the Fort, no pun intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| I'd like to go ahead and restore it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Okay, are you going to want your full five minutes now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Because we need to start this timer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| We probably won't take the full five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| I just wanted to go over a few things that are kind of particular about this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| As best we can tell, the previous owner had it as a duplex probably starting somewhere around 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| It's been a duplex since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| It has electrical services to both of the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and the reason we're renovating is we went to the building official to see if we could use this particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| and upgrade it, and in the process of doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| the two issues that we had to come up with was separation within the building itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| separation between the two units, and also the west wall of this building is on the west property line of this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=902)|
| 0:15:11| and because it's a small piece of property, we ended up having to ask for these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| At the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting, we got two and two for approve and two and two to reject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| so we're here to try to see if we can get this approval so we can go ahead and renovate this unit and put it back on the rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Okay, so there's nobody to speak in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| And, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Mr. Ahrens, I have a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Lance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Lance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Oh, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I might have some questions for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| So, in reviewing this case, I appreciate hearing from Mr. Lanston about what's happened with this property and his interest in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=966)|
| 0:16:17| One of the things that I noted is that this property, the last legal permitted use is as a single-family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| So, can you tell me a little bit about the history of the property with your department and how it's determined what the last legally permitted use is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=985)|
| 0:16:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| So, when folks come in and they want to get a building permit to do work on their property, a lot of times we'll make sure that the use is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| As a duplex, in an area that we know a lot of things have happened, we go back and we look in our records for any building permits that may have been pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1007)|
| 0:16:56| In the absence of building permits, we actually go back to the 62 directory and validate that whatever was in the 62 directory was grandfathered in, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1016)|
| 0:17:08| We looked for records of any sort of building permits to convert a single family into anything but that, and we were unable to find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1028)|
| 0:17:19| I wouldn't be surprised if it was used as a duplex in 68, but we just don't have any records of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| So, this was our opportunity to require the applicant to clean up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| This is very reminiscent of a BZA case that was before us just a few weeks ago and not an unusual case for the 1st District and Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1059)|
| 0:17:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| So, I may have another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Maybe don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Mr. Frost, could you remind us what the criteria are for granting variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| They are in Article 7, Section 2, Standards for Granting Variances, and I'll abbreviate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1084)|
| 0:18:12| Variances shall only be granted where special circumstances such as exceptional nearness, topography, or siding fully described in the findings of the Board do not generally apply to the District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1092)|
| 0:18:24| Two, variances shall not be granted to allow use otherwise excluded from the particular District in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| Three, for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the Board, meaning this Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| the circumstances or conditions are such that the strict applications of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1118)|
| 0:18:49| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| There must be deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| and that the granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I can ask more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| George, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I do have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| So, I guess my question at this point is, would this property require variances to bring it up to code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| Or are the variances only related to the duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| No, there's six variance requests that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| The first one was reducing the minimum front yard setback, and that's whether it's a single family or a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| A lot of times the BZA does hear those requests, and the hardship is the building was already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| and so that's the situation that you see right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| The second one is reducing the left side setback from five to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| The third one, reducing the right side setback from seven to a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| And all of those would be required no matter what the use between single or duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| The fourth one, again, reducing the minimum required width in an R2 zone from 75 to 33 and a third regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1218)|
| 0:20:27| The fifth one, reduce the minimum required lot area in an R2 zone for a duplex from 9,000 to 4433.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| That's something that is specific to a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| I would have to verify this, but I think they would require a variance if it were a single family as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| because it is a substandard lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| And then the last one is increasing the maximum lot coverage in an R2 zone from 30% to 33.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1251)|
| 0:21:01| That would be required no matter the use, so that's irrelevant of the use between single and two family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1261)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| So of the variances that are requested, there's really only one that is relevant to the current use of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| permitted or not permitted, but that is the required lot area from 9,000 to 4433.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1281)|
| 0:21:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| For a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I think those are the only questions I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Last one, Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| So like the one you just referenced, we took it point by point, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| We can break these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| I mean, because to reduce the minimum front yard setback is not for an addition that he's requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| It's for its existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| And the same with reduce the side yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| It's preexisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| And the same with the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| So none of it is for, like with the one we had a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| this is not for an addition or new construction, any of the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1331)|
| 0:22:19| The sixth variance request has something to do with an addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| but that is whether it's a single family or a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| And you all don't like the words preexisting, nonconforming, but this building actually meets that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| So one of the hardships is that it is a 33-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| That's pretty rare, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| That's pretty rare anywhere, but particularly real rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| I mean, I was shocked that I saw it when I went out there and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| So really the only one that we're really contesting, is that right, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| The only one you're really contesting is the minimum lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| I can't do anything about that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I mean, I'd have to tear part of the building down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Well, no, that's just the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| The R2 zone requires 7,500 square foot for a single family and 9,000 square foot for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| So they would require a variance no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| So is that what we're really arguing about, whether he should be allowed to have a duplex on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Is that really the contention of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| As far as you know, Mr. Johnson, how long has it been used as a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| You were saying since 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| As best we can tell, and the funny part about this particular piece of property is I knew the previous owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| but didn't realize he owned this piece of property, and that's been 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| But anyway, to make a long story short, this site was basically cut in half back sometime prior to 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| So it's been a substandard lot for that many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| and basically what we're trying to do is not only to bring it up to code because we can't use it as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| but add two bedrooms and a bath to each one of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| And if you look at the site plan, we do meet the parking requirements, which is four parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1460)|
| 0:24:30| I didn't see a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Okay, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| I'm okay with these variances, and I think we should approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| One, I think it's an R2 zone, so R2 duplexes and R2 are certainly allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| We've also got the issues of, you know, one of the variances is reducing the minimum width required from 75 to 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1491)|
| 0:25:02| Well, there's nothing they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| I mean, that's how wide the lot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| And if we want to, you know, promote housing and small lots and, you know, small projects like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| I think we should support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| And I think it's also we shouldn't forget that at the BZA it was 2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| So, you know, if that other member had been present and voted, this might not be before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| So, I would move to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Well, I was going to ask to address what Councilwoman Welch brought up, which is addressing it point by point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| I think, Mr. Ahrens, if you could clarify, we have a couple of options here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| and maybe Mr. Frost might clarify that that might involve a motion to divide the question and address them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| But, Mr. Ahrens, we can look at this to approve variances that are needed for it to be rehabbed and used in the existing footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1554)|
| 0:26:06| or approve variances, the additional variances that are needed for an addition to make it bigger than the current footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| In summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| So it was originally built in that footprint and used for a long time in that footprint, beginning as a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1577)|
| 0:26:27| And so the question at hand is, are we going to approve a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| We're going to approve some variances so that it's usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| but then is it a hardship to be able to do additional footprint and expand the footprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1595)|
| 0:26:46| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| And so, sir, I want to ask you, you kind of gave a little history that you were familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| the background and history of this property prior to purchasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| So my assumption would be that you purchased the property with the ideal to have the variances taken care of or to get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1617)|
| 0:27:07| Did you have a backup plan in the event that these got denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| My projected owner has not purchased the lot yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| We're trying to get it to where we can use it, and then he'll purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| So it has not been purchased yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Very good fact to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| So I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| I mean, what I'm hearing from Mr. Ahrens is that regardless of whether this is used as a single family or duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| in order to bring the house up to code, it will require variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| Or would it just be legal nonconformity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| If it were a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| You hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| No matter what we do right now, you know, it's got to have a goodly portion of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| actually all of the variances in order for us to put that piece of property back in production, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| Could I just clarify with you, Mr. Ahrens, if I could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| I just want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| So if this were coming before us as, well, it might not even come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| If it were just going to be put to use as a single family, would it still require variances to bring it up to code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| If it's strictly interior renovations and the use is legal and there's no reason for us to verify setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1704)|
| 0:28:34| then we don't go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| It's when there's an addition and we need to start measuring for setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| we need to make sure that, I think it's Article 5, no, Article 6 about nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| We need to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| We need to verify lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| And so that's how we got to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| But if somebody wants to remodel an existing dwelling, we don't get into site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| We wouldn't be going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| So this is the part that's a little bit of a challenge for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| because if we look at the way the code defines the requirements for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and the hardship for a variance, financial hardship, I mean, lot size is a consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| but it wouldn't be a factor if this were being used as it's permitted as a single family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1764)|
| 0:29:34| If there was going to be an addition to a single family residence, we would be here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| When we need to verify those particular items on a site plan, we don't just identify the new nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| We take it as an opportunity to bring the whole property into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| And essentially those items that are preexisting nonconforming, that is a true hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| And historically those blow through BZA without any question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| It's when we're increasing the size of a structure or creating a new nonconformity that sometimes we end up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1808)|
| 0:30:19| It's just a little tough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| I must have to say, though, the existing building does not meet the building code with respect to that west wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| We don't think that it meets the requirement of a one-hour separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| And therefore, in order for us to get there, we've got to do something to that wall for both units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1838)|
| 0:30:47| which requires a building permit, which requires variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| And when I go in for a building permit, the first thing that happens is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| okay, Lynn, you don't have enough room to put that building on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| And the bottom line is that existing building doesn't meet the setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1862)|
| 0:31:12| Well, this is in my district, so I'll say that, first of all, Mr. Lansdon, thank you for investing in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| It sounds like you live in Fort Sanders as well, so this is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and I'm so glad that you're investing in a community that really needs the kind of investment that you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| I really do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| I also agree with Councilman Stair in that this is an R2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| We're looking for opportunities to make sure that we have housing in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| and this is an appropriate use in an R2 zone is a duplex, so I also appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| I'm just a little uncomfortable but inclined to support Councilman Stair's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| only because it is also a community that has the character of the community has changed over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| due to the illegal use of single-family homes as duplexes, triplexes, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| and I want to be mindful of the burden that that's created on the community and that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| while also honoring the fact that this is sort of a unique circumstance with the small lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| and it would require variances regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| The irony is, along with Lynn, the owner that I have this under contract with has owned this since the early 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1951)|
| 0:32:41| and it's KUB separately metered, and it's been a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and so we parsed it somewhere with the research that he was available to get was 1968-ish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| and so that made me feel more comfortable with the non-conforming such as this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| So we have a motion and we have a second, and you're saying you're going to support that motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| Okay. Could I just get – I'll go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| Mr. Ahrens, could you just clarify something that was said, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| To renovate in the existing footprint does not require variances. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| If you change the occupancy from a single family to a two-family, then we need to verify the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| So if there's something that's part of the application that makes us look at a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| that's when we jump into the site plan and we – if there's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Okay. So I just want to clear it up for everybody's understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and for the public record because it bothers me when it's misstated, no offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| is that if I bought that property tomorrow and I said I want to go down and pull a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| and renovate the entire interior as single family, I don't need variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| I don't need a variance for the firewall to do it as a single family because it's existing non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| I just did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Right. You would not need zoning variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Okay. Thank you for clarifying that for the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| You would get them on the building code side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| But that's not BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| So then when he calls for an inspection, you're going to say you've got to make –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay, because that's not the experience I just had, so I just wanted to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Oh, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I want everybody to understand building code. Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| So there's two paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| There's zoning compliance and there's building code compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Zoning has setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Building also regulates walls within a certain distance of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| When you're within three foot, you need a rated assembly there so that fire doesn't spread from building to building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| If Mr. Johnson were to come in and say, you know what, I'm going to leave the walls where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| I'm going to leave the windows where they are, I just want to redo the interior, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| He's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| We're not going to make an issue from the zoning side or the building side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| Correct. So I do understand that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| I do, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Okay. We got that solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| We have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| We can rehab these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| 11C is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Integrated Response Systems, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2140)|

| 0:35:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2157)|

| 0:36:01| 11C is the resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into Amendment 2 to Agreements No. 150169| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| with the Tennessee Department of Transportation for the Liberty Street Multimodal Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| increasing the right-of-way phase of the project by $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| I do have a question for Director Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| So the date in the contract was projected, I can't remember if it was completion date or breaking ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| was summer 2021, which is a year and a half away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Am I getting too nuanced there for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Because we're just in right-of-way acquisition, this is to outsource right-of-way acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| so that's why it's a year and a half and it's going to take some time to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| I'm just wondering where the time frame comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| I'm Tim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| I apologize I didn't bring my schedule with me, but a year and a half out sounds about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| There is a lot of right-of-way on this one and there's always uncertainties about time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| when you get into a lot of right-of-way issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| And this contract is to hire somebody to take care of, an outside party to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| the right-of-way process for us or participate in it for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| just because we don't have the capacity to make it move very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| So a year and a half sounds believable, but I don't have that paper in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| Okay, I'm just making sure it was in the realm of reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| Pellissippi State, Division Street, we're very excited about this project, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2269)|

| 0:38:10| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I just had some questions for Director Hageman again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| Can you tell me about where this project is compared to the money that we're spending on the gateway project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2300)|
| 0:38:29| Because it seems to be in the same area, same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Yeah, it is in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| This is an extension of that gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| It's into the James White Parkway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| We're looking at how we can connect the gateway park, stitch it up into the adjacent neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2322)|
| 0:38:52| and connect it with downtown and future connections downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| and open up other options for connecting the urban wilderness network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| Okay, so previously we were kind of going into the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| This is getting to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| And by the way, I just should add that just recently one of the things we were waiting on was, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| TDOT under Governor Haslam gave us the land as a terminus and beyond, which is what we're building out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| Just recently TDOT approved, their property committee approved transferring the land from the end of the bridge south to the terminus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2371)|
| 0:39:42| to the city, and then we'll also have right-of-way, I don't know what the right term is, across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| So this is what, so part of this is the study on how all of that will occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| and then how it stitches and knits into the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| So it's the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2397)|

| 0:43:32| I'm really excited to see these infrastructure improvements in South Knoxville, and I think we're saving a little bit of money by the way we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| So could you maybe just explain to us, give us a little bit of background about the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| This is a project within the South Waterfront, which is also in our South Waterfront Redevelopment Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Back in March of 2019, you all approved a budget request for public infrastructure improvements within the South Waterfront Redevelopment District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2632)|
| 0:44:02| to support the necessary upgrades, utility upgrades that's needed for any private investment within that South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2642)|

| 0:44:13| It's located at 726 Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Being in the South Waterfront Redevelopment Area, we have KCDC as our redevelopment authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| and Ben Bentley, I believe, is here as well, as well as Peter Hall, the developer for Dominion Group LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| What happens here, we take the money that we have requested, the funds that we have requested to support that public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2670)|
| 0:44:39| and we loan that to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| They work out a development agreement, which they've already gone through the process with KCDC boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| to work out a development agreement with the developer to put in the public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| What happens here, we have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| We can either put that project out to bid with the capital funds that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| or we can use having the developer already on site, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| He's already working on a private investment, and utilize the services of them already being mobilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| and establish a cost for them to do the work on the city's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| And that's where KCDC comes in to work that development agreement with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| However, the city comes in and will hire the CEI consultant that will oversee the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| to make sure we're getting the best quality of work based on specifications and city requirements as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2727)|

| 0:46:33| if the tax values are assessed by Knox County to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2793)|

| 0:46:51| so we're just adding the additional addresses to the pilot that we had already approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| We're going through and just cleaning up language because it's going forward for a pilot lease when it goes to City IDB for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| We just want to do the checks and balances and making sure that all the language is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2830)|

| 0:47:20| he was in the process of buying those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2840)|

| 0:47:33| But it took some time for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Once he did that, he also had a request to close right away at Lamar Street, which expanded their parcel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| So we just had to clean up some language and get the maps correct to get it ready to go to City IDB to finalize the pilot lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2863)|
| 0:47:53| All right. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Mr. Nash, we're looking forward to this project and seeing you build upon that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Ms. Foster, if you wouldn't mind, you were saying it's sort of a technicality that we approved this about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Yes, I believe it was back in, I want to say in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| So this is becoming one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| He has, I think it's a total of four, and I think he may one lot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| Jeffrey, I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| I think he's trying to get up to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Yes. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Jeffrey Nash, the Courtland Group, 109 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| May I ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| So what's the question for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| So this is going to be, what I was trying to determine was, we already voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| We were just sort of waiting for that other piece of land to be able to join it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| So if it's going to be one parcel, isn't the decision made about that the pilot would just transfer to all of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2942)|
| 0:49:13| Well, that's why we're cleaning up the parcel site, because you have four parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| He was in the action of adding additional parcel to expand the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| I think he moved from eight units and now moving to 22 units and having more square footage for more commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| And so that's very important to get all that tax map correct in order to get the payment in lieu of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| and getting the property values correct in the calculations when he goes in for the pilot lease terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| My concern is that a year ago, things were a little bit different than they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Between all of the work being done in Happy Hollow and it's right across the street from Knoxville High Senior Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| To me, that's now prime property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| I don't think that we need a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I don't think that's necessary in order for anybody to choose to develop that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| Housing is in demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| I think it will be profitable without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Well, I think we look at these as case by case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| At that time, 104 East 5th, it was a vacant, blighted building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| One of the things that we try to thrive to do is try to repurpose those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| And so it was vacant, blighted, and it also had gone through a facade grant, but it didn't move further after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| One of our objectives is to move from the downtown core out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| We were sitting there with an empty vacant building on a corner lot right across from Knox High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| that was redeveloping at the site right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| So we think it pretty much was set a catalyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| And then we did go through the but-for analysis with Municap, the third-party reviewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| and it goes through many processes with city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| So we thought it was valuable to try to push this pilot application on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| and take it to a third-party review that determines that but-for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| which means but-for this pilot it would not be financially possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| Well, I like what's happening where downtown and the Happy Hollow kind of meeting and everything developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| 12A is an emergency ordinance enacting a moratorium of 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| upon the granting of any application for new institutional zoned parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| and upon the granting of any new sign applications in institutional zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| while the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission studies and makes a recommendation to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| as to whether Article 13.9F of the City of Knoxville Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| should be amended to create sign regulations in institutional zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| We have two people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| The first is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| Ms. Feld, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| and as you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| First, I just want to thank the mayor and all the outgoing council members for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| and let you know that I've certainly appreciated working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| I know you've all gotten a lot of phone calls from me over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| I appreciate your reception and your willingness to talk to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and work with me in scenic Knoxville, so I'll miss you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| Scenic Knoxville supports a 120-day moratorium on new signs in the industrial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| to give city council time to agree on and adopt specific and appropriate sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3176)|
| 0:53:06| The sign ordinance that passed in 2015 took over three years to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| I represented scenic Knoxville on the city council's sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Council Member Wallace represented city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| and many of you were intimately involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Maximum sign heights and sizes were of great concern to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| and were carefully studied and widely debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| This is about standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| This is about having signed standards for the institutional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| which currently the ordinance lacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| The ordinance in effect now, the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| includes specific standards that are based on both roadway type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| and the zone where the property is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| and the institutional zone deserves no less consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| It deserves its own set of specific and appropriate standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| Standards are specified for future use, and while the past informs us and guides us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| it does not always anticipate future use and needs accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| So specific sign standards should be codified for properties that are zoned institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| and this moratorium will give council an opportunity to consider those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| Also, I don't want to get in the weeds too much here because I know you all want to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Me too. I have a Christmas party to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| But there's some confusion, I think, about the size of parcels that can be zoned institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| and I was hoping that Director Green would actually clear that up before I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| But Director Green and his staff studied properties that were deemed or zoned institutional on the new map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3286)|
| 0:54:57| and they used a criterion of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| And using that criteria, they determined that if you leave sign standards dependent just on roadway type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3300)|
| 0:55:13| the situation, it would all be fine and it would work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| However, I think it needs to be clarified that in the ordinance that you all enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| and that goes into effect on January 1st, the minimum lot size for institutional zoning is actually 20,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| which is less than half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| So what that means is that you could easily have inappropriate signage within a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| If you have an institutional zone for a private school or a church or even an office, which are all allowed in institutional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3341)|
| 0:55:51| you could easily have residential lots abutting and surrounding that institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| And I don't think anybody wants to live in a residential zone, wants to live next to a 10- or 20-foot pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3358)|
| 0:56:07| So I don't understand why there's a reluctance to delineate specific standards for this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| but Scenic Knoxville certainly thinks that they need to be specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Next is Ms. Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Please set your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, 37918, and also members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| I've appreciated your service, Mayor Broughero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you, and you are going to be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| But you'll wake up in the morning and feel so happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Words of a former councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Says experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| I'm here in favor of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| For all the reasons Ms. Feld stated, some of the history on the issue of signs in the institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| and also the next item, MPC's power to give additional signs in commercial and industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| In August, at the meeting when you approved recode, these sign issues had been identified and had not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| At that meeting, you asked if we were comfortable approving recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| with the understanding that these two issues would be addressed by council prior to the January 1 effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| At that time, Kevin Murphy was here for scenic Knoxville, and he said he was indeed comfortable with that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| I was here, and I said I wasn't because I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| I'm never comfortable in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| For whatever reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Can we quote you on that, Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| And please put two seconds back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| For whatever reasons, you have not had the opportunity to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| That is why a moratorium is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| One thing must be totally clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| Due to the state grant-rathering law, in the absence of a moratorium, any legal sign that goes up in the institutional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3486)|
| 0:58:14| regardless of how inappropriate, may well remain forever, long after the business closes, the office closes, the school closes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| or the sign requirements are changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| That's why a moratorium is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| We have to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Regarding the Planning Commission study, frankly, it looked at detached signs but did not look at attached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| Attached signs are wall signs, signs on mansard roofs, as well as on the wall of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| The study only evaluated detached signs, like pole signs and monument signs, which are related to road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| But attached signs are independent of road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| And there is an enormous difference between what is allowed in the office zone and what is allowed in the commercial and industrial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| and its commercial and industrial sign size, that is being proposed for the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| The attached signs in the office zone are limited to 5% of the wall area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| and that's providing that the wall area does not face a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| In the office zone, the maximum sign area of 24 square feet is allowed for any one individual wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3562)|
| 0:59:33| And signs may not be internally illuminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| They can be externally illuminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| You can shine a light on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Contrast the office attached sign regulations with the attached sign regulations of commercial and industrial now proposed for institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| The attached sign size goes from 5% of the wall area to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| And it includes all walls, including those walls that face residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| Unlike the office zone, where your individual wall sign is limited to 24 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| there is no limit on the size of the individual signs in the commercial and industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| which would be applied to institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| Signs in institutional zones need to be carefully considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| These are sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| These issues have not been properly sorted out, perhaps because the institutional zone was not in draft one of RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| The institutional zone was added along with the office park zone to RECODE draft two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| And the IOP, industrial office park district, which was in draft one, was removed in draft two of RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3634)|
| 1:00:43| As you know, RECODE was an enormous project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Everything didn't get sorted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| This is the opportunity to sort these things out and sort them out in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| It is essential that these issues be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| So please approve the moratorium and sleep well tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| I think what we need to look at first in this is, during the RECODE process, we had a lot that was on our plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3670)|
| 1:01:22| And what I would want to ask Mr. Frost is what we just heard about with the institutional zone and signs in institutional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3682)|
| 1:01:35| whether or not that's a substantive change to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Well, as you heard Mrs. Malone discuss, the institutional zone did not exist previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3703)|
| 1:01:54| I recall from the many, many RECODE conversations that signs were just going to simply be moved in totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3714)|
| 1:02:08| Signs weren't going to be, I guess, tinkered with for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| But in RECODE, a new category of zoning was created, and there's a gap because institutional zoning sign regulations did not exist before that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3732)|
| 1:02:26| So there's been a change, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| Just for recollection, this council had committed to not making substantive changes of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| That's really what this 120-day moratorium is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| I want to also say that I apologize to my fellow council members for not getting this out sooner to you so we could have co-sponsors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3764)|
| 1:02:55| and have this reviewed in that kind of regular process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| I was expecting that just like Item 12C, these items would come up on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| They weren't, so I had to place them on the agenda by having the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| I think it's important to remember that we did commit to not making substantive changes to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| If you go back and you look at the agenda items when Planning Commission reviewed this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| what was said in that was staff should develop the sign regulations for institutional and report back to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| There was no report coming to City Council without this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| And so there's a substantive change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| There was no report coming back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| And what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| That interferes with our ability to involve ourselves in the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| So the 120 days, what it really does is it gives Planning Commission time to come back to us with recommendations and alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3828)|
| 1:04:00| And then we can legislate what those changes should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| Obviously, we can get in the weeds in this one, just like we did in nine ten-hour meetings of RECODE, and I don't think we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| But I would hope that a majority of Council would support this 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| It basically just puts us back where we are currently today with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| So a question for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Did Planning study this issue and kind of what happened after the discussion around RECODE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3869)|
| 1:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Gerald Green, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| The Planning Commission actually considered this twice, once during the development of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| and felt that the institutional zone assigned standards for the commercial and industrial districts were appropriate for the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3886)|
| 1:04:56| Following a personal request as opposed to a Council-wide request from Councilmember Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| the Planning Commission considered it again and took no action at their November Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| Because they took no action, all I did was forward the report to Councilmember Roberto for his use and whatever he wanted to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3910)|
| 1:05:20| But, again, the Planning Commission took no action, decided not to amend the ordinance, felt that the assigned standards as proposed were appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3920)|
| 1:05:29| One of the reasons was that, first of all, we do use roughly five acres of this criteria for identifying institutionally zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3929)|
| 1:05:39| Within that zoning district, there is a lot size area requirement of 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| It's like I live in an R1 zoning district, which has a 10,000 square foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| It doesn't mean the zone is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| It means one lot within that zoning district can be 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| So the zone is, again, approximately five acres is the minimum for the institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| We have one case where there's a school that's less than five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| To try to clear that up, there is a minor amendment going to the Planning Commission next month in the institutional zoning district purpose statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3969)|
| 1:06:20| There will be a phrase added that institutionally zoned areas should be a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| In looking at this, the Planning Commission planning staff reviewed 16 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| They looked for properties where within 200 feet of the institutional zoning, more than 5% of that property was zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=3993)|
| 1:06:42| We found 16 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Again, this is taking an institutionally zoned property, looking at the zoning within 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| 16 parcels had more than 5% of that area within 200 feet zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| Of those 16 parcels, 15 are owned by the county or the state and are not subject to the county zoning or the city zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4016)|
| 1:07:06| The Planning Commission felt that the concern about the impact on residential properties was not enough of a concern to open up the sign ordinance again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4026)|
| 1:07:19| and devote the right amount of staff time to something that would likely have negligible impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| We will monitor this, keep an eye on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Again, to try to assuage any concern about small areas being zoned institutional, which was the concern both Ms. Malone and Ms. Feld had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4049)|
| 1:07:38| we are amending the ordinance to say that institutionally zoned areas should be a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| Why we don't do it may be because the last time the sign ordinance was opened, it took three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| To be honest, we don't have the staff resources right now, given the work we have to do with the general plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| looking at South Waterfront again, looking at a number of other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| that it may be faster to put together a signed task force if you decide to go ahead with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| to put together a signed task force and have them look at the sign ordinance and the institutional sign standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| because I fear that our staff could not get to it in 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| So, Mr. Green, you all have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| You've actually looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| You just said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| We looked at it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| So, the assertion that we haven't looked at it and we haven't spent time on it is not really accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| You've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| You all looked at it again and decided to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| You thought what's in place is appropriate and it defines it well enough going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Since the planning commission decided to take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| this is one of the first times where typically when the planning commission takes no action, it just dies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| So, I wasn't sure where to go with the report of the council action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Again, since the request came as an individual request from Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| I did send him the report to see what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| The planning commission did hold a public hearing on this, had comments from Ms. Malone and Ms. Feld with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| I can't remember if anyone from the Chamber of Commerce or other groups spoke at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| but I know Ms. Feld and Ms. Malone spoke at the planning commission hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| I appreciate their input and their concern for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| but it seems that there may be a solution in search of a problem at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| So, let me just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| The MPC meeting, which I watched, they spoke and you guys had a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| Maybe I'm losing my mind, but I thought there was some form of a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| It was a vote to not take any action to amend the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| So, that deems it not that it doesn't come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| We've never had an instance like this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Typically, when the planning commission does not approve something, it dies there unless someone appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| To be quite honest, I sent the report to Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| and I'm not sure if I mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I'll have to go back and look at the email to see if I mentioned the planning commission's action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| But I didn't know what to do with it because the council, again, the commission vote was to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4229)|
| 1:10:38| I just don't remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| I mean, I guess we've slept a lot since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| I don't remember it just being a request out of Councilman Roberto, but maybe I'm unclear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| I thought it was part of the list of things to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| Again, the planning commission took that list and looked at it prior to the adoption of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4252)|
| 1:11:00| The next time it came was as an individual request via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| I have that email from Councilman Roberto, not from the council as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| Hold on, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| You know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| One of the council members needs to ask you a question to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| Ms. Malone, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| This is a resolution of council approved unanimously by council asking that these two issues be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4278)|
| 1:11:28| It was not a personal request from Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| Councilman Roberto, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| That's what I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Number two, the five-acre sites were hand-selected by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| Going forward, anybody who has a lot with 20,000 square feet or more can apply for institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| That's what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Can I just clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Mr. Green can answer this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| I'm off the cuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| If I have my money, I can go apply for a rezoned institutional if I have a 20,000 square foot lot and I meet the criteria for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4319)|
| 1:12:09| Staff could not recommend or deny, but they could approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| And the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| The staff would only recommend it would come to the Planning Commission and then to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| So the burden would be on the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Again, the ordinance amendment that will come to you following the Planning Commission's consideration in January and likely will come to you in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4344)|
| 1:12:35| The purpose statement of the institutional zone is a statement that areas zoned institutional should be a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| So, again, this serves an additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Anyone with Council's approval, anyone can zone any piece of property, anything that you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| This places some burden on you and your successors to make wise decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| Again, I can't predict what this body will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| But with those safeguards, what we're trying to put in place in the purpose statement of the institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| it makes clear, first of all, that it's a campus-like environment and that it should be a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| So if your successors are willing to approve of rezoning for something that's not a campus-like setting and it's not a minimum of five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4393)|
| 1:13:22| the burden is on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| We shouldn't speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| But the minimum of five acres isn't in there currently, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| That is an amendment that you guys have coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| So let me clarify with Council Attorney Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| If we make a moratorium for a certain amount of time and the amendment passes and that appeases concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| can we end the moratorium prematurely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| Yes, the way it's drafted, Council Member Ryder, it can be ended before the 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| So if the missing component is clarity on the size of what is appropriate for an institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4441)|
| 1:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| The problem is the amendment that's coming forward says should, which is not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| The table that says 20,000 square foot lot minimum remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| Should means nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| It's a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| It is not mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| It is not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| As drafted, it does not do anything except urge somebody to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| You know, I'm sorry, but the facts are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| 20,000 square foot is the lot requirement size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| If you want to change that, don't use the word should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| Use another word, shall or must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| There are issues with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Please take the time to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| It's one thing to say nothing's going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| St. Joseph's School, take that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| On Cedar Lane, that's on the new zoning maps institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4512)|
| 1:15:20| You approve, you deny the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| That school on January 2nd can come in, get poll signs, get illuminated twice the size wall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4524)|
| 1:15:37| That's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Now, you can all hope to God nobody approves it and we come down and appeal it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| But if you don't want that to happen, take the time to study it and change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| I'm going to support Councilmember Berta's moratorium until there's more clarity on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I don't understand why there's the arbitrary looseness on this particular zone versus other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| It needs to be straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| And that is what we asked for, to my memory, is a report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you, Council Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Councilwoman, I just lost it just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4579)|
| 1:16:27| Councilwoman Ryder pretty much addressed the issue that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| I'm sorry I started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| And that is, do we really need 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| And the answer is, only if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| And if the process moves as it's currently proposed, it doesn't look to me like you will need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| So I'm inclined to support this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Well, he said you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| He said he couldn't get it done in four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| We can provide the report that the Planning Commission had, a report of their action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| and the amendment that now says should, and this body certainly has the option to change it to shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| will be before you in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Beyond that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Again, if you want something more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I would recommend a faster track would be to put together a signed task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| and have them address the signed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| That was actually going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| So if this moratorium is put in place, what process will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| what happens then in order to address the concerns that people have about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| Because what I'm hearing, and you just said it again, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| that this is probably, MPC has looked at this, Planning has looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| the Commission has looked at it, made a report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| We haven't seen the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Apparently Councilman Roberto has, but the rest of us have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| How does this issue get resolved to Council's satisfaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| That's the part I'm not quite clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| Because I don't think it was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| I don't think it was clear to Planning how the issue was supposed to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| So I think we need to decide if we're going to vote on a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| what has to happen in order for that moratorium to be lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| I would certainly appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| because I thought the Planning Commission did what it was asked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| it considered, it decided to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| I would appreciate some clarity, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| to try to address the concern about the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| We did propose an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| So just some direction, and again, due to our workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| The process, just to get it a bit in the weeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| is if you direct Planning to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| that request goes to our Planning Commission Executive Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| They place that task on our work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| and then based on resources and time available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| staff resources and time available, we will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| If you ask for an amendment to the sign ordinance, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| that's likely a low priority given the other tasks we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| So I'm not sure when the sign ordinance amendment will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| It sounds like it's been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Are you comfortable with just changing the wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Would we do that, as you were saying, in February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| I am comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| The Planning Commission seems to be speaking on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| because their vote to take no action on amending the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| sign standards for institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| was, I believe, unanimous when I looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| from our Planning Commissioner, Mr. DeVille.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Not on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| It was not unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| But there's still majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| It was a majority, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| I feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| I think that there are a lot of things that we need to look at with recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| and this is lower on the priority if we can fix it with just a word change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| So I think we need to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| it sounds like Councilmember Roberto has some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| that he's received back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| If Council could get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| I'm definitely in favor of moving forward with the 120-day moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| but I think that we've got to get that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| and then maybe have a work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| to see if there's any other additional changes that need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| so we can move forward and get this completed within that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| I just want to comment on something Councilwoman Welch said to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| Mr. Frost, what action does it take to end the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| How do we clear that from the queue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| If something comes to us from February's MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| that satisfies what we're looking for, I said if, then what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| Do we say, hey, we'd like to end this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Let's put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| We just have to speak up and say what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| I got a phone call saying whatever ambiguities have been resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| and someone requested I place an ordinance on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| and I'll type it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Gerald, you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| You've done what you were requested to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| You've looked at it, and your report back is that no action was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| That's the Planning Commission's decision, and I will forward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| So you did what was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| We asked you to look at it, and they asked you to get back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| and there's your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| We feel like you've done enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| That report and recommendation to you or action to you tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| And, again, I apologize for not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| The latest request I got was an individual e-mail request from Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| We looked at it based on that request using, in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| his language from his e-mail for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| And when the commission took no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| There's your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| I apologize for not sending that to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| It was a first time for something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| and typically when the commission takes no action or denies something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| it just dies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Maybe it's postponed it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| and then get that report and go from there instead of having a moratorium on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| You're going to have it next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| I'll send it to you tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| I'll send it to Mr. Johnson so it can be put in the official records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| So we have, do you want to speak again, Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Ms. Feld, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| I just wanted to say that I don't think that working this out is that big of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| I mean, Mr. Green is talking about, you know, reconstituting the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| I really don't think any of that is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| The primary concern here is signage as it relates to the institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| that abuts or is surrounded by residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| And I just don't think that this is very time consuming to come up with those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| In fact, Scenic Knoxville made recommendations for specific standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| at the Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| and we'd be happy to share those with you and you can review them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| and decide whether or not you want to adopt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| Or I guess it would be not you, but the next council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| But I don't think that, you know, this is not reopening a three-year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| where everything from A to Z was reviewed in the signed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| And I'll just close by saying, you know, I think we need to receive a report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| so that we can initiate the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| There's already been some discussion today about what potential solutions would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| They can be as simple as maybe some changed words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| If that occurs, then we can end the moratorium much faster than 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| If we find that we need more time to have the legislative process work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| and figure things out, then we have more time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| So this is really about just allowing us to engage in the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| So we have a motion and a second to pass the moratorium of 120 days, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| George, I mean, Councilman Wallace and Councilwoman Singh, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| So it passes 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| I just want to say that I'm sorry I won't be around to chair the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| where you all are discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| If they put the sign task force back together, you and Councilmember Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| You're really clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Put a moratorium on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Pass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Pass 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Now, 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| 12B is an emergency ordinance enacting a moratorium of 120 days upon the granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| of any new sign applications under Article 13.9F5E of the City of Knoxville Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| while the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| and makes recommendation to City Council as to whether it should be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| to have sign applications reviewed by the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| or otherwise limit the zones where Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| may grant additional signs to be more consistent with those limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| in the present sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| I have two people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Kathleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| I ask that you approve the moratorium and provide additional time to consider whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| or not you want to invite requests for additional signs in almost every commercial parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| along Broadway, Magnolia, Chapman Highway, Kingston Pike, Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| which is exactly what this provision does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| It invites requests for additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| And I ask, this is raising an issue, and I ask you to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| how you want to spend your time on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| Do you want to spend your time dealing with a parcel-by-parcel consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| of additional signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| Each parcel along Kingston Pike and Broadway can come in and request this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| Or do you want to work on issues that are more important to the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| If you want commercial properties to have more signs than they are presently allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| then change the sign ordinance and give them the right to have more signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| have additional signs, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| We're willing to involve ourselves in that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| But please tell the people who sent you here, who elected you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| that you think your job is bigger than a parcel-by-parcel decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| on who gets an additional sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| The changes to Article 13, Section 13.9 F5E represents a substantive change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| There is no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| At the outset of recode, council, MPC, and the public agreed not to make substantive changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| to the sign provisions of the zoning ordinance as part of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| And in fact, Councilman Wallace recognized and honored that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| He recently proposed and council approved two changes to the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| to fix the problems that he had identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| But he did it separate from recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| Why is this a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| It expands the Planning Commission's power to approve additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| from a few planned zones in the existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| to almost all commercial properties in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| The existing sign ordinance allows MPC to approve additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| only in planned zoning districts specifically identified as PC1, PC2, Shopping Center 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| Shopping Center 2, Shopping Center 3, BP1, and I1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| There are probably fewer than 30 planned commercial and shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| and BP properties developments in all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| All but two of these zones, Shopping Center 1 and I1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| have minimum lot areas of 5 to 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| Contrast the 30 or so planned commercial or shopping center developments in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| with the thousands of parcels zoned CG and CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| It is CG and CH that are the zones that line Broadway, Magnolia, Chapman, Kingston Pike, Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| Each owner will be able to request an additional sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5351)|
| 1:29:20| That is enormous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| To hear that MPC is stressed for time and to open this floodgate just blows my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| How do we want to spend our resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| And the minimum lot size for CG and CH are not acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| CG has no minimum lot size and it's 10,000 square feet, a quarter of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| CH and IG, 15,000 for CR, and two acres for RD, I-RD, which is not on Broadway in our materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5387)|
| 1:29:59| The planned zones require uses on review, the approval of a detailed development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| which requires such things as listing the uses, the architecture of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| the restrictive covenants, the landscaping, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| These planned districts are deleted in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| Planned zones, by virtue of the use on review, provides both the context and the process for considering additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| The non-planned zones do not have uses on review, do not have the context or the process for considering additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5423)|
| 1:30:36| The difference in the number of potential requests is incredible when the zones go from a few planned zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| to almost all commercial zones in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| Is this the best use of the Planning Commission's time, the best use of your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| hearing requests on appeals for one additional sign open to every commercial parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5450)|
| 1:30:59| If there's a need for additional signs because of topography, there's BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5459)|
| 1:31:09| If there's a need for additional signs because of additional buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| and the relationship of multi-structure, the sign ordinance has a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| Article 13, Section 13.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| Approve the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| Provide time to consider whether or not you want to invite additional signs on every commercial parcel in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| The next speaker is Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Joyce Fell, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| Scenic Knoxville urges you to approve this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| I agree with everything that Ms. Malone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| I think she said it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| I just want to, again, draw your attention to the 2015 sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| Not only were strict standards included for sign height and sign size, which I mentioned previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| but the number of additional signs and their sizes allowed in commercial and industrial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5519)|
| 1:32:06| was also discussed at length and clearly specified in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| To now allow additional signs in these districts without first delineating specific standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| whereby they can be approved defeats the intent of the signed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Now we have one person to speak against it, Amy Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| Please state your name and address for the record, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Amy Nolan, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| I do, I want to speak against, on behalf of the Chamber and our 2,400 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| speak against putting a moratorium for signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| First of all, I do not believe that businesses will rush out to buy additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| They are an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| It is not a permit they are going to seek unless they feel like they have a hardship and need that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| That has not been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I don't believe in past practice that additional signs have been opened in the floodgates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| In the new zoning ordinance, there are specific criteria before they can, that commission has to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| They cannot detract from the character of the development or surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| and the development plan has to clearly show that because of the unusual topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| building locations, and relationships or developments with multiple structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| additional signs are essential to inform and direct the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| and that is specifically from our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| It does not say that Knoxville, Knox County Planning Commission should approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| It says they may approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| It does not require the commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| This would, I think, mostly impact small business owners who are operating on very thin margins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| 120-day moratorium in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| They still have expenses like payroll, taxes, rent, and all those other obligations to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| so they do not have an avenue to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| Lastly, I do believe that the zoning ordinance lays plenty of time for public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| If there is a request for additional sign, we rely on the expertise of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| There will be public notice, a sign, notification to surrounding or surrounding property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5669)|
| 1:34:39| and all the usual public notice requirements that the planning commission requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| In closing, I would say that I think placing the moratorium for six months to address whatever concerns this would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5687)|
| 1:34:56| would be like using a sledgehammer to swat a fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Mr. Frost, I'll probably start the same way we did the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| When you're looking at Section 13.9 F5E, does that represent a substantive change from what the current sign ordinance allows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5711)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| First, I want to clarify what Mrs. Nolan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| A six-month moratorium, what's being proposed is a 120-day moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| Now to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Yes, I think you heard Ms. Feld and former Councilmember Malone discuss the substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5738)|
| 1:35:48| One may arrive with that opinion, that there have been substantive changes because of the different types of zoning classifications under RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5748)|
| 1:36:01| Again, Council made a commitment not to make substantive changes during the RECODE process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| I would ask that Council do this again here as we did in the item previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| Again, I apologize for not getting this out to everyone sooner, but like 12C, I was expecting 12B to come up on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5772)|
| 1:36:22| This specific provision in the current sign ordinance allows a process in planned development zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5782)|
| 1:36:33| You heard a little bit of discussion about those different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| None of those are in RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| There are no planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| They require a development plan in the current sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| They have, for the most part, 5 to 40 acre minimum lot size requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| This change opens up the provision to be used in additional zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| We're not talking about all additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| We're talking about only using this specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| This language was specifically designed for planned commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| It's now being expanded out beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| That's what you're hearing about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| The new zones would be CG, CH, CR, IRD, and IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| There aren't any standards in these expanded zones for additional signs under this specific provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5838)|
| 1:37:26| that are comparable to what is currently required under the Use of Review Development Plan in Shopping Center and other planned commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5846)|
| 1:37:35| So that's why this is being brought to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Again, it's being brought that if we resolve this issue, we can relieve the 120 days earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| But I wanted to make sure we clarified the issue about whether or not this applied to all signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| It's only this one specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Yeah, it's all signs in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| It's not all signs up and down Kingston Pike and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| That's not what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| This is for hardship cases, right, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| This is for you, the Planning Commission, to be able to make exceptions when you see it's fit, when you have the appropriate drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| when you're looking at it and you're approving it as opposed to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Gerald Green, Knoxville and Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| This would be for exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| And just to clarify a couple of things, there was a comment that planned districts are minimum lot size is 5 to 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| The minimum lot size is much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| That's a suggestion for the area that should be zoned, a planned commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| In addition, one request the Planning Commission has had for an additional signage under this provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| there was no development plan for the entire shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| It was one lot within a shopping center that wanted the business on there wanted another sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| That's not saying that one of the key attributes of the Planning Commission is they look at things holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| They're looking at using the provisions that Ms. Nolan mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| looking at the impact of a sign on the development as a whole as opposed to the Board of Zoning Appeals looking more on a lot-by-lot basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5951)|
| 1:39:19| Having said that, the Planning Commission did consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| Again, it was the same conundrum we had with the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| The Planning Commission felt that leaving the provision as it is in the new zoning code was appropriate and decided to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| I will forward the report to all the commissioners, Mr. Johnson, tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| And speaking of conundrums, you heard that the change we made to allow this provision to be enacted in all commercial districts was a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5978)|
| 1:39:52| If we had carried this provision forward to some zoning districts, it would have been a substantive change also then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| Again, we need some direction from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| The Planning Commission said they'd rather have this provision themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| At this point, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| I'm honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I don't care what you do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Just deal with the issues that are bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Ms. Malone talked about taking your time to deal with sign issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| Right now, there are a number of issues that you could be dealing with that have far more impact on this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| than whether the Planning Commission, a group of 15 very caring volunteers in this community, make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| or whether a board that's composed of five people you heard just earlier that sometimes they don't even all show up to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6031)|
| 1:40:40| So decide who should be empowered with this authority under clear standards for granting an additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| Who should be charged with that responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Who can best serve the interests of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| Gerald, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| I don't think these are substantive changes to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| We agreed not to make substantive changes to the sign ordinance, not to reopen the sign ordinance altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| And that meant looking at height and area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| That's what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| It didn't mean what we're looking at in these last two resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| That's taking it way outside of the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| We asked you and your staff and your commission to look at these issues and report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| And you're saying this helps us and we think this is the best tool for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| This is not a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| A substantive change would have been, in my mind, when we talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| and it's my interpretation and everybody's interpretation, but would have been height and area and placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| And that's not really what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| We're trying to give you, the planners and the Planning Commission, some authority to get this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| and get it done more expeditiously than bringing it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| And I think, you know, I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I mean, I don't support the resolution for those same very reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Mr. Green, can you tell us, just remind us what the process is now for these planned developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| and how signs are approved and contrast that with what the process will look like on January 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6124)|
| 1:42:12| Planned development, and Councilmember Roberto was right, when they submit their site plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| they go through a review process, and sometimes it's staff, sometimes it's the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| Signage is sometimes approved as part of that, often not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| They often don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| That's approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| If there is a request for an additional sign now, again, there's been one instance in four and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| the request is brought before the Planning Commission to the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| Planning staff reviews, makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| There's a notification to the surrounding property owners that consists of a sign on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| maybe more than one sign if there's more than one street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| postcards sent to the property owners within 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| It goes on our preliminary agenda on the website with just a placeholder heading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| naming the request on the final agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| There's a full agenda packet with plans and everything that's noticed in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| There's a public hearing held before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| If there's an appeal of that decision, the appeal comes to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| And under the process isn't changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| What does change, and Councilmember Roberto had it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| it goes from just the planned districts to all commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| And, again, that's a conundrum we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Where do we fit this provision that's in the existing code under the new code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| But the process is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| If there are additional signs requested, the process is not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| The process does not change for this additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| What does change is it goes from just the planned districts to all commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Because there are no planned districts in the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| The additional signs right now are handled as a variance through BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| If they are not in the planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| This provision is only applicable in the planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| So what we're doing is if we don't address it differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| we're saying instead of doing a BZA variance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| that it's now handled by the planning staff and heard by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| Is that the crux of the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| That's the crux of the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| The one issue is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| And it's a lot more places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| To be granted a variance, there has to be a showing of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| To be granted additional signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| the Planning Commission has to find that it does not detract from the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| but because of topography, placement of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| I forgot what the other provisions are, that additional signage is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| Isn't that the same thing as a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| No, I guess the easy answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| And, again, the Planning Commission probably looks more broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| How does this additional sign fit in in the development or in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| The BZA looks more narrowly at the lot and the hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| I'm going to make a statement that people might not like or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| but I just went through the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| or I'm going through the sign process with two businesses in my own building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| And my partner's comment was our building was turning into a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| because it's actually quite a lot of signage allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| when you also allow what's allowed in the windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| which is not disallowed by the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| So two different businesses and a lot of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| So it seems quite generous, as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| And, again, in four and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| I don't know how many requests for sign variances in the non-planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| But there's been one request for additional signage in the planned districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| in four and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| And even though there may be a few planned districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| there are a lot of businesses in those planned districts because of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| So if it's so frequent and far apart, it's very uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| Why do we need to make this substantive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| which some don't feel is substantive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| when it's being handled by the variance process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| And the question, again, the conundrum we had was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| we didn't want to make substantive changes to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| So if we took this provision, our choice was we take this provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| that allows the Planning Commission to make some decisions on additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| That's a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| We committed not how do we fit this provision in a new code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| that's different than our existing code without doing what we said we would not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| and that's making substantive changes to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| So, again, I don't care what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| Thank you for your blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| We've had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| How do we choose this provision and not make a separate change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6444)|
| 1:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| I do have to state, because I'm a staff to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| the Planning Commission reviewed this, and their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| and that's my personal and somewhat professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| that I don't think it matters a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| But the Planning Commission did state that they felt that they were the appropriate place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| to look for additional signage, and I do have to state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| Councilwoman Welch, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| I'm going to not support this moratorium, and I just wanted to sort of say why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| I think that, first of all, 120-day moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| there's a process in place for how to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| And so putting a 120-day moratorium, when we know that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| we've had one request in the plan development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| I don't see how this is going to be resolved in 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| and this basically stops business for some of our, whereas in the other case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| we had a clear path with the first moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| You have a clear path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| We've said, okay, there's an amendment coming, standards can be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| This, to me, is something that is, there's a process that will go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| it's a public process, if they want to request an additional sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| they have to go to Planning Commission, it's publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| This moratorium and what it's asking to do, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| feels like a substantive change to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| And so I'm not in support of the moratorium when I feel like we have a process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| to address the concerns that have been expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| You all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| I just, I don't see how it stops business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| Because in the meantime, if they need an additional sign, they file a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| Because all the moratorium is on is 13-9 letter whatever, 5E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6574)|
| 1:49:42| I can't keep up with all the letters, it's one line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| Because it's expanded the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| And I guess the other viewpoint is it didn't expand the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| because plan development went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| I'm trying to understand both sides to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| There is a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| If we pass the 120-day moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| it allows us to engage in the legislative process again to talk about what we want to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| The process would be exactly the same as is current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| which would be if you want a variance for your sign, you go through BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| This is a substantive change because it changes that pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| I think weighing whether or not it has an impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| it's the same process they're going through now unless they're in a planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| which there's very few of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| Again, I think this is very similar to the last discussion in the last moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6647)|
| 1:50:54| This area needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| We're talking about a very specific space of expanding additional available signs outside of planned commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6656)|
| 1:51:05| which I hazard to guess, and we have members from the sign task force here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| but if we were talking about that in the sign task force and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| well, we're going to allow additional signs up and down Kingston Pike and Broadway and Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| without going through this BZA process, I don't know that that would have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| So that's the substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| This is a very narrowly tailored moratorium, which, again, if we can correct this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| get a report back from planning commission, we can end the moratorium much faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| I don't think we need to make this a legislative process necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| It's gone through the committee that it's supposed to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| There are 15 people that that is what they are designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| It just seems like belaboring something that's already been taken care of to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| So I'm going to be going with the recommendation that Gerald has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| Let's call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I don't see any other lights on, so we will vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| So we have a motion and a second to approve the moratorium of 120 days on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6743)|

| 1:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6747)|

| 1:52:40| Councilman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| May the motion pass as five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| As we should have on the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| We should have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| I mean, it would only be appropriate to have a five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| Did you want to talk about Airbnb next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| Feral cats would really be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| I thought we were going to have to adjourn to swearing your successors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=6787)|

| 1:58:36| past 8 years, although not involved physically but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| certainly mentally and emotionally, I have lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| through pension reform, new sign ordinances, changes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7123)|
| 1:58:49| zoning, and recode to name but a few of the issues that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| council has deliberated on. I have waited while George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| answered emails, phone calls, attended ribbon cuttings, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| community meetings. I have traveled with him as he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| examined properties for zoning or rezoning changes. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| watched him sit for hours, read and consider items for a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| on upcoming agendas. He has juggled responsibilities of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| full-time job with council demands. He has come home at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| times, like tonight, physically and mentally tired from long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| and exhausting council meetings only to get up early and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| return to his full-time job. We have orchestrated get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7173)|

| 1:59:50| a sacrifice, not only for the one serving but also to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| family. And now with the conclusion of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| life returns to pre-council days. I am here tonight to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7199)|

| 2:00:29| felt was best for this city, and making the sacrifice from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| your families. I know from personal experience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| deliberations are difficult and divisive at times. You didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| let this cloud your respect for one another. Although there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| were conflicting opinions concerning some issues, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| exercised integrity and diplomacy as you deliberated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7246)|

| 2:01:04| funeral with you prior to you securing the vote that made you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| the mayor. You were lamenting some derogatory and unkind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| things that someone had said about you. You turned to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| with such transparency and sincerity on your face and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7275)|

| 2:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7325)|
| 2:02:15| I just want to respond to that. There's a special place in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7335)|

| 2:02:33| turn. I think I need Will or somebody to join me right out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| here in the middle. We do have a gift for you that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7358)|

| 2:03:45| you, Mike. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7425)|

| 2:03:57| you have encapsulated everything that I thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| wanting to say, but never really forming those thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7440)|

| 2:04:59| has been a joy to serve. I've really enjoyed it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7499)|

| 2:05:07| council and the mayor and you know one advantage is if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| get married while you're on council, they never know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| it's like off council. So Mark and I each had a child and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| doing our part to grow the city and really proud of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| we've accomplished the last 8 years and I think that's due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| the mayor's leadership, her great team council, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7526)|

| 2:05:35| I really feel good about the future of Knoxville. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| there's a good group coming in. I'm confident they'll do a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| job and to me, you know with our country so divided. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| really feel like cities and especially places like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| Knoxville. That's where great things can happen. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7547)|

| 2:06:18| Thank you Marshall. Are there other council members that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| to say something? You shamed us into it. I think no, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7581)|

| 2:07:06| debate that we can have. I think you first said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| reasonable people can disagree and I think we've done that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| I think we've done it really well and I think that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7635)|

| 2:07:23| hard at working well together and I think that's really what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| really what public service is about and and we've worked hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7647)|

| 2:08:00| Why are you handing me the mic George? Why why break a record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| of not speaking of her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| No, no, no. I always joke about sometimes, you know, just I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| want to dovetail off what my colleagues have said, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| and and speak and reiterate the same things over and over, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| I I do appreciate all the support on council over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| years and my colleagues in the past 2 years and 8 years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| you mayor for all your leadership and support. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| you've led the way on a lot of tough issues and we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| grateful for it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| One thing that is absolutely essential that a mayor do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| especially this mayor is find a consensus and you could tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| tonight that sometimes we were not totally in in sync with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| another and that's fine. But on the big issues you have managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| to build a consensus and that is absolutely essential and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| I thank you for that that that has been a delight serving with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| you and now you can have the last word. I get the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| Alright. Well, first, I want to thank all of you. It has truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| been an honor to serve as mayor for these past 8 years. I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| Lauren. I can't look at you. I'm going to start crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| It it's hard right all of these you can see just some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| things that y'all debated about tonight. It's hard. It's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| hard work and people feel very strongly on you know different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| sides of issues and that's what makes it so hard. It's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| through those and and and and having to do it week after week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| month after month, but it's truly been an honor to be in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| position like this because when we serve with your mayor on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| city council, you can actually see things happen. You know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| can we can look we can walk out the door. We can go to any part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| of town and we can see things that we all and and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| predecessors over the past years have worked on and and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| can't see that as much at the state level on the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| level right, but we see it right here. So it's such an honor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| do this. I want to say that the smartest thing that I did as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| mayor was to hire really good people you know in Bill Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| who's been with the city for 16 years. He's just got a wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| of information and and he's going to stay on for a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| months. He told the mayor elect that he he'd help with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| transition David Brace who stepped in a year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| ago 2 years 2 years now. Yeah. I've been with the city since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7824)|

| 2:10:32| knickers or something like since he was a kid and but has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| grown up with the city and it's really stepped into this role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| and did some really complex stuff with Tenova and and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| Science Museum and such so so many other things too. Avis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| Reed, who started as a member of the park board while she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| working at TVA and then retired from TVA and became the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| director of park and then moved up into the director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| community relations. I guess 4 years ago has done a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| job, not just with park, but with save our sons initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7866)|

| 2:11:13| Avis. Of course, our first woman police chief. She who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| again kind of grew up in the police department 27 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| 27 in January and and that's a tough job. You know having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| police department that is not easy because there's so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| I mean you have a really diverse workforce yourself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| and you also because we do community policing. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| lot of relationships with the community that need to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| and you're pulled in all directions and and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| really pleased over this last year. How well you've done with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7906)|

| 2:11:59| changed to where we're really focused that your staff, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| employees are really focused on professionalism and it shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| that through the accreditations and and the fine work that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| do. So Stan, you're a great leader in the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=7931)|

| 2:13:54| job. Erin Gill who started in sustainability and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| announced she's moving on up to the policy position and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| then where's Stephanie? Where'd she go? She's going to switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| roles and and now be head of economic and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| development. I'm sorry. I'm leaving people out but I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| Michelle and Jim. Oh, Don Michelle right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| Don Michelle Foster and Bob Letzel and then Don Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| When you look at all the redevelopment that has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| which has been huge in these past 8 years. Bob Letzel then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| Don Michelle and Ann Wallace and the team. Rick Emmett, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| whole team in redevelopment have been really critical and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| engineering. Every one of these projects that you all pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| engineering has a hand in it basically and Jim Hagerman's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| done a tremendous job over 8 years and pulling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| department together and getting a whole lot of varied things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| done and community development. Every department, Becky Wade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| and all of her team. Anyway, that is the key is to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| really good people and I have to say mayor-elect she I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| pretty proud except for those of us of those who are retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| She's basically kept on all the leadership and added some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| so I think that says a lot about the team that we have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| I'm very excited about the continuity and she'll do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| her way as she said and things will change and be reorganized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| some but that's the way it should be every 8 years. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| should shake it up a little I think but now let me talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| council. Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8123)|
| 2:15:30| Okay, right. So, so this is my chance to talk about council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| So, I want to thank all of the council members that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| served with these 8 years but because the others have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| left, I'm going to focus on y'all. Okay. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| Saunders, I think you've done a tremendous job these last 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| years as vice mayor. You've been a good friend and Ellen's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| out there. There she's another loyal spouse who deserves a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| special throne in heaven for putting up with this all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| years. Plus, you were on county commission too. So, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| that's a lot of work for a family but thank you. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| done a tremendous job. You've always had your heart in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| and it's and it's very obvious and everything that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| Marshall. So, you said you've you've got a baby and and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| on the way. Thanks for my spouse too. Yeah. Yeah, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| spouse. I mean, she married into it. We gotta question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| that but anyway but thank you. I mean, not only were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| building a young family but your work and then the heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| you put into this and a lot all the issues that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| raised particularly during the campaign, you know, appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| all that that you have done for the city as well. You added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| two more kids. We we like doubled our grandchildren. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| went from four to eight grandchildren during my 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| years but anyway, thank you so much. It's been a real joy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| work with you. Real focus on walkability, on downtown, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| bikes, you know, all a lot of really progressive issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| make cities places where people want to live particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| young people want to come and live in and businesses want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| move into because of that kind of progressive culture. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| thank you. And where else? George. So, George, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8226)|
| 2:17:13| impressed me early on and we did the pension, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| reform because you started on one side of an issue because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| you didn't have a pension and your workers didn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| pension but you listen to police and fire and general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| government and you really dug in and by the time we got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| where we were having the vote, you had you had evolved on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| issue and you talked about that and very early on, you earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| my respect really highly because of how many of us start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| on one side of an issue, right? And then as we learn more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| we evolve and we should evolve on that and there have been so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| many ways. You have a special heart for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| You had volunteered, served on the board of Knox Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Partnership, now HomeSource and anyway, I just love how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| careful we may not always agree on an issue but you certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| come, we agree on a lot of issues but you come so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| thoughtful of every issue that you deal with and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| obvious tonight as well. So, thank you. And Mark, you also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| grow in your family while you're here working, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| that's hard on on folks and you had a particular interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| the environment and our sustainability initiatives and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| we certainly appreciate that in the your career that was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| that line of work certainly brought a lot to our work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| the city as well. One, two, I got all four of them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| Yeah. So, anyway, sorry y'all it took so long but I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| whole lot to be thankful for and I say now that I'm kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| on this gratitude tour. You know, I go around to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| everybody because it really has been a tremendous opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| to work with all of you and the past councils and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| and I think we can be proud that we've got we didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| everything right. You know, I didn't get everything right but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| we but I think we did a lot right and I think overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| we're moving in the right direction and I'm so excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| about the future of Knoxville with the new leadership and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| with you all those of you who are still on council and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| that are coming on. So, I will stop now but thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| you. Thank you. Now, I believe before we adjourn, our attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8351)|
| 2:19:20| Rob Frost has some comments for the outgoing council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you too. You've been around a long time. Tell us how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| long you've been around. Sixteen years, I think and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| think I'm only second to Charles. Well, first, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| be, I want to thank obviously Mayor O'Hara but I'm here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| thanking the members of council that are departing I guess on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| Saturday. I'll get to welcome you all to the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| Alumni Club. There are no dues and if you request, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| Malone will keep you abreast of all developments. Whether you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| ask her or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| Will Savannah and Angela do a wonderful job serving City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| Council and serving the people of the city of Knoxville. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| have worked diligently and they've put something together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| for each of you four members departing. They deserve, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| three of them deserve the credit for this. I do not. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| simply here to hopefully say some nice things about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| Your name tags, they were not pilfered with malice. Thanks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8431)|
| 2:20:38| the council office. They have each put something very nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| together which you can hang at your home or on your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| walls. Mark, we will miss you. You've been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8448)|
| 2:20:55| environmentalist on council. You also have the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| follicles. It's amazing. You know, at one meeting you'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| clean shaven. The next meeting you're all in, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| grizzly Adams. I always like that you put thought into your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| decisions and oftentimes you'll get this wide-eyed look like, oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| my goodness, it's a big decision. And the constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| whether they're in Inskip or Fountain City or Oakwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| Lequin Park, they've appreciated your fairness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| your consideration over the years. Where did George go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| There's George. I've known Wallace and Wallace for a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| long time. I never really knew George until he got elected. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| remember in the mail getting one of his mailers. I mean, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| this letter that was like two or three pages, had an envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| in it. I'm like, oh my gosh, this costs a lot of money. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| was talking about all these things that the city really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| doesn't have a big say in. School systems, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| It's like, well, let's give this guy a chance. George, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| being beer board chair, we've really gotten to know each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| other pretty well. Beer is a four-letter word. It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8530)|
| 2:22:17| I'll miss most of those conversations, not all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| admittedly. I appreciate how George has taken a business-like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| approach to the things that come before council. Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| saw that tonight. How does the small business person look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191217?start=8552)|
