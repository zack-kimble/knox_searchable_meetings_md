| 0:01:02| Man, I didn't want you out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| I was just going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| They usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| This is a one-day permit, so I'm assuming it's a festival or something special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| So if you'd like, if you want to, you know, tell the audience a little bit about what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| going to be happening on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| It is an event that we hold annually for the benefit of cystic fibrosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| So far over the years, I think our total accomplishment is about $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=69)|

| 0:02:13| Dwayne Carleo, 117 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| And Art Jernigan, one of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| And what was the second name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Art Jernigan, J-E-R-N-I-G-A-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Mr. Carleo shows a conviction in 2002 for days and hours of retail sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| What kind of conviction is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| It's 4-32 days and hours of retail sale involving alcohol between either 3 and 5 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| or 3 and 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Time of day kind of restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=178)|
| 0:03:08| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you, Chairman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Lacking our counsel tonight, I'm a little concerned as to whether or not this conviction is germane to our approval of this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=191)|
| 0:03:20| Does anyone know if Mr. Swanson will be here later in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| and could we possibly postpone this agenda item to the end of the meeting in the case that he might arrive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| That would be a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| It would be a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| I know some of my colleagues would like to speak, so I don't want to cut off their debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| I know I spoke to, I got a message from Mr. Swanson earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| He was trying to catch people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| He'd been in mediation, and he expected to see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| So I expect he'll be here later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| So that's probably an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| I think that's the thing we ought to do, and I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| To the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| To the end of this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Would I be allowed to ask the applicant a question at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Well, sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| While we've got you up here, can I ask you the circumstances of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| It was a cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Yeah, I owned a pizzeria on a strip back in 2001, 2002, and that was a game day night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| and a guy walked in with a beer that I didn't even sell, and the cops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| because we were the only place open after 3 o'clock on a strip at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| You were just selling food and soft drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Yeah, I had a beer permit at the time, but the guy walked in with a beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| and since it was a pizzeria, I didn't even have a doorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| So that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| And what was the actual penalty for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| I'm sure I got fined, I think $500 or $1,500 at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Did you have any remedial steps like training or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| What did you have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Honestly, back then, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| It was just fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Yeah, it was just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| And you haven't had anything since that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| That's a pretty old event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| It is, but it still falls within the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| So there's a further discussion on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| The motion is to move Carlios to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| I'm seeing no other lights, and I'm assuming yours is an old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| All those in favor of that say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=314)|

| 0:05:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| We're going to hear from Central Convenience Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| We've got a man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| I just want to make sure, before you start, I just want to make sure that you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I mean, I think that we probably need to move to the rear of the agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| You all really trust me, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| No discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| So we're at, hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| What is his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| There's a question on his incorporation that we just want clarity on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| That's probably wise to wait on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| We'll call you at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| 721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| Well, on Crumbling Cove, the gentleman was here and he has gone to take care of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| business at City Court before he comes before this board tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Should we move to the end of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Which end is that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| The near end or the far end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Kind of the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Kind of the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| So any discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| If not, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| There is a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| No further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| No lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Crumbling Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| This is a very strange meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| We've done one so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Then we're going to go to the French Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Alan Tate, 3714 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| No discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you, thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| You're welcome, welcome, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| I'm going to go ahead and make another motion that we move losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| There are several questions or some questions there to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Chairman, with all due respect, since several of the owners, two of the owners, have not been in for processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| I might move that we even postpone this to the next regularly scheduled Beardmore meeting so that we could allow them to get in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| I would actually agree with Ms. Roddy, although if you think it's worth bringing it up later in the agenda, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| When I came to the meeting tonight, Ms. Wanda handed me their background information from Nashville Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| Oh, so we should roll this to the back of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| I didn't hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| You didn't make a formal motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I did not make a formal motion, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| And you made the motion to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| That's an old line, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| Marble City Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| And this is two, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| There's two separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I'm Jonathan Mercedes, Marble City Brewing, 708 East Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| On this particular permit, the previous owner's permit was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| So we would have to remove the prohibition on this property to enable them to move forward this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| Move that we do that, that we remove the prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Do I hear a second or is there a discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| We'll have to have a second to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| So there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Chairman Pavlis, I see that there are two permit requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| I guess one is to produce or whatever, manufacture, and one is to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Which one are we considering right now, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I guess I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Yeah, it's the one to serve, and then the manufacturing one is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| We've got a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| We've got a motion to second to remove the prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I just want to know what the past one was surrendered or what happened there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| and whether there's any relationship between this owner and the past one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| I can answer the question about the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| The company was out of business, but they had some unpaid taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| And the beer permit was revoked because they never paid those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| For my colleagues to know, this location is in an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| and most of you all know that I have a bit of a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| I usually have questions about service in an industrial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| because there's a little gray area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| but since this business also obviously is going to be doing a manufacturing piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| that seems to make a little more sense, so I'll back off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Jonathan, I wonder if you would take a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| and tell us about this exciting new brewery that Knoxville is going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| and we're going to get some custom beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| We're planning on doing a full distribution packaging brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| We'll brew hopefully up to 9,000 barrels a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| as we work up to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| distributing in both kegs and bottles to grocery stores and bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| We'll work through a distributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| And then for the retail side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| we plan on having just a tasting room where someone can come on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and try out what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Sort of like wineries do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| They have a tasting room and understand what the product is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Like wineries have where they'll have a tasting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| and you can sort of get a sample and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| I think we feel pretty comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Anheuser-Busch, they're all right with you all moving in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Oh, they're dead set on our targets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| Charles, just to kind of bring you up to speed on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| there was a prohibition on this property that we've made the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| and I think we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Have we voted on that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| No, we were just discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| We were discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| It was for unpaid taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| But it was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| So we went ahead and moved that prohibition on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| And we're to vote on that now unless there's further questions on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Now we'll go back to the original application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| So do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Subject to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| I see no last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| So all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| My next question is, since this was for the on-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| and then they have distribution as well, so do we have to remove that prohibition twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| No, it really actually only provides in the statute for the on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| If you want to do it twice, it would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| It won't hurt anything, but not absolutely legally necessary in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| So the other one is the not distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Manufacturers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Manufacturers permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| That's the other permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| I do not think that the year's prohibition applies to the manufacturer's permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| but if you want to wear suspenders and a belt, it won't hurt anything to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| I'll make the motion that the revocation suspension apply to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Well, it makes it a little cleaner for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Any discussion on removing the prohibition again on the same piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| just a different application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Which brings us back to the application itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Is there further discussion on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Seeing no lights, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Those like signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| It's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| Hometown brew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| Santa Fe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| By golly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| We got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| And I might report, Mr. Pavlis and Mr. Chairman, that what had happened apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| the lady that owned the premises was very, very ill with cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| She died somewhere in July, and the property fell into an estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and things just came unraveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| And so with a few phone calls, we were able to get people talking again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| and we have the applicant here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Well, I think that's great, and I think you spearheaded that effort, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| And we were about to give up on it, so obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| applicants here tonight were going to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| So if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| 2920 Ashby Highway, Ricardo Espinoza, Santa Fe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Going to be a restaurant, and we're trying to do it for, like, months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| And the lady just passed away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| and she stopped what she was supposed to be giving us, the way she gave us the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| So now I think the new person, they got the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| They called us to give it, like, 70, 45 to 70 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| and I think the day is going to be, like, three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| We're waiting on the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Mr. Espinoza, you were telling me earlier that in part this was because there were some repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| that had to be made to the building before you could actually start your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| and that's on the owner to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| That's what you were just telling us about that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| The building is supposed to be changed, the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| And when they finish the change of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I'm going to start fixing everything until I can pass the three inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| And so after that one, we're ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Any further discussion on this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Do you understand that means that you'll have to actually get those inspections done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Seeing no further last, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=995)|

| 0:17:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Why don't you tell us about your event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| We're having a First Friday event September 3rd, and it is a free concert on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| There will be two bands, a dance caller, and we hope dancers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| It starts about 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| 6 until 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| We wish you a lot of luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| And I take it that you have servers who will take whatever training is needed through the department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Seeing no further last, do we have a motion or a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Seeing no further last, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1069)|

| 0:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| That brings us back to Carly O's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Sergeant Hunter, if you will, we postpone, we move this to the rear of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| There was a question of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| A conviction of days and hours of retail sale in March of 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Before you came, he explained that someone came in, he said, with a beer, he was selling pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| And he was cited for that, for having a beer after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| But the conviction was for violation of the provision with regard to days and hour of retail sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| Is that what the conviction was for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| That's what the conviction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| But that's not what, I mean, we never sold a beer to this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| He carried it in with him, and he was drinking it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| And when the beer board showed up, they ticketed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| The problem is we can't go back and retry the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| What the beer board's responsibility is with regard to this is determine whether there have been convictions for offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| involving the sale distribution of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| And, unfortunately, days and hour of retail sale is one of those offenses that applies with regard to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| or not you are eligible to hold a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| And if you have a conviction for something of that sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| then you are not eligible for a permit for a period of ten years from and after the date of that conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| And so that really presents a problem in this case because we're only, it appears, eight years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| And so my suggestion, if the beer board would be interested in doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| would be to postpone this item on this occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Let you consult with counsel to see if there is some avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| I don't know at eight years down the road whether you're going to be able to do anything with this conviction or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| But so long as there is a conviction on the record within ten years for days and hours of retail sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| that person is not eligible for a beer permit in the city of Knoxville, frankly, in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I've had three beer permits since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Somebody wasn't paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| My tendency is to make a motion to postpone, to follow up on the advice of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| But I do see other lights, so I'll wait and see what people have to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| I agree, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| I was just going to say, I think what Mr. Swanson is saying is that if we would vote this down tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| or be forced to consider it, then there's, what, a one-year time clock before the permit can come back again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| with the payment of fees and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| So by giving you the opportunity to postpone and confer with your attorney and get some legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| at least you don't have to start all over and you don't have a one-year prohibition against reapplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| So I would certainly support a motion for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| There were issues in 2002 and 2004 about the building being overcapacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Could you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| I was part owner of Hannah's in the old city, and it was just, I'm sure it was in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| because that seems to be our busiest time back then, and it's just overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| And there's also a note about possible serving a minor in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| No, I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Perhaps I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| There's a note over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| It was originally listed on the initial application, but a corrected application was submitted yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| So that at least gives you the option, I guess, to go back and talk to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| to find out whether you want to press it, you know, or take some action in court to clarify the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| Last, Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| I'm sorry, were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Yes, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| You said on your form here served a minor in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| I'd missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| That's an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Do you want to --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| It's probably not wise to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| I didn't, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| I didn't find any record of that, whether it was city court or sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| Well, I will concede that ten years is an awfully long time for a conviction for days and hours of retail sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| But it's the state law, and we're bound by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| And so, absent a change in the state law, which, frankly, I have advocated in the past for that particular provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| I don't really think you all have an option beyond giving them an opportunity maybe to do something legally to fix the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| Last, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I'll go ahead and make a motion to postpone to our next regular scheduled beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| I was just going to ask you, what is the status of Carlio's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| We're almost there, but now we're going to miss football season, which is the busiest time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Well, you know, I would make or maybe ask this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| You know, the 21st is the next regular scheduled beer board, and they're going to miss, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| arguably probably some of the biggest crowds of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| So, I mean, I would be willing to hear it on, you know, our next regular scheduled right before council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| I will revise my motion to make it to a special beer board meeting on whatever the seventh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1410)|
| 0:23:41| It would be the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I'll do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So, I mean, that at least gives you the opportunity to go confer with your attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| or whatever it is you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| We're going to give you a chance there to maximize, you know, your opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| and particularly at the front end of the football season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| So, Councilman Bailey, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Yeah, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| I think this is a good suggestion to bring it up in the next couple of weeks, next scheduled council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| And if you've had beer permits, two or three beer permits between now and this, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| you probably ought to go back and consult with whoever helped you on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| and maybe come back to us and tell us what you found out and maybe we can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Well, okay, so there's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I think we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| If we don't, I'll give a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Then I see no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Opposed, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Come about 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Next up is Cumberland Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1507)|
| 0:25:19| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1519)|

| 0:25:30| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| I'm calling on a copy of the sales tax registration and approval for the building inspector, fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Sales tax I've got and we've had the fire suppression people out there doing work and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| So it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Just bring us the documents when you've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1555)|

| 0:26:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| The skin of your teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| Losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1578)|
| 0:26:30| You've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| My name is Steve Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I'm at 1931 Cumberland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Mr. Ford, Mr. Woolsey hadn't been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Tonight at the meeting I received their background checks and fingerprints from Nashville Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Still neither have been to the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I'm waiting on a copy of sales tax registration, corporate charter, certificate of zoning from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| approval from the building inspector and fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| And they submitted a change in ownership this afternoon that you'll find in the documentation we provided you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1628)|
| 0:27:17| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Does that change in ownership reflect the background checks, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| The only person who had been in for processing was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| And are we required to have every owner be on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| They removed an owner from the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| But they didn't add somebody new that we're not looking at here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I guess certainly the background checks are the most important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| but equally important is attendance at the task certification class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| particularly with a location on Cumberland Avenue where we have a significant population that is underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| It's certainly critical to me and my service as president of the Metropolitan Drug Commission that this be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| I think since we've already discussed having a special called beer board meeting in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| I'd like to make a motion to postpone to that time in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| and hope that you can take care of that in the interim and still get open in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| There's a motion to postpone until September the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| I see no further lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| You hear about 645 on the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| I might suggest that you check with these ladies before that meeting to make sure you've got all your paperwork in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| I might suggest you check with these ladies before that next meeting to make sure you've got all your paperwork in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| I've got everything and my manager is actually on that task force Thursday, this coming Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Oh, central convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Central convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1739)|
| 0:29:10| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Muhammad Murshad, 2240 Keith Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| We're waiting on surrender of the previous business tax permit or beer permit from the previous owner, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1763)|
| 0:29:33| And we had a concern about the charter provided with the application package because the documentation that was provided to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| indicates that that charter was, it's in the documentation we brought you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1781)|
| 0:29:52| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| We're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| That this charter was dissolved in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1795)|
| 0:30:06| Well, it's not uncommon for a corporate charter to be dissolved for failure to do the appropriate administrative procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| that are required on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| It's also not a huge problem to get it reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| But it should be, if we're doing it for a beer permit for this particular owner and the ownership is a corporate ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1818)|
| 0:30:30| we need to have a valid corporate charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So, again, I would probably recommend to you that you postpone this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| and allow them to do the necessary work to get their charter reinstated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| and bring a proof of that reinstatement to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| It doesn't take hardly any time at all to get that reinstatement done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| It usually can be done online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Mr. Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| I guess I will go ahead and say that since we're already having a special called beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| I will move postponing for two weeks and recommend that you get that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| Yes, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Do you understand that you'll have to contact the Secretary of State's office or go online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| and find out what the problem is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| It's probably you didn't file an annual report or pay fees and you need to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| My name is Gregory Clark and I'm here as an ex-best friend to Mr. Merschad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| The previous owner failed to file his annual reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and an application has been submitted for reinstatement of the current business name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| and that's what we're awaiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| So do you understand we're going to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| and that will get you a chance to get your paperwork in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| So if you'll be back here September the 7th at 645, we'll address that application again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| and hopefully you'll have all your paperwork in order at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| So is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Any questions from you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| There was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I just wonder, Mr. Chairman, do you think we ought to start a little earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Well, yeah, probably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| But I mean if they --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| We can maybe start with him at 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Yeah, why don't you come at 640?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| September 7th, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| On the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| 630?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| No, 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| It's going to be pro forma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| We did the whole thing in 25 minutes here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| It's not that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Well, the only reason I said that is if we have something that's contentious and we have some discussion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| at 7 o'clock we have to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| It's your call, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Well, these people who are returning have been advised what they need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Either they will have it or they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| So it shouldn't be a lengthy discussion that they have the materials they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Well, I have told the other one, 645, and I think it would probably lend us some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| I appreciate where you're going, Councilman Bailey, and you may end up being right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| but we could always take it up after the council meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| I hope I don't get bit on this, but, you know, I want to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| and hope that everybody will have their business in order there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| So have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| So seeing no further delays, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| All those in favor of the postponement say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| We'll see you then at 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Is there any further business to come before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| This is for Ms. Martin and Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| A gentleman contacted me by phone and hand-delivered a packet about Admiral Wine and Spirits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| and led me to believe that my item might be considered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Should I hold on to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Are they in consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| It's on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Oh, it's on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| It's 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| It's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| I got confused about this at our last beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Have we sunshined this for an agenda review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| Have we sunshined an agenda review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| That's fair then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Then we won't be doing an agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100824?start=2044)|
