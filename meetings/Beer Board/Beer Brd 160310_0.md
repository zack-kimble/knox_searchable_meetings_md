| 0:00:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=36)|

| 0:00:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=38)|

| 0:00:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=42)|

| 0:00:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| Thank you all for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| I think that we'll probably not take the amount of time I've put down on the agenda for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| because most of these are pretty cut and dried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| The purpose of this workshop, and what I would like us to leave with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| is a consensus on issues regarding the permitting process and requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| that we sometimes discuss when an applicant is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| when really we need to have a consistent procedure that we follow in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| We also have a question that has come up about the distance requirement for specific establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| And right now, according to, and it specifically states it in the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| and each of us has an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| And if you will open it to the first page, it's the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| In the second paragraph, it specifically states that on-premise permits require establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=101)|
| 0:01:49| to be a minimum distance of 300 feet from any church, school, daycare, hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=109)|
| 0:01:57| or funeral home measured building line to building line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| And if you have an off-premise permit, the requirement is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| I ask Mr. Frost to check, and the county also requires 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| We also know that sometimes applicants come to us, and they might be 278 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| or they might be 250 feet from one of these, and they then learn that they have to go to TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=137)|
| 0:02:27| If they get a permit from TABC, that overrides our permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| They can then have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| There is some cost involved in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| This 300 feet distance is one that has been in effect for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| and we've not had anybody question doing away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| By the way, that is Mr. Willett sitting out there from the new Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| and he's copiously taking notes on everything we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| And he is not accustomed to covering the beer board in Knox County or Knoxville City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| so we'll be nice to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Does he know we drink beer here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| No, he didn't ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| So anyway, getting back to this, the 300 distance requirement for specific establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| I know that Councilman Wallace has raised some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Do you want to explain your questions, your concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Well, I think time and time again we have applicants come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| and over the last four years I've seen them come up here, and then there's a distance dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| And so we say, there's the rules, has to be this, there's the distance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| and that distance requirement fails, and they look disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| And we come right back with, well, wait a minute, don't be disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Here's the loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Here's what you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| All you have to do is go there and file an ABC, and you can sell beer if you sell liquor and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| And it just seems to me that when you tell somebody the rule and then right behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| Council would have an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| If you fail the distance requirement, all you have to do is get your ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| And it just seems to me that it happens time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| We give them the remedy right when we give them the news that they meet the distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| and then they have to postpone it and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| And I think it's not just a small fee to get your ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| I think it's several thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| And, I mean, I would imagine that most of the concern would be about churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| I think today churches are in, that seems to be the one that comes up the most when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| so a church violates that, you know, violates the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Or a church is closer than where they want to put their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| More times than not, it's a church as opposed to a school or a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| That's been my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| And I think churches today are in shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Churches are in warehouse districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Churches are in old box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| They're not in your typical church in steeple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| And I think when you look at mixed use like downtown or mixed use in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| I mean, you begin to look at mixed use, you have churches and restaurants closer and closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| And I just think it's kind of an antiquated deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| and I'd like to see it bring it to a vote to see if that's something we'd want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| It has come to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| I didn't, I can't say that I thought of it on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Some people were trying to locate a business in the Happy Holler area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| and come to find out they had a piece of real estate under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| And then they got into the due diligence of the beer permit, and that's when this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| And that's kind of what brought it to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| And I said, yeah, well, time and time again, I see it come before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| and we offer what the rule is, and then we immediately throw down the trump card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| So I think just to keep it consistent, we ought to either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| at least our rules ought to reflect what the state rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| And that would be my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Yeah, I understand what Councilman Wallace is, you know, talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| Here's the thing that concerns me, is that, I mean, not getting in front of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| I mean, common sense tells me that we'll probably go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| we would need to reach out to each of the, what, funeral home, hospitals, daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| funeral homes, schools, and churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| I mean, we're going to need to reach out to these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| but I just can't imagine that we're not going to get a lot of pushback from changing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| And there is some justification why it matches state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| and I think they have to take a pretty significant bond out to get a state liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| I'm not real up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| So, you know, once we go and reach out to these groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| and I would, you know, feel really bad if we didn't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| it's going to be interesting to see, you know, where it goes from there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Well, I guess I start with the proposition of why do we have such a rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| and obviously those types of facilities, whether it's school, daycare, church, otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| you know, there's a certain amount of dignity and solemnness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| and you don't really want to have a wild and crazy bar next door with people hanging out on the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| and I realize that that might be the exception rather than the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| but I think there was the idea of some separation to avoid either conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| or unseemly conduct being that close to those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| So I hate to give it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I'm curious, maybe Mr. Frost can tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| does the state have any restriction on distance for a liquor license, an ABC liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| for any of these types of facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| No, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| I talked with a number of months ago, I talked with an attorney with the TABC, Joshua Stepp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| and he informed me that this was one of the few areas where the state hasn't come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| and dictated distance requirements and allows local governments to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| He told me there are some governments that have smaller distance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| but there are also some governments that have larger distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| On where this distance requirement came in to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| I mean, when I served on the beer board, we had this same discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| and Charles Swanson was asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| not only does this issue predate me, it predates Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| And if you look at the ordinance...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| But it's after the flood, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| It looks like this ordinance was on the books since 1962 and it was last modified in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| so I guess that modification did not have to do with the distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| because Charles was around then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Obviously, but Charles's understanding was that there was a distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| for those institutions established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| However, because there was no distance requirement for liquor, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| the thought was make a less intoxicating beverage available if someone's intending to drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=586)|
| 0:09:55| at least have a less intoxicating beverage like beer available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| versus they only could choose from liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Can we be stricter than the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=605)|
| 0:10:14| or do they override us just because they're the state and we're a little subsidiary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| The state basically has field preemption on liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| but local governments have some discretion on beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| So I guess if, for example, there was going to be a place, pick a school somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| that was going to go in and have a liquor permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| there would be no distance requirement for them to get a liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| But if the city did not have the TABC exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| if you wanted to drink, you could only drink liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| And Charles, what he relayed to the members of the beer board at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| was that it was his understanding that, well, there could be beer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| and if someone was going to have two drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| it was less intoxicating for them to have two beers versus two whiskeys, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=668)|
| 0:11:17| So he favored shorter distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| No, he didn't favor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| He was just relating what his understanding was that predated him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| why there was the TABC exemption or exception to the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| Okay, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| I read that my question has really pretty much already been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| I was going to ask about how long we'd have this on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| but you've already touched on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| There are some municipalities and counties that have 1,000 feet distance from these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| Going back to Councilman Wallace, I was just thinking, replaying the places that we've dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| Children's Hospital was one that came up in the fall of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| The Crafty Bastard on Emory Place next to Councilman and Vice Mayor Grieve's office came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| And I think there was one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| There's a place close to UT that changes hands pretty frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| but they've dealt with that now, so they're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| The one in Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| The one in Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Yeah, the Italian place in Homburg that was next to the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| I mean, it's a pretty big burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I don't know what the dollar is, the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| But to me, it's like, here's the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| but we're really giddy when we come back with the response and go, oh, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| but we've got the workaround, spend more thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| and put yourself subject to more rules and regulations over at the state and serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| And to me, I just don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| I just think the rule ought to be consistent with the state and we can reach out to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| So you would go for zero distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| I'd vote to make, if I were making a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| I'd make it to where it would be the same as the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Which is zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Which is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Councilman Starr, we haven't heard from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| I mean, I certainly agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| And I think it's basically the basic question is the current state of the law is if you want to do just beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| you have to be 300 feet away from these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| But if you want to do liquor and beer, you can be right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| And I think anybody looking at that would think that doesn't make any sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| And I think going forward, when we discuss this right now, it's difficult in the abstract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| But going forward, I think the Crafty Bastard is a great example of a growing local industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=829)|
| 0:13:59| There's a lot of microbrews, nanobrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| And I don't know their financial situation, but it is a burden on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| And you compact that with we're going to have more dense development, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| At least I would like to see more dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| So you're going to be running into this in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| So I think it makes sense to go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| And the reason is so clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| It really doesn't do anything because they can get a license and then sell liquor and beer right next to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| And I think it's important to note that downtown is exempt from this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| And I think, I mean, I'd like to see more dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| And it's obviously because of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| There's a lot of churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I don't know how many churches are downtown, but there's a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| And I think we want to encourage churches and we want to encourage businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| And density is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| I think most planners at MPC would tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| So we're going to be facing these more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| And, unfortunately, we don't have a big crowd of brewers out there urging us on to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| But I hope they'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Yeah, there's a couple aspects of this I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| The first was a question, do we have to honor the change when TBAC says okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=930)|
| 0:15:39| I mean, in other words, they say here's your liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Do we do that as a matter of comedy or are we forced to accept beer going along with the hard liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| That's the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Well, I'll make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| In other words, is it just a courtesy that we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| If the state will give you a liquor license, we'll give you a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Or can we say drink all the liquor you want, but you can't have no beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| You can do the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| You can't restrict the state in how they have created their distance requirements or lack of distance requirements in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=965)|
| 0:16:16| But you can amend the ordinance to take out the TABC exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| Okay, so that's within our power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| That remains within our power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| All right, well then the second part is I think the thing that Wallace raises that's most interesting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| if we're moving into a world of mixed uses and things being a lot closer together, how does that affect our decision making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=993)|
| 0:16:45| I don't know that I have an answer, but my guess is when this was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| churches were tall spired things with their own parking lots and facilities that were fairly separate and apart from adjoining uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| Probably, well of course it is from the boundary and not from the building, but even so, it was very demarcated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| And then when you get to the market square, and I understand we have a different rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| we've got storefront churches right next to other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| That makes it a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| I think I have to go with what Mr. Pavlis said, and that is shouldn't we invite them to weigh in if we're going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1039)|
| 0:17:30| This is a piece of public policy that I assume once they get the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and as long as there's no lapse of six months or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| a particular facility can keep selling beer even if the ownership changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| I wouldn't want to do this unless we were getting sort of a blessing from all these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| I think the worst case scenario is an elementary school or a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| I just think those two things don't mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| and I don't know that I've ever been to a pub where there wasn't someone a little bit maybe overindulged or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1082)|
| 0:18:12| or a little bit loud or a little bit maybe unruly, and I would worry about mixing those two uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| But I guess we should ask the players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Now, they had notice of this workshop, and I guess they could have come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| but I'm not sure who reads those notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| The tell by the audience is pretty light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Underwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| New Sentinel obviously reads them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Councilman Saunders, you've not weighed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Well, you did, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Well, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I agree with Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| You know, I think as we grow, and we are growing, thank goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| and we see things like we are considering down in Bearden, and we're encouraging density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| So this is going to change the equation in many ways, and I encourage that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| I think we've got to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| So when you look at the downtown, as Councilman Starr pointed out, this already exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| and there are a lot of churches downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| and there are facilities close by that serve alcohol in whatever form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| I also, like Councilman Pavlis and Councilman Dallavovia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| I would like to ask, at least make opportunity available for the churches, the daycares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| the schools, or whoever wants to come and opine on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| whether they want to do it over the Internet or come and speak to us in a forum like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| I'd like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| It's still our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Well, you know, you have All Souls Church uses the back of Cafe 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| And so, I mean, you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I mean, that's the church, the new church of today that shares a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| They're not having their own space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| They don't have their own parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| And yet they're selling liquor out in the front on the same day that they're having church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| So, I mean, it's not even, it's in the same building separated by a four-inch wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| It's not, I mean, it's just totally irrelevant, I think, in today's world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| But I think, I mean, I guess my question is to Frost to bring an ordinance if we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| and then that would bring on, it would get written in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| and that would bring out the public to, you know, to have a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Was that, I mean, is that the way we'd have to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Or how would, if we wanted to move this forward, how would we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| I guess that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| I have given a lot of thought to this because I knew that we would not have a clear-cut path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| It would be zigzagging all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| So, I think that one of the things we need to do is to reach out to all the constituencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| who would be affected by a change in the ordinance, whether it's a microbrewery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| whether it's a restaurant, bar, whether it's a daycare, whether it's a hospital, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| So what I'd like to do is to create a committee of three to organize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| and to reach out to these different entities and then report back to this group by September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| That gives you plenty of time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| And I'd like to ask Councilman Wallace, Councilman Stair, and Councilman Campin is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| but I'm going to ask him to do it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| That would be a suitable punishment for not showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| And Vice Mayor Grieve left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| How do you propose reaching out to the thousands of churches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| Well, there's a minister's association, there's a list of churches, there's a list of synagogues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| there's a list of mosques, there's a list of hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| The school board would, I'm sure, be happy to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Certainly the county attorney would be happy to weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| So there are a number of things that the three of you get together, figure out a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| and then if we need to have a large public meeting, if you want to meet with the groups individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| that would be the call of the committee to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| But that way everybody has ample notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| We don't show up in two weeks with an ordinance that we're going to have zero distance between a beer-selling establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| and a nursery, a church, a hospital, a daycare, a funeral home, a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1345)|
| 0:22:35| I think that the public reaction to this will be about as probably as mixed as we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| But I think that if we don't reach out to the affected constituencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| and this includes the micro-brewers and others, if we don't get input from those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| we will be opening a can of worms that will far surpass some of the other cans we've opened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1375)|
| 0:23:04| And some of us have been around long enough to have looked into those cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I guess I'm a little hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| I mean, I certainly want everybody that has an opinion about this to contact us and have their opinions heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| But, I mean, sort of I guess my difficulty with it, if they're very frustrated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1401)|
| 0:23:31| then, I mean, they must know that someone could serve liquor right next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| Zero feet for liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| So, I mean, I just don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| I mean, I think you will have a lot of upset businesses, and we're reducing the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| But I think if they really understood, well, the situation we have now is we just tell them to get a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| so they're selling beer and liquor right next to your church, right next to your nursery or daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| you know, right next to your hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| And that's the current state of the law now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| So I think that's, you know, I think it's – so I just have difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1450)|
| 0:24:19| It seems like we're trying to drum up opposition when the reality is that's the current state of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| I understand your reluctance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| But I also know what happens when constituencies are not included in major changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| As we all know, change is a really frightening thing for a lot of different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| And I think if they're not included that this will come back to really haunt the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Yeah, I was just wondering what sister cities of our size, the Nashvilles and Chattanoogas and Bristols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| and Memphises are doing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Is this, as someone has alluded, a vestige from the 60s that no longer pertains in the other cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| Or is this fairly standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| You know, the one thing we haven't talked about, should 300 feet be 200 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| But at that point you're quibbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I don't know, but you could change the distance and remove some of the obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| I don't mind trying to look online some other time what, you know, the major cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| I mean, you know, this is something that's been on the books for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| And, you know, like I said, I engaged in this very same discussion 10, 12, 14 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| So it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Of course it's clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| So that wasn't the age before Crafty Bastard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Okay, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Well, I hope if we do this it does not become as long as the sign-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| You couldn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Just couldn't resist the temptation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| If that be the case, I will hope we not do it until 2018 when I'm gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| That's why I said that that committee would sunset in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| so that it would give them some time but it wouldn't go on eternally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| or at least not until after our terms are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| I was just going to say I hope we have, you know, a sensible policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And a lot of these laws were put into place, you know, so many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| We didn't have legal liquor sales at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| We didn't have liquor stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Some of the laws are antiquated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| But we certainly have to think about, as Della Volpe mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| the schools and daycares and what's next to what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| But the law is sort of antiquated in terms of what we're allowing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1614)|
| 0:27:03| That's my little two cents on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Well, I don't accept the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I mean, I think that's putting a task on us to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| and do something that's inconceivable and impractical to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| as a way to kill that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| I think, you know, what we can do, it can die and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| or we can just simply bring an ordinance and bring it to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| and let it see if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| If it doesn't pass, it doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| But I think to put that kind of request on us is totally impractical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| and it's just a way to kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| And if you want to speak against it, just speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And I have no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| It doesn't benefit me one way or another, but it's an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and it's something that is what I said is true and it's repeated itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| I'd say, at least a dozen times or more over the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| and we only meet once a month, so it happens fairly regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| and it's just a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| We don't want to do it, and we simply just make a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| just like we've done in the past, we take a straw poll vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| and if it's down, it's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| If it's up, it's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| But our option is just to bring it as an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| and then vote it up or down at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| But to put together some type of, go out and talk to all the churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I mean, that's really impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Only the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| It was hospitals, other groups that were affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I don't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| But if you don't want to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| That's just fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Do we want to have a straw vote to see if we want an ordinance for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| No, I just, I think, I mean, as council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| we all have the right to bring an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I think we should just, if one of us wants to bring it, we bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and vote then because we're missing two members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I don't think it makes sense to take a vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| We've discussed it for 20 minutes, and I don't have anything else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| So if somebody wants to bring an ordinance, bring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| and we'll see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| The next item on this is the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| There are two items that always come up at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| One, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Can I just, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| I would assume that they have, well, you've got school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| so that covers the schools, and I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and Mr. Frost, in your spare time, if somebody's spare time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| I mean, we need to look and see if there's an association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| that would be comprehensive to the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| I mean, there's got to be some type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So, I mean, if we send them a letter and just, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| but I'm not going to do this without their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| I mean, they have to be notified that this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| I mean, transparency with something like this, we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| It will be devastating to this council, I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| People will be very angry with us, and they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| So, at a minimum, I understand we don't want to do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| the committee work or, you know, do what was suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| but let's please at least send notification to the proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| the people who are, you know, who are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| If we bring it as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| I mean, if we bring it as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Otherwise, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| There's no need to make any, I mean, if we're not going to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| I mean, that's only if we were going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Well, I've got a feeling an ordinance is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Well, if an ordinance comes, we'll address it at the time the ordinance comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| and that could include postponing it for public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Okay, fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I just want to make sure that we're transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| But I think that we need, and I'm not just talking about the groups that are listed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| but I'm talking about people who sell, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Yeah, comprehensive, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Sometimes one of my pet peeves is that we only hear from one side of an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| and I think this is a multi-sided piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Okay, now let's move on to the next two items, the task class and the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| If you will look at the first paragraph of the application for a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| it's on the back of the page that says you have to do this on legal paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| In the first paragraph, underlined and bolded, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| after application and payment are received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| all owners and managers must go to the police department for record checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| fingerprints, and photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| The beer board won't consider applications without record checks on all applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| But as you go through this, it points out that you need to take the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| but it doesn't require that you do that before you come to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So we could continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Prior to the issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| So we can, on the task class, approve pending completion of the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| or final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| And then on the records check, though, I have heard from finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| and Donna and Wanda, do you want to speak to if this comes back from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| and somebody has an issue on their record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| then the beer board is the one who has to make the final decision, not finance or business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| Do you all want to talk about what would happen or what you see, the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Specifically, if it's a box check, if it's something to say, yes, they completed the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| no, they did not, that's a simple decision for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| But we are not in a position and would never consider ourselves in a position to make a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| That's what we refer all information to the board to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| You won't hear from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I mean, if it's just to say, yes, they got a records check or no, they didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| then that would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| But to then review the record and determine is there something on that record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| that they should preclude them from getting it or not, I'm not comfortable for my staff to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1979)|
| 0:33:08| I think it circumvents the board, and it certainly puts us in a position where we are not prepared to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| shouldn't ever fall on, there's no public, it's not in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| It would be her decision or my decision, and that's certainly not something we're comfortable doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| Again, I've stated to you multiple times, we will act in the manner that the board wants us to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| and we will support the board in whatever manner you all ask us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| We will strive to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| But we are not interested, if at all possible, in making any kind of judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| I think it puts us past what our role is in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Yeah, I mean, you know, you have to ask yourself the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| why are these beer permit applications coming to us at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| And if we're not going to insist that we have people who don't have dangerous or questionable criminal background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2040)|
| 0:34:10| or don't have the foresight to take the class to tell them how to serve and how to avoid serving minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2050)|
| 0:34:20| I mean, that's the core of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Other than that, we're just a rubber stamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I mean, you know, we have a box that says you have to get the health department to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| and the fire department and all those safety standards that you have to touch the base on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| I don't see why that's too onerous for someone who wants to open a facility that serves liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| and puts either minors at risk or, you know, encourages some kind of criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| I just think I'd rather have a hard and fast rule that you've got to do that before you get your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and if you haven't taken time to do it, we're sorry, but come back next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| or we'll have a special meeting if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Other than that, I don't know what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I mean, the staff does the legwork on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| The police department really scrutinizes their criminal background or record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| to see if they're fit and don't have some either fraudulent or criminal behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| I mean, I think those are two things that, what, impress upon the mind of the person applying for the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| that this is a serious thing and we have to take it serious in our own operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| So I just assume we send them home if they haven't done either of those two things until they've gotten them done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| In preparing for the workshop, I talked to Allison Dyer in the law department about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| because, you know, one thing when you have the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| I always try to find out, well, if you change a policy or change an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| are you unintentionally pulling strings with other people and having unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| She, like I, you know, don't make policy decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| but she thought that because the task class is a simple yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| that if you're going to make something subject to final documentation and it's the task class, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| But she was of the opinion not to do the same thing with the background and records check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| kind of as those ladies discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Yeah, I agree with that, and obviously we've batted this around numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| and I'm fine with the task class being a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| I think the records is subjective where everything else is black and white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| and everything else is a box checked or unchecked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| and either an inspection's been done or it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| That's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| The records check is subjective to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Do we accept it or not under any conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| So I think the responsibility is on these people getting this license, as Nick said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| and I totally agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I mean, it's their responsibility to get this work done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| and get it done in a timely manner and communicate with this board when it hasn't been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| and if they can't do that, then I question whether they have the fortitude to really run a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| and pay all the taxes and the legalities that they're forced to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| So I don't mind changing the task class to yes or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| and let that be subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| but I think we stick to where we are and for the reasons that have been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Well, I thought I was going to get squashed on both of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| but it sounds like the people are at least open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| And the reason why I put them on the agenda is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| and I certainly respect people's different opinions on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| is sort of what do we really achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Because it seemed for when I first was on your board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| we would pass and generally pass everything pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| and then we changed it, and the impetus was that it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| I thought the impetus was it would somehow reduce sales to underage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and I just don't, I mean, frankly, I just don't buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| whether they complete the task class before they're before us or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| And the reason why I would ask for the change is just the number of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| I mean, these are small business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| A lot of times they're nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| The wrong person is before us, and there's some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| Somebody didn't take the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| They thought they'd already taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| There's just been a number of examples, and it really puts us in a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| We've really put ourselves in a bind a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| and then we've had special meetings to accommodate people, make them come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| We bend over backwards because I think we empathize with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| We've all missed a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| We've all messed up an application, and we don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| and I'm afraid sooner or later there's going to be an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| and we're not going to be able to have a special meeting to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| and then it could have changed their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| So that's why I put these on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| In terms of the records check, I certainly understand that's a discretionary call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| I mean, it would be possible that if there was nothing found in the background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| then that box would be checked, but if it was anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| then it would have to come back to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Would people be open to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| I think that would be inconsistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| and, again, it would be putting a burden on the other department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| I mean, the task class, either you've done it or you haven't done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| but with the records check, when you get this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| one of the very first things it says in bold letters, underlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| is that you need to get that records check done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| So if you are a business, and particularly if you're going to be selling alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| you need to get all of your ducks lined up, and that's part of the ducks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| One of the things that has concerned me as the chair is that we need to be consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| and if we know somebody or like somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| we're able maybe or more inclined to take a different path than if we don't know somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2434)|
| 0:40:43| And I think that we need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| At some point that's arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| And I think that we need to be consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and I would hope that we could get consensus that the task class is a box that's checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| so that can be approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| The records check, we're still discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Well, I guess my question is, when the record check comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| does it sometimes appear that they found nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| Sergeant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Some applicants don't have any criminal background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Some do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Sometimes there's a question as to whether it's applicable and would keep them from a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| In terms of what percentage have no history, would you guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2484)|
| 0:41:35| Just guessing, I'd say it would be a small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Most applicants have at least something through traffic court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Okay, well, in that case, then it probably does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| I just wasn't aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| I thought maybe, you know, if you had a totally clean record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| then that could be like a box that's checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Councilman Pavlis, you've been very patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Yeah, well, I mean, I think it's good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| I kind of tend to go with Councilman Starr a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| I mean, it's kind of like that Turbo Tax commercial they run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| It's pretty cute where they bring all these scientists in and it says zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| I mean, if there's nothing there, then there's not a decision to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| But I don't think that this council is going to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| But I do agree that I think if the task class could be one that I would be fine with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| you know, if they completed it before we met again a month later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| then I would be totally fine with moving forward with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| allowing them the opportunity to correct that situation before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| So let me make sure that I understand what we have come to some agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| except Councilman Saunders, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Very simply, I was going to say yes or no on the task class, do the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| That's a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| You've stated it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| We've come to consensus and agree that we will not be rehashing this in front of applicants at the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| Councilman De La Vope, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| I understand that the box is either checked or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| and they don't get the permit from the front office without the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I still wonder whether that notion that they're going to ask about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| that they're fussy about someone who's served minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| and that's the number one reason you come back before this board if you've already got a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| that it isn't important to insist that they jump through the hoops before they get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| And I understand that no one's saying that they won't jump through the hoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| We're just saying pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| But, you know, when you walk into a courtroom or a church, there's always this big elevated thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| and you're coming before the authority for permission or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| And I think there's something to be said about being a little puckered when you walk in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| that you've done all the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| And I think that moral suasion that that encompasses is worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| Otherwise, there's really no reason for this board to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| This board does not sit and actually hear the hearing cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| We go to a hearing officer and let them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| So the number one reason we see them when they come back here is they've stepped across the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| Someone glances at the license and can't count to 21 for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| But I think it's important to impress upon them how important that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| And the task force is where they learn some of those techniques and some of those obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Why not make them have a little quaking in their knees when they come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| to see if they have done the right things to be qualified to serve beer in this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| I realize we're trying to encourage businesses, but we're not trying to encourage irresponsible ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| So I wonder if we make it so simple that no one pays attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| If you'll turn to the back of this sheet, this is the letter that goes with the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| and it talks about the records check and when you can get them, and it talks about the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| And so most people, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, sign up for the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| and they get the records check done at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| There are a few occasions that might not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| such as if they don't have the appropriate identification with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| But most people who come to the task class also do the records check, so that's not really a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| And that's part of what this encourages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Madam Chair, I just wanted to say whatever – you mentioned consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Whatever we decide to do as a board, I hope that we are consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| I know that we've tried to be helpful to people because these people are opening businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| and we don't want to – we're trying to encourage, especially restaurants and other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| But whatever we do, I think we definitely need to be consistent in how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| So, yes, it's just that they have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I think that – so if they had got here, they'd had the background check and not taken the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| then we could approve it subject to final documentation, just like the plumbing inspection and anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| I think one of the other things that's come up is that, well, I had my fingerprints done somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| Remember that case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| And that guy said, well, I had it done in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| And he was like, no, it had to be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| So I don't know if that needs to be spelled out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Maybe it is clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| But that was another issue we got into on the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| He was like, no, it's got to be – we weren't trying to be – you know, but that was the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| So, you know, that was – anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| I was just going to say that as far as I know, business tax explains that to them when they pick up the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| And when they call us, we tell them the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| We get a lot of questions, especially if they're from – if the owners are from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| If they appoint, I guess, a local manager to come to the task class, then what do they do as far as their background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| So we give them the instruction on how to go about getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| So everybody's okay with task class pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| And you have to come back to us if you don't have your records checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Now, the next item is the ID check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| And this was something that Councilman Pruitt brought up because somebody who owned a restaurant wanted us to have an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| if I'm correct, that would require IDs to be checked before anybody could be served alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| To be more specific, wine or liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| I talked with Joshua Stepp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| He's an attorney with TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| You all might recognize his name because he's often the one signing the pleadings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| when people are getting their liquor licenses suspended for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| The concept is called universal carding where you card everyone for everything dealing with alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| whether it's beer, liquor, or wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| Attorney Stepp informed me that because the state of Tennessee so heavily regulates liquor and wine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2907)|
| 0:48:37| that local governments are not capable of passing an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| where local governments could require restaurants to card a patron before the sale of liquor or wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| Councilmembers Stair and DellaVope probably would recognize the term field preemption, is what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| where the state has so pervasively regulated a field that no other local government can come in and tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2941)|
| 0:49:14| So that's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| It's not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| It's not a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| It's not even an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Why is it on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Well, someone brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| They wanted to talk about it, and then he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Maybe he got scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| But we splained him to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| These were anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Okay, the next one is the special events timeframe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| and this is something that has come up in the past with the Greek Festival, and there are some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| Mr. Frost, former Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| Well, you know, we'll have on occasion a request from some nonprofits that want to have a couple of events per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| I can make minor changes to that ordinance if the members of the beer board would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| or at least five members of the beer board would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| to allow the applicants to have two different events, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3009)|
| 0:50:20| Two different events under one permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Yeah, two different events in one year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| They're limited right now to one event that can last up to three days in a 12-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| and we could real easily change it where they could have up to two three-day events in one 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| Twelve months on the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Well, the ordinance says 12 months, so I take it that that can be a rolling 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| So one permit, you can have one event, but the most can be a three-day event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| That's what the ordinance presently is, and this would allow two events, two three-day events in a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| In a schoolyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| For the same organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Okay, but I want clarity on, I mean, I'm fine with doing this, but I think let's just have them come here one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3067)|
| 0:51:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Oh, no, they still have to come one time, but they can get two for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| Or, you know, they can come one time and they can come back at a later time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| because they hadn't planned the second event or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| And that has happened to a couple of organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| All right, is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Do I have some direction from the members of the Beer Board to prepare that ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| That sounds okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Yes, I would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Especially I've seen fundraisers where they're trying to stage them, like, you know, a month apart or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| and have some opportunity to meet their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| All right, is there any other business that the Beer Board needs to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| Good job, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| We're all still alive and speaking, so this has been a successful meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160310?start=3124)|
