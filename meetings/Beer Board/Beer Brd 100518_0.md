| 0:01:57| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=117)|

| 0:02:06| Questions on the motion? If not, all those in favor, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Opposed, no. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Rocky's Place, 1482 Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| My name is Roger Ayer, 6107 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| Officer Freer. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| In reviewing this packet, I noted that this particular location is in an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| It's zoned I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| And I realize there is a preexisting beer permit there that's going to be spreading their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| But could you review with us how we should handle applications for a permit in an industrial zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Among the permitted uses in I-3 zones and most of the industrial zones is included language which says a retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| which would be, this is a retail use, a retail or service use only when it directly serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| or is auxiliary to the needs of the industrial plants or employees thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| The Beer Board has been considering beer permits issued in industrially zoned areas ever since I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| And on all of those occasions where it's come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| the Beer Board has concluded that this is a retail use that is directly serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| or is auxiliary to the needs of the industrial plants or the employees thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| That is something that I guess is open to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| But that's what you have decided in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| And to decide otherwise with regard to any particular establishment would certainly create an issue as to equal protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| I would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I'm not finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| So I understand in this particular situation they're not really grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| but there's certainly a precedent in terms of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| We talk a lot about precedents on this council when we consider zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| and other things outside of Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Is this a situation where if we had a new permit, not this one, but a new industrial location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| would you feel that the council could consider that application on the merits of its applicability to the industrial needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| of the surrounding manufacturing companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Or have we set such a precedent in industrial zones forever and ever that this can never be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Certainly the council could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| But I would have to say that the ensuing litigation arising out of a denial of a beer permit under those circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=282)|
| 0:04:51| if you show a pattern where you have said that in each and every instance the Beer Board has considered a retail use such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| to be directly in service to or auxiliary to the needs of the industrial plant or its employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| if you say that invariably time after time after time after time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| that's certainly something the court would consider if all of a sudden the Beer Board were to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| no, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Do I know what the outcome of that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Would the court uphold that as a decision that you could make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| I don't know the answer to that, but I certainly would not wish to assure you that it certainly would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| And I guess ultimately what I'm uncomfortable with is the language because it obviously is one case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| where there's some interpretation allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| And the way the language is stated that the beer is auxiliary to the needs of the surrounding zone or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=339)|
| 0:05:47| just I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Changing that is not, what does it require to change that if we were to consider amending that at some point in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| Change in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Councilman Del Valle, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| No, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I think Ms. Roddy asked the question I was going to ask Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| that this could then be changed by asking MPC to consider, look at this and then limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| and we could broaden that to limit service and retail uses in the industrial park zone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| I mean, we could ask them to do something more broadly than just to avoid retail, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Yes, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| We've probably made him nervous enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| This is a broader issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Okay, and I will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Any further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=414)|

| 0:08:13| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=493)|

| 0:08:28| Linda Billman, 301 South Gay Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| Officer Frills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Yes, I just wanted to ask Ms. Billman while she's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| have you considered holding a bluegrass festival in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Perhaps we could make Chilhowee Park and the World's Fair Park available as venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| and even the Market Square Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| We'd love to see WDVX thinking about something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| We're happy with Bob Dylan, don't get me wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| but it would be nice to have a three- or four-day bluegrass festival, a regional festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| We did Camperfest a number of years ago in another county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| and we had to get back on our feet before we could really do an extended bluegrass show like that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| But it's not dead by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| We're going to still talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| But, yeah, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| World's Fair Park or Chilhowee Park would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Would you be willing to sit down with Gloria Ray or Ashley Capps or someone like that and talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Definitely, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| There's no relationship to your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| You were here and it was just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Well, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| You're the world's finest bluegrass station and most popular bluegrass station as a result of the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| You certainly could get the word out, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Well, we'd like to revisit that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Thanks for the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| That's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| I was just curious, what are you planning for the birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| What are we planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| There'll be 11 bands, local bands, that are playing Bob Dylan tunes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| And, well, we've got this little Bob Dylan face that people will hold up in front of them so they can take a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| And there'll be some good food, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I guess I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| You will have your people trained to dispense beer and do all the steps that are needed to do that, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| We have regular volunteers who do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Seeing no more lines, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| I haven't seen anyone come in, but I'll call Santa Fe one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| And not having seen nobody come up, I'll make the motion that we move this to the next regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| I was going to bring up two other things before the end of the agenda that actually have to do with the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| So you should go ahead and do that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| We'll move this to the next regularly scheduled beer board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| We had decided we wanted to do a gender review, which is just a chance for people to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| is there anything they know of on today's agenda that they want to let folks know of early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| So I want to just do a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Anybody have any agenda review items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Seeing Mr. Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| I was just going to ask you, with regard to the capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| is that like the other budget where we're approving it on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| and then taking that up at the hearings that are coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| It's a pro forma approach at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I would say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| As opposed to the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| I'm going to talk about budget hearings during the reports of council during the meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| I wanted to go over for new folks sort of what I'm hoping happens with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| I've got copies of the agenda for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Second thing I wanted to do here, since we do have a little more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| is just to go over the workshop next Thursday on development tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| Emailed a draft agenda to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Got responses actually from most of the council, which I really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| It's going to be pretty much what was in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| overview of how we do development, overview of what the chamber does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| and then a few tools going into a little more detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| As it gets more fleshed out and I figure out who's doing what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| we might be parsing that down a little bit because right now it does look kind of long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| But I wanted to let folks know it is largely the agenda that I emailed you a week or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| If I could ask, please do, follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Is that 5 p.m. Thursday the 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I wanted to find out, Cindy just faxed us something right before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Could you kind of review that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| What responsibility do we have with what you just sent us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Basically what I sent you was for information purposes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| There will be a suspension revocation hearing on Wednesday of next week at 1.30 in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| I believe it's for Magnolia Minimart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| They are still trying to settle that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| or at least come to an agreement with our city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| That has not happened at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| So we are scheduling the hearing for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| But you're not expected to be there or needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| No, it's before a hearing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| But you're welcome to sit down if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| I left that part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| It's open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| We have no responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100518?start=845)|
