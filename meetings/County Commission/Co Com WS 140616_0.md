| 0:00:09| Commissioner Rotten, do you mind to lead us in the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=9)|
| 0:00:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=14)|
| 0:00:15| I ask that everyone stand and please give proper courtesy to our country's flag and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=15)|
| 0:00:19| join in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=22)|
| 0:00:29| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=29)|
| 0:00:43| I'm going to go ahead and take amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| If you guys have got a packet that was passed out to you in reference to Resolution 803| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=46)|
| 0:00:53| from the Finance Department, I'd ask that that be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| It's in reference to the Wildlife Refuge Property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| Is there any other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| I'm going to postpone 48 one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| I just haven't had an opportunity to get together with Dwight and Cindy on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=75)|
| 0:01:25| Any other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| I'm going to go ahead and I sent an email earlier today in regards to the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| Everything is on consent except for 6, 7, and 49 as a proposed consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| Is there any items that folks would like to be taken off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| I have a question on 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=112)|
| 0:02:02| Okay, we'll add 12 to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Yeah, I don't want to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| I would like to ask that the discussion item of the PPU be moved to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Well, one of these resolutions is about the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| I forget which one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| It's the discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| There's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| I don't know if there's an audit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Oh, it's the resolution that the Audit Committee requested for outside for Pew and Company to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| entry-exit audits on the new offices in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| At some point in time here, the Audit Committee members, we probably need to relay a little bit of information from the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=163)|
| 0:02:54| So we can do it at that discussion item then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| We're going to move it to the front so Andrew can get back to work too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| And then on item number 53, that's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=185)|
| 0:03:17| And I'm going to ask that when we get to it, I guess we need to take it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| So I'm going to ask that it be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=200)|
| 0:03:32| Any additions to the agenda or subtractions from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Motion is to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| What needs to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| What needs to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| I need approval for the minutes from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| Yeah, we're going to move up the discussion item for audit, if you guys don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| With no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| On page 16, item number 57 is update from the Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| regarding the Knox County Schools PPU account audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| Commissioner Wombley, go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| I appreciate the conversation the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| The reason I wanted to, and it was from your suggestion to put this on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| to kind of, because some weren't able to make the audit committee on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| I was here but had to leave because of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| But I just wanted you to be able to kind of give us a status update where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| I know you can't go into details and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| but at least know when we can kind of expect it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| because it was kind of put out there that August 8th was when it would finally be released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| and that's actually the next audit committee meeting date, not when it will be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| So I just want to give you an opportunity to kind of address us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| and let us know if we have any questions we can kind of get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Yes, I think, based on our conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| there seems to be a misconception that our office is going to hold a report until the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| to be released and final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| That may be the time we discuss it, and unless you all tell me otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| I wasn't planning on holding a report for two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| until an audit committee meeting would be convened so that we could discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| I think that would make it less valuable to the people receiving the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| to go ahead and put their actions in place and start working on whatever recommendations we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| And at the audit committee, we talked about the PPU audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| and we're working a little slower than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Part of that is because I wanted to make sure our processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| and our policies and procedures were following the Yellow Book completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| and we had to do a little revision to make sure those were all in place and I was comfortable with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| We had to do a little training with our staff to get them comfortable with where I want our staff to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And we had to do some additional background work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| I'm not familiar with some of the systems that are involved in the school's finance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| and I want to make sure that we understand the controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| and everything that goes in around them, around this entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| before we start doing massive testing on information that we're kind of foggy on, or at least I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| So I wanted to make sure we had a really good plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| that we had done a lot of background research so that we knew exactly what we were testing against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| So that's kind of where we are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I'm hoping that we'll have a draft in the next, probably by mid-July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| and then based on how long it takes with the schools to work out a final response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| then we will issue it in final once we receive their response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| We won't be discussing any preliminary results, so we're not going to release a draft report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| Once it's final and they have their decision made on what the audit results are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| then we'll issue it to the Audit Committee and Commission and we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| But before, when it goes out in draft, it's pre-decisional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| They haven't had a chance to evaluate the audit report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| and any additional discussion may take away from them actually being able to put their plans in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| and respond to the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| So that's the process that I was hoping to put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| So unless any of you all object, that's where I was going to go forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| I know, appreciate that, and that's exactly what you said to me last week, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| How long do you suspect that the response would be from the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Seven days, ten days? Do we give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I don't want it drawn out another month is what I'm saying, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| No. I'm hoping that we can get it turned around pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| My philosophy on auditors, there are not going to be any surprises in the draft report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| so everything that's going to be in it, we're going to have talked about it beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| so they can already be thinking about what they want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| And when they get the draft report, it will just be them formulating a response and sending it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| So hopefully that will expedite the turnaround time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| This is the first one that schools and I have worked on, so it may take just a tad bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| because I want to make sure the process works for everybody involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| and it's kind of our guinea pig process for responding to audits, these first couple are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| And like I said last week, this audit was never a got you and nothing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| It's just about making sure our processes are right, what we're supposed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| and everything's coming out of what fund it needs to come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| and what we designated for it to come out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| So, I mean, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| And we discussed last week about making sure that you had everything that you needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| because I know you're coming in and trying to rebuild an office by a certain standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| which has been needed apparently for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| And, you know, you said that, yeah, you're fine with the one staff that we've authorized for hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| and hopefully if you see that you need anything else that you'll come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| or come to the audit committee and say, hey, we need one more or we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Because we want to make sure that we're not setting you up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| We want to make sure we're setting your department up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| But I appreciate the work you've done on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| and being so open to the phone calls I know I've made to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| So, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Mine is not a PPU question, an audit question and statement, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| and one of the response from Andrea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| The audit committee felt it best that in, I guess these are called transitional audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Am I using that when one office holder comes in and another goes out and another comes in and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| And it's a foregone conclusion that Commissioner Hammond will be going into the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| and, of course, it's a possibility that another commissioner, myself, may be in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| And so, you know, there's an election, obviously, and I'm not presuming anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| But there's been that possibility and I'm technically, Andrea works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| There have been men of the audit committee and we serve at the pleasure of the entire commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| The audit committee felt it best that somebody besides Andrea do these two transitional audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| Now, correct me if I'm misstating or misinterpreting something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| But yet we thought you would be qualified without any potential of a conflict or undue worrying about a superior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=660)|
| 0:11:12| I'm groping with my words, but we thought it would be all right if you, as the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| did the other two transitional audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Would you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Well, it would be a little bit of an extra expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I don't have the number, but it would be some extra expense from Pewing Company if they were to do the trustee and the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| But that's sort of where we are and those four audits that need to happen probably in mid to late August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| I think you captured it perfectly, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| Commissioner Wright had brought up that there may be a potential conflict of interest, which is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| I would have to disclose that in our work papers that I would be auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| We'd have to figure out a way to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| So this actually is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| It removes the conflict from the internal audit department completely for those two, and they're larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| And with our current staff, there's not any way we could have done all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| This gives us the two smaller ones and lets Pew with the bigger staff and more experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| And they were just in the trustee's office doing work, quarterly work, to prepare for the financial statement audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| This gives them the staff and the experience already working in the trustee's office to go ahead and complete that and issue an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| And we'll do the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Okay. That's my Commissioner's word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Out of the Audit Committee, that was our recommendation as just described, and it is Item 51 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| So for follow-up on that, you can see in print her two and Pew's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=768)|
| 0:12:57| And I wanted to make sure that we understood the Audit Committee's rationale behind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| and that two of these audits will involve commissioners moving to a different elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=784)|
| 0:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| We didn't get a total cost on this, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| But it's not going to be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| No, we have a line item for that, for them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Yeah, so I think, I mean, of course, as a member of the Audit Committee, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| I think this makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Maybe we can get it back from the two offices that cost us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| And just to add a note of clarification, Larry Elmore at Pew & Company and I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| and we're going to be very careful to make sure that we align all of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| all four audits are going to have the same type of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| They're not going to be, the internal audits are going to look different than what Pew & Company is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| It's just going to be who's executing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| So we're going to deliver similar audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Any more questions on the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| I've been informed we need to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| So Clerk, field roll call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| On page two, item number six, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| approving the reappointments of, to serve as directors of the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| and the Health Educational Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| This is resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Todd, if you don't care to come forward, we, in your packet you should have a list of names that are in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| and I guess we'll take nominations on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| But, Todd, if you want to go ahead and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Commissioners, as you know or maybe remember, every two years we come before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| or excuse me, before this commission, for appointments of new members of the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| It's an 11-member board, and there's either three or four members of that body who have to be appointed by Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=919)|
| 0:15:29| We have submitted, we being the Industrial Development Board, at least five names for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| This body also can make its own nominations outside of these if they have some members that they would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| I do want to point out that Terry Henley was here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| and I have invited all the members that have been nominated, the folks that have been nominated to be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| I'd be happy to answer any questions about the Industrial Development Board, the work that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| if you have any of those, or the process by which we use to nominate members before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Thanks, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Just go ahead and tell us what you're looking for when you're in that nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| What are some of the qualifications that you're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| The types of items that we deal with that you're probably most familiar with is the approval of tax incentives in the form of PILOTs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| sometimes TIFs, which are pretty rare for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| The City Council, through its Housing Authority, does many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| Those are some things that are important, really, to get a perspective of, is this the type of project that makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=997)|
| 0:16:44| which we might forget, forego taxes, either because we need the project or we need the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| Also, the Industrial Development Board, from time to time, receives property, owns that property, and sells that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| They also serve as the Housing, Education, and Health Facilities Board, which deal with bond issuances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| So it serves as a conduit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| So that's the primary things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| You're really looking for some folks that have kind of a diverse perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| We've done a little bit to try to make sure that we are at least presenting some nominees from different portions of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| and a mix of men and women and people that represent the diversity of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| Who did you say you had with you today, Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Terry Henley is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| If he wants to come up and introduce himself, just kind of maybe two minutes on the background or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| since he's here and we appreciate you coming and being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Just give your name and address, sir, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Good afternoon. I'm Terry Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| My address is 1228 Pipe Tower Drive here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| I have been a resident here in Knox County since 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| I've served on several other boards, but I love the city of Knoxville, looking to do everything I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| In a number of ways, I think I served on a board with Mr. Smith there at Parks and Recreation some time back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| and I know several of you, but what do I know about this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| Not a lot, but I know that Knox County, Knox City, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| needs someone that has some time, willing to work, and be committed to doing what's ever necessary for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| and I would be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Your background gives some background about how your background correlates with the development board there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| I am an entrepreneur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| I've been in the insurance business for 34 years, since I was 22, so I get my age there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| I've invented gadgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| I have owned a couple of corporations, computer management, records management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1153)|
| 0:19:23| and I'm an entrepreneur from those school days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| and I'm still surviving this new technology, Twitter, Facebook, and all the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Before Terry started talking about himself, I just want to tell him that Terry is a really dynamic individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| I've known Terry a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| We actually went to church together for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Terry, he served as the chair of the UT Chancellor's Associates my last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| He's a big UT alumni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| He's done several, several, several boards throughout Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| He understands business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| He's definitely a worthy applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| I was actually pleased when I walked in and saw him, saw his packet here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| that he's stepped forward and offered up his valuable time to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| He will definitely be a worthy applicant, so thank you for agreeing to put your name forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Hopefully Monday we will vet the rest of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Hopefully you'll be one of the four, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Yes, I just wanted to say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Mr. Henley is well known in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| He's served on all these boards, and it's admirable for him to volunteer for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| We need good people on the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1249)|

| 0:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| I just had a question from schools on regarding these on the bidding process and what if these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1352)|
| 0:22:41| are special trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| That seems kind of high to me for a price on a dump truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| They got special equipment or are they run of the mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| I'm the superintendent of schools, 912 South K Street, and I don't consider myself an expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| on dump trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| I consider myself an expert on a lot of things, but dump trucks isn't one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| My understanding is these are just fairly standard in terms of their makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| We plan to use them for a variety of purposes, including spreading salt brine in the wintertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| in our parking lots and driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| So I think it's an aluminum bed rather than a steel bed to minimize corrosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| But other than that, I think they're fairly standard equipment, and that is the sum total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| of my knowledge of dump trucks right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Matt's in the back from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Do you have any questions from purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| No, I just was questioning that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I haven't bought a dump truck in a while either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| A pickup truck is about 50 grand, so I think that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| I was just curious about why you needed dump trucks, because we already have dump trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| and I assume that the engineering provided that service to the schools when we had salt issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| or whatever, snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| So I was just curious why we need dump trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| I don't think they do parking lots, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Engineering, like when we have a snow event, then engineering doesn't take care of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Just do not let the mayor drive it on a snowy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1482)|

| 0:28:30| And just as a follow-up to that, the current rules that were sent out to us this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1710)|
| 0:28:39| are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| It lets anybody that has a place of business here in Knox County operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| The only thing we need right now is some way to enforce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| So, I think that's what we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I think that, Mr. Chairman, I didn't get a chance to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| So, the ordinance that we passed before is still in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Everything stays the same until we come up with a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I think the legislative intent back in 1997 was to kind of prevent people from going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and peddling and not have a background check, business check, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| So, I've got a motion and a second to postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140616?start=1761)|
