| 0:00:00| Commissioners, it is 145, and we do not have any honorariums today, but we do have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:18| individual who has asked to speak to us during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| So Mr. Brian Moneyhun, if you would come forward, and if you wouldn't mind to repeat your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=21)|
| 0:00:25| and give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=25)|
| 0:00:27| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=27)|
| 0:00:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| Brian Moneyhun, 5512 Dogwood Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| Commissioners, you are presently tasked to choose a replacement for a retiring state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=38)|
| 0:00:44| senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| That choice could prompt another decision being made, should that replacement come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=46)|
| 0:00:53| your august body, as that would create a vacancy on county commission, which, as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| all know, are filled by appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Should that occur, I will implore you to fill that position with someone who has demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=64)|
| 0:01:13| their willingness to be a county commissioner, demonstrated through petition, through disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=73)|
| 0:01:20| through forum, through interview, and through meeting and greeting with a lot of the populace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| of this fair county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| That being said, let me here and now express my willingness to serve my community in such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| a capacity should the need arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| This shouldn't be looked at as an opportunity to enhance or deter anyone else's choice at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=99)|
| 0:01:49| replacing Senator Woodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| Simply, I would like to inform as many as possible about my desires in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=112)|
| 0:02:01| As I say, should need arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| You all have some weighty subjects on your minds, so I will not take up any more of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| time except to thank you for your service and to say good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| You may need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| Is there anyone else that would like to address us at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| If so, please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| If not, yes, Mr. Denola, would you like to give us your name and address of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=142)|
| 0:02:33| please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| William Daniels, 1505 Buttsford Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| The reason I'm coming before you, I think most of all of you, I'm sure, know that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| the chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals, and as that, I'm constantly getting questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| about non-soliciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| What does that actually mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Knox County will post non-solicitation signs at the entry to subdivisions, and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=178)|
| 0:03:08| given at least a dozen different versions of what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| On a given day, the other day when I called and asked to have an opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| I had these two put in my newspaper box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| One's from Nightscapes, and one's from a new approach cleaning, green cleaning company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| First of all, my understanding of non-soliciting is that it means that you can't engage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| any activity to try to sell me something on my private property, which includes my mailbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| which also has my newspaper box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| That's a violation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| So my question is, what does Knox County, what's, Mr. Jarrett, I've spoken to your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| several times, but what exactly is the law, and what do we do about people coming into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| areas where people do not want them coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Well, sir, don't ask the commission for a legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| If you want a legal opinion, I've got an attorney assigned to the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| If you want a formal legal opinion to the commission, we can give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| But asking the commission to cite a code section to interpret Tennessee law is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| If you had a question about the law, we will address it, but my office will address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Mr. Jarrett, with all due respect, I've asked your office on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| When you say my office, let's be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| With whom did you speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| And?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| He's researching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| If it was such a simple issue, it would have been resolved a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Obviously, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| But we'll get a legal opinion if one is necessary and warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| But again, what complicates thisâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| I think it is warranted, Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| It's warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| We'll move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| But the point is, a lot of these issues come about when you have entities that have homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| associations and oftentimes are being asked to interpret those rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| We cannot enforce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| We cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| The county posted a non-solicitation sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| The county did upon our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Is there or isn't there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| And if there isn't, then let's put some teeth into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| We had six break-ins in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| When the person was caught, one of the people caught, their front seat was full of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| that they were passing out for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| They were using it to case the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| It's not the first time that's happened in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| That's why we have non-solicitation as a designation for subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| So you're saying that one was issued and it's being violated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| You're saying one was issued by what, county codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Who issued the non-solicitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| I would guess Public Works is the one that came out and put the sign up at our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Our understanding was that, yes, there was a legal process that you reported people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| then they would, in turn, the Sheriff's Department would fine the people for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| About a month ago, we had an attorney from New York City called your office and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| to Daniel about the very same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| He said, well, you know, you really can't tell people they can't come into your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| I believe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Yeah, I believe that your homeowners association normally is the vehicle to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| The problem we have, of course, as you well know, and you've been in this business a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| time, putting teeth into it is not as simple as it sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| State law minimizes our enforcement capabilities, the amount of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| So it's a complex issue, but I'm not trying to minimize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I think it's an important one, but I think it's a legal opinion that's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| to come out of my office to advise the Commission what options they have, and that if it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| we can codify into a resolution or ordinance, we should do it unless the Commission thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Well, and again, I'm here representing several subdivisions, several groups of voters who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| would like to see there be more teeth put into this, or at least the teeth that is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| there being forced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| And we do this since Mr. Sanders is looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| I'm sure Mr. Jarrett will let us know when he has done that, and you'll report to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| This is an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| As you know, this gentleman's service on the BZA has been invaluable, and we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| it, and we will certainly push that to the top of the pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| So as soon as he gets something, he'll put it on the agenda for us, and we'll take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Anyone else like to address us at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| If not, Commissioners, we are adjourned until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=470)|

| 0:15:45| Our devotional today will be by Commissioner Richard Briggs, followed by the Pledge to the Flag from Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| Commissioner Briggs, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Let's bow our heads to pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Our Heavenly Father, thank you so much for giving us a beautiful Easter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| where we were able to celebrate the resurrection of your son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Thank you also for giving us the ability to assemble today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| and discuss in a democratic and civilized manner how we wish to be governed in our local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| Give us the wisdom and the courage to be considerate, but also to make the right decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| and know that what we're trying to do would be the way that you would have us to act and to behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| And finally, our Heavenly Father, bless and look after our soldiers and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| who are protecting the freedoms that we enjoy to assemble together for our freedom of speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| and they also preserve the ability for us to worship the way we wish to worship you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| In your son's name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Everyone please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| one Nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| Before we get to the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| I'd like to recognize Dr. Buchanan from the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Commissioner Wright had talked about a run that he was involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| and also a run that he and Commissioner Broyles are going to be involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and so Dr. Buchanan wanted to address us briefly about something along the same line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Your name and address on the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Martha Buchanan, Director of the Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Actually, I'm speaking as Commissioner Hammond's proxy, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| Knox County Health Department, for the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| has had a grant from the State Department of Health to decrease diabetes rates and increase activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| This year, we've opened it up to a community walking program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| We currently have more than 900 participants throughout Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| who formed groups to walk together over an eight-week period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| The first day of the eight-week period is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| And we recently expanded to Knox County employees, city employees, and KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| KUB has been part of the program for several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| And Commissioner Hammond and I decided to challenge all of you to create a walking group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| and over the next eight weeks document your walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| and see if you can't beat my team, the administrative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| I have my pedometer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And take more steps than any other group in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| To set an example, I know some of you have recently lost some weight, which I applaud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| And this is one way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| You can walk for your whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| It's not something that's limited to just about anybody can walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| So I have program information and handouts for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| And whether you choose to participate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| keep the pedometer from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| This is a state of Tennessee grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| So all the little trinkets that are in your packets are actually paid for by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I'm happy to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| So I'll pass these out and you guys can look at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| and hopefully they'll take part in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And if you have any questions, here's your chance to ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| So, again, we just put the pedometer on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| And you're asking about 10,000 steps a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Isn't that kind of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Ideally, you want to get around 10,000 steps a day to improve your health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| Most of us don't take that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| I think you'll be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Those of us that think we walk a lot put the pedometers on and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| wow, I don't walk as much as I think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| And so just to increase your activity level by a little bit makes a huge difference in your sleep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| in your health, in your weight, and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| And there is some documentation to be done and you do need a team leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| and you can decide amongst yourself who your team leader might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Trina Gallman's the contact at the county level who's doing this, the Bright Start program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| Just another partnership between Bright Start and Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| to improve the health of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| I was going to ask how we document it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| I think I'll be happy to volunteer as you all understand that I'm going to be riding you really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| to get out and walk every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| You guys can walk together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| You know, we can make this a walking meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| I nominate Amy Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1230)|

| 0:20:32| I'm coming after every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| You're going to be moving, like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| I'll have mine by 10 o'clock every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Commissioner Burroughs, the directions are in the packet as to the details of how you document that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| I'm still trying to figure that out myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Commissioner Burroughs and myself, we are participating in the run for the schools this coming Saturday morning at the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| along with all the other members here of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| I'm looking forward to us participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| I have a breakthrough buddy from the autism run, which was a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| to remind me to make sure that the run for the schools this coming Saturday morning at the zoo was announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1272)|

| 0:21:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| You have to walk half as far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Dr. Buchanan, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1294)|

| 0:21:45| That's right, we have a doctor here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| All right, let's move on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Is there an approval for the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| I think the resolution that Dwight gave â€‘â€‘go ahead, Dwight, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| I just did want to bring to commission's attention that resolution R114401 was slightly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| It's actually three parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| The third parcel that we've added is a very small parcel of about two acres that's surrounded by the two larger parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| So the resolution does look slightly different from what you saw last week in that it actually specifies three parcels instead of two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| but it's not a material change otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| We will pull that off consent so that we can properly address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| So that's one item that will be taken off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time, on R11-4-905, that's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Before I'm going to recuse myself on that, but I'll be voting for everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| So you'll be recusing yourself when you said on number 905?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| On page 6, section H, the ordinances on first reading, it's O-11-4-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| I'd like to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| If not, we'll defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Which one is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| It's the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| It's the one about the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Yes, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Mr. Chairman, I guess it's a point of privilege on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| John King, PO Box 2425 in Office of Tennessee 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| First of all, I would express appreciation for moving this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| and having some further discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| but I wanted to sort of correct or change something I said last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| I am going to be advising and counseling with Ms. Witt on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| and I am not going to be charging her a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Are there any other amendments or corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| If not, anything that needs to be added to be added, changed, changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=1441)|

| 0:33:21| Let's go back to the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2001)|

| 0:33:45| 106.49 acres located at 8707 Joe Daniels Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| and 2.51 acres located at 0 West Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| for a total of 159.86 acres to be by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Mr. Vandivate, were you going to get us some appraisal information, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| or some additional information by today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| The appraisal was just handed to me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| In rough numbers, the property appraised at about $1,200,000 in present market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:22| Just a couple other follow-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Commissioner Brown, you'd asked us to calculate the usable acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Just using a definition of total that's paved, graveled, or cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| that's about 23 acres of the 159 on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| The rest is wooded or sloping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Now, that appraisal also includes the additional two acres that you gave us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Yes, sir, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| It includes all three parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| And the amount again, what, 1.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Just slightly shy of 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And Mr. Myers reminded me, Matt Myers, the Deputy Director of Purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| reminded me of an important point, too, that I had overlooked previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| and that is that following the results of this auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| this matter still comes back before this body to ratify that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| So, this would not be the last and final stop as far as the county's ownership of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| So, if the price doesn't come in satisfactorily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| or there's some form of a problem, it does come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| It is not an absolute auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| It does come back to this body for ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| And what timetable are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Well, we're under contract until July 31st with natural resources recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| So, as soon as practical after that, I'd like to think we can get it on the market sometime in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Hey, Dwight, what's the possibility of doing the auction prior to the close of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| Is that unethical or is it undoable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| It's probably a purchasing question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| I'm, quite frankly, not sure I'm qualified to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Matt or Hugh might want to take a shot at it, but I just honestly don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| There's somebody coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| 1,000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| The ethical situation, I think, is what we need to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| They've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| We're under contract until the end of July, and I think we ought to honor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| and then look at putting it out for auction at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Are we going to set a reserve or are we going to just do an absolute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Not talked about that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| We have an RFP for auctioneering services opening May 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Once we get the auctioneer in place, and this is for all properties that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| It's not specific to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| We'll sit down with the auctioneer and see what they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| and, you know, get some feedback from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| That comes back when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| When will we open the NOS bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| May 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Mr. King, you wish to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| My address is already in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| On another matter, speaking on behalf of the current occupant of the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| let me say we're perfectly willing, if the county wants to go ahead with the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| and move forward as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| we're perfectly willing for that auction to take place while we're still on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| They can offer, if you will, to deliver occupancy to whoever the successful bidder is on August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| But if they want to go ahead and move forward and get this property sold now, we have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| We have no problem with them doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| We'll give them access to the property to the extent necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| And I have been asked to get that word to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| I just haven't gotten it done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Mr. Vannevey, do you think that may be an option to go ahead and move on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Again, I'd want to confer with purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Since they have a bid on the street for auction services, I'm not exactly sure where that would leave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| But, obviously, that bid only closes in a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| And whenever they have an auctioneer on board and will be prepared on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| we've got the appraisal in hand and we'll be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| If not, we have a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2287)|

| 0:38:14| It is requested that the Knox County Law Director conduct research to determine whether Section 2-286 of the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| may be amended to provide for the reimbursement of Knox County employees and elected and appointed officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| for court costs and attorney's fees in matters other than ouster lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| or matters not otherwise provided for in Section 2-286 of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| Again, we're asking him just to look into it and bring us back a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2325)|

| 0:38:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| That's the one you had one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| We had one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Larry Smith recused himself on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Resolution 906 is regarding an application for tax increment financing, TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| filed with the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox by I-4075 Business Park, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Quick question for Mr. Mamatov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| Again, it's more on the thinking and the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| This one's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| But what I'm trying to understand is what were you all thinking back in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| just to try to understand what this flavor of TIF is for going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| So in terms of economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| was the thinking that we would take areas that are growing and grow them more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| Were we not thinking at all just wherever it happens, it happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Or was it more of a targeted kind of approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| The honest answer is when we drafted the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| we were really thinking more projects directly that the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| or the Development Corporation was actively initially involved in the development of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| But it was intentionally drafted broadly to create some discussion on the use of tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| as an economic development tool for other types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| And as I mentioned before, I really thought that when that legislation came forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| there would be that sort of discussion, but it got adopted as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Ironically, we are now having that discussion, as I mentioned to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| in terms of the legislation that's working its way through the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| And it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I got an email just this morning where they've amended it yet again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| where the Attorney General has weighed in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| we really think you should limit this to public infrastructure in support of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| So this type of TIF that was being considered today is of a type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| that the Comptroller's Office apparently is signing, you know, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| hey, this is good economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| I've had a large number of people weigh in saying that this is too restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| but this seems to be sort of a compromised approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| that if you're doing it in support of public infrastructure like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| it's something that the state seems comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| And in terms of is this going to turn its way through to fruition at this session next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:23| the second half of this session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| The legislation I mentioned to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| the amendment is supposed to be presented to committee this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| They're closing down the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| So it's either going to be this week or next week that I'll be able to summarize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| or report back to you guys for what limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| how the TIF laws are changed by this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| So unless it's voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| the Comptroller has made it very clear that he would like to see this legislation get approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| in this legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| And so I'd ask, and I'm sure you were probably already planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| once that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| it would be great to get some kind of workshop or session just to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| I was just talking to Todd about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| He was hoping to do that in early May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| and he was asking me whether I think that would be a good time if you all were interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| And then, Todd, I'm going to get my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| So in terms of, and, again, I'm wanting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| we're going to have to get, and I definitely understood what you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| you're not, this isn't before us as something that the IDB has vetted and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| yay, we support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| And I do understand that's not where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| So, and I'm not trying to undo your flowchart either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| I mean, if that works for you, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| You know, there's some dangers in that, you know, not knowing what your thoughts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I would think would be a danger going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| So how can we get a feel, because as I think Mr. Mamathoff said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| this is kind of a tool for, you know, for you all to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| It's a good tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| It's a, when rightly used, an appropriate tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| So how can we get a feel for what the IDB is saying about these projects as they come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:17| What would happen today if this body directed the IDB to move forward with an economic impact plan was we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:26| I'll answer your question, but kind of go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| We will have a third-party engineering firm do an analysis for us to make sure that the numbers are correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| and accurate or within, you know, reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| We'll look through the financials to make sure that the assumptions look reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| and then take that before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Now, you know, they're really looking to you all to say, you know, are the proposed improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| in this case the improvements to Everett Road, a priority for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| and is this how this body and the county wants to fund those improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| So, you know, the Industrial Development Board has always seen itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| certainly back when we vetted through these, as a board concerned with economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| And traditionally it had to be, you know, more of an industrial type or distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| or things like that versus retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I think things have changed a little bit, so I can't speak for them because we've not really vetted through one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Probably you'd be more in favor of this, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| I mean, there's 11 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| What we wanted to do was, kind of the way we set this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| is to make sure that at least you had the information in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| Because at one time we had people that were applying for TIFs coming straight to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| We never even saw the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| It would be very limited information for you to look at and to make any type of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| So we were able to at least circumvent that from happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| that you had better information when considering these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| But it really is a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Is the improvements that they're proposing a priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| And if so, then, you know, kind of direct the IDB to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| and do a little bit more due diligence on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| And it will come back to this body if it gets through the IDB one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| And I guess my, well, I lied at one of my last questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:31| I like the process that I just heard described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| And I don't know if that's how we got here today, but I like that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| I like there being a priority given by our engineering department, by our mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| by the people who are out there every day that knows what the needs of Knox County are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| saying that these are high priority if we're going to give an incentive and have those come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| I didn't hear that this road project, road enhancement, was an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| We can talk about people cutting through and getting to Oak Ridge, you know, as long as the day is long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| But, you know, we have roads issues in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| And is this number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Is this number 200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| You know, it's definitely not number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| It's definitely not number 200 either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| But so I guess what I'm wanting to do in this whole thing, if it's time for another road study, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| If it's time to engage TDOT and see you're planning on 10 interchange upgrades, is this number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| Is this number 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Is it time to engage them in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| I just don't want us to be a rubber stamp organization because we are talking about taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| So you have one or two Democrats sitting here saying we need to be more conservative on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| So, you know, let's take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Yes, not money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| They're going to pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| But this is an incentive, which I dare say, a financial incentive, which I dare say would be a deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| So, you know, as I see this project, I'm actually softened way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I've softened up on this one as I drove the area because, as Commissioner Norman says, and I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| Mametoff said, this may be considered blighted by the butchering that's occurred up there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| So I do compliment and the plans look solid to cure that ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:42| So, you know, I'm actually, you know, I'm on the fence on this one, but what I'm not on the fence on is saying it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| tough regardless of where it is, regardless, you know, what it is on priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| Let's approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Let's stop and think about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| Let's stop and think about is this area okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| You know, I think if we're not given a priority on the roads, then we're left to make a decision based on economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:14| drivers in terms of per capita income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| You may say it's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I say it's not unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| So here we are, we're going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| We'll base it on, you know, jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| I say we need more higher paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| You say minimum wage jobs are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| So here we are discussing things that may not even be germane to the issue of why we're giving the TIF in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| I'm imploring the industrial development folks, give us a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| Throw us a bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Let us know what you're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I'm imploring the engineering folks to say give us a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Let us know what this priority, this racks up and stacks up in terms of a priority, and then we can make an informed vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Let me ask Mark a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| I guess it's just TIF 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| You and I discussed it briefly in the hallway last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| I'm going to use round numbers and just tell me if this flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| I want to look at the cash flow and just see if I'm reading it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| So the property for round numbers, it's assessed at $1 million now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Ballard's people come through and reassess it at $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Tax bills go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| They should have been paying $10,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| They begin paying $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| So the county, that $100,000 checks goes into the trustee's office, the Knox County trustee, not a third-party trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:41| $10,000 remains in this building or goes into the general fund eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| and $90,000 goes to whatever bank buys that bond that needs tax-free financing or needs tax-free paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| Everything was correct until the 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Keep in mind that based on the existing IDB policies, 40,000 of that number goes to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| The county gets to keep because the existing policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| And Mr. Maddox was not asking for a deviation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| He asked for a little longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| So roughly about $100,000, somewhere between $50,000 and $60,000, actually, will stay in the county's coffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| and the remainder will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| And the reason I say $50,000 to $60,000, it depends on what your debt service component is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| because not only do you keep the $40,000, you keep your debt service component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| So if that's 10% of your tax revenues, you keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| So it's hard to give you an exactly precise number because it changes each year based on your debt service component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| But a substantial, at least half of it, will stay in the county's coffers, and about half of it will be used to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Okay, so at least half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| And I guess those numbers are determined because it's not a floating rate, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Like what we talked about with our managers last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| It's a set 3% or 2.75, or is it a floating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| The way TIFs usually work is they're often floating during the construction period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and what usually happens is the incremental tax revenues are used to pay interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| and any remainder is used to reduce the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| You want to get the principal paid off as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| So if there's $300,000, for example, available and interest is 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| the remaining $250,000 would be used to pay down the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Your goal is to pay the TIF off as quickly as it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| That's in the county's best interest to get the money coming back to it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| It's in the developer's best interest to get that monkey off its back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| It's not a set amortization schedule then, or it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Usually more than you want to know, but possibly, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| Okay, I will ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Normally what banks do in this is they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| okay, you guys have approved a 20-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| We won't let you go for the full 20 years on an assumed amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Maybe they'll let you go 15 to 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| They want to know that there's some gap years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| that in case the TIFs aren't adequate that there'll be some gap there to pay it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| So what they'll say is, okay, let's amortize this at an assumed amortization over, say, 17 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| and if the payments are not adequate from the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| what usually happens in the early years is they look to, I'm sorry, Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| but look to Mr. Maddox to make up the shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Now he's not on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| We get our taxes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Yes, you get your taxes first, and if the debt service in that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| and it's usually assumed debt service based on an assumed amortization is $400,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| and the available TIF revenues only produces $300,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| they're going to look at Steve and say, hey, I need my $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| And Steve, the way these TIFs usually work is he could get paid back on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| if he has to advance debt service, but often that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Often developers are out of luck, and they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| if they have to advance money in the early years, they often don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| And there's no third-party trustee like State Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| or anybody as we know them from the traditional bond issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| No, Commissioner Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| And these, all the ones we've done, both the blight ones with KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| and the couple of IVB TIFs have all been private placements with banks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| where the county trustee either cuts a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| or wires the money directly to the holder of the TIF, and there's no bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| No, that saves administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| No, reduces administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I have a lot of the same concerns that Sam does, and we talked about this some last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| I thought about a lot of the comments that were made, have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| and some of the points that have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| and I'm still not comfortable voting for this TIF at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| I am looking forward to a workshop on this, and I would like us to see, as Sam said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| have a little more firm notion of exactly when a TIF is now appropriate and when it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:51| My feeling right now is that as this is the fastest growing area of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| this is going to develop without any help from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| It's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| And I understand that there are roads there that need to be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| but, again, I need something from our engineering department that says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| before I'm ready to just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| The job creation is important, and we had some conversation about this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| And there is certainly a place for minimum wage jobs in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| but I think that we need to be saving our incentives for people who are creating the kind of job that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| keep a family of four above the poverty line with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| So the creation of minimum wage jobs just doesn't hold as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| All jobs are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| but I don't feel like our incentives need to be saved for those who are willing to do the kind of job creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3290)|
| 0:55:01| that will, like I said, support a family of four above the poverty line, and that provides decent benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| And I'd also like to see sustainable development be brought in and part of that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| Another concern that I have is that if we are, and we talked about this, too, last week, that these are minimum wage jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| Where are the people who are going to work in these jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| Where are they going to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| There's very little affordable housing in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| So I think those are all interconnected issues that we need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and I just would like to have a little more of a clearer vision moving forward before I'm comfortable approving a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| such as this and for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| So I'm looking forward to a workshop and some very in-depth discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| because I don't want us to become TIF happy, which I've seen these government boards do in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3355)|
| 0:56:04| I think we need to move forward very deliberately with these sorts of incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| First of all, I'd like to say thank you, Mark Mendenhoff, for all his work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| and the detail that goes into the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| And apparently the way this is arranged seems to be certainly in consideration of the county's interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:34| Some of the risks that are involved, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| I would like to ask somebody, and I don't know who this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| It might be Mr. Maddox, but probably Mr. Maddox, in terms of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| and a couple more things about the site itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| That is, when I visited, and I'm just viewing it from the interstate or basically Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| when I go down Watt Road, I was curious about the development of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| and I know that the pads that you have in place, and it looks like you've got six major pads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| or at least there's six signs that say site available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| and sort of stacked up going up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| When you developed your site, or when you got approval for whatever you've done so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:27| was there consideration of the slope and height, elevations, and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| Did you have some other site plans or concept plans that you considered in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| Steve Maddox, Everett Road, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Yes, sir, we reviewed several different sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Maybe another good example might be the one there at the corner of Pellissippi Parkway and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| No, I'm talking about this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Any alternative plans or arrangement of how you're setting your pads on this site, this one at Watt Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| I was going to talk about that one just for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| An alternative was they went in there and just put pads in different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| where we felt you get a better benefit if you go in and level the pads off as you go up the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:22| and make them even on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| The entire site, we hired GEOS Engineering as our soil engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| and all of the work there has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| The angle of the slopes and everything, the compaction, the grade, the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| the grade of the roads and all has been handled by GEOS Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I guess what I'm getting at is when I'm looking at this site, I'm going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| I wonder how many of those pads they really needed to make this work for them economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| This is kind of a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants thing, which we do sometimes here on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Don't look at me like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| I thought, well, those bottom four pads, those are not too objectionable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:16| But as somebody that's been really involved in the slope and ridgetop stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| I'm going, well, I wonder if they would consider taking out those top two pads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| and reforesting, reclaiming the rest of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| If there was some discussion of that, I wouldn't have any problem whatsoever with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| But I don't know whether you considered that in your concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| But it would be one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| It would be one of those compromised things where you all get your commercial site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| and the people that are more oriented towards the aesthetic side get what they want too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| And it seems like it would be a reasonable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| So that's what I'm, you know, I know this is springing it on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| But I'm wondering, what's that make you feel like when I introduce something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| and say, what about donating those top two pads and turning that back into forest OSM standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:26| That gives you the heebie-jeebies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| The top two pads that you mentioned, the one on the left as you go up the road is 28 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:38| The one on the right is 14 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| So that's approximately 50 acres of the 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| And so from an economic viewpoint, you know, that's pretty easy to figure, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| My other question then is, I take that as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| And the other question then is, is this all this in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| Or is some of the road in another county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| It is all 100% in Knox County, the roads and the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| So all road improvements, there is nothing outside of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| I don't have anything for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Question for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Could you all discuss and you may, I forgot your name, you may want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:33| Have you all done any kind of general traffic count studies on that road that they're trying to improve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| And could you just talk to me a little bit about the road and some of the issues, some of the dynamics of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| shoulders, crazy tall sidewalks, and I know that doesn't exist, but, you know, width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| Could you all talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| I'll let Ms. Pianchi, Cindy Pianchi, who's our staff traffic engineer, speak to the technical side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| And she also has some crash data that she's brought along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| I would encourage you as you hear crash data and you think about the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| you remember that it is a snapshot of the present day at best and looking backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| because it's a description of things that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And one of the things that I think commission might have to consider in this discussion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| as improvements are made on this site and additional traffic volumes increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| as development perhaps happens on the Loudoun County side, which is outside the realm of our control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| how they might affect the area and how they might change these numbers over time so that if a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| two years from now, three years from now, we're looking back at this, traffic volumes have gone up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| and crash data has changed and it's changed negatively that, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| this body isn't looking at us and saying, how did you let this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:51| For starters, Mr. Vanderbeek mentioned the crash data that we have collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| Essentially what we have found out is that in the last five and a half years at the intersection of El Camino,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| Watt Road and Everett Road, there have been nine crashes between where El Camino, Everett and Watt Road meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| back towards Buttermilk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Once again, we had six crashes in a five and a half year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| Typically, as we do our crash data analysis, we take a look at the last three years' worth of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| and look for trends and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Just based on the raw numbers, that's not a big deal based on other locations that we have in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| But we do regularly try to update our data and go out and look at all of our different crash location sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| Currently, current volumes out there are probably in about 3,500 cars per day range, or vehicles, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:51| 3,500 per?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| So has the developer got an idea of what their development is going to yield in terms of traffic increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| The traffic impact study that I've reviewed, and we have not had our chance yet, typically on these traffic studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Knox County gets together with both the combination of, in this case, it will be TDOT will be involved because of the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| and we also get together with the TPS staff slash MPC staff to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| because as they do their development and subdivide the property, they will have to be involved in that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| We have not had our group meeting yet to critique the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| but what I've read is they expect this development to produce about 25,000 trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| which is more on the Cedar Bluff Road, for those of you that are familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| that's essentially the traffic volumes you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| You know, I guess hearing that, is this enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Are we talking about enough road for, because I'm assuming they're not going to stand out there on an island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| like I think folks have said, generally, you know, they build it and it's successful, more will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| So are these, in your engineering eyes and engineers' eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| would the newly configured road take us forward with a development that might put up Cedar Bluff-type traffic on Everett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:21| Essentially what's probably the biggest issue that we're going to have is the fact that the road improvements that are proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| I want to say there's probably like an eight-lane section at the intersection of Watt Road, Everett Road, and El Camino,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| is what's proposed to handle all of the traffic that they will generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| The problem that we have is the ramps at Watt Road and the bridge that goes over the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:48| In terms of timelines for getting that fixed, currently the TPS staff has made a request to the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:57| to do what they call an interchange modification study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| At this point, TDOT has not agreed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| They're looking for more information, and then once they actually do the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| they've got to figure out where it fits in to the rest of the priorities within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Question, Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| He was about to fall asleep, that's why I wanted to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| What is the percentage of sales tax monies that would come to the Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| For each dollar, how much would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Right at 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Okay, so at 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| By the figures that Mr. Maddox gave us, it's about $9 million a year in sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| This is after everything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| The buildings are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| People are hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| It's up and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| So, if it's $9 million a year and it's at 72%, you're good with math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| What would that be on a yearly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| Round number is 600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| It would be more than that if it's 9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| That's 78%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| You talked about this is all play money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| I'm sorry, $9 million in sales tax revenue and you said it's 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| Okay, I was thinking 9 million in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Yes, in sales tax revenue that would be gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Okay, so 9 million in sales tax, 72% of that would be well over 6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| So, anyway, you look at it, once this is up and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| and you look at the potential sales tax revenue that's coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| 72% of that is going to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Even if these are minimum wage jobs, and they're not all going to be minimum wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| because you're going to have management people in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| you're looking at some hotel, you're looking at retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| you're looking at a variety of wage scales, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| But let's say that it is all minimum wage, or let's say an average of $10 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:58| At that point, at 1,600 jobs, you're still looking at $640,000 a week in payroll, if my figures are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| You put that out on a total yearly basis, isn't that about $33 million in payroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| That's the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Yes, and there's an element of the multiplier effect as that is spent once, it gets spent more than one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| Right, exactly, because as they get their paycheck, they're going to be spending, that's going to be more sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| My point being is that you're looking at a development that basically there's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| If you've driven by there, and I drive by there a lot, you know that it's barren, there's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| We've got an individual who wants to put something there that's going to bring monies back into Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| particularly $0.72 out of every dollar generated in sales tax that's going to our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| It's going to be creating jobs, regardless of the kinds of jobs being created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| you're looking at millions of dollars a year in payroll that's going to be coming from that piece of property down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| I think this is a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Our schools have had to make some tough cuts this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Well, no question about it, and I know that when you're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| and you're looking at the North Shore thing that we did, I mean, those two developments together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| you're looking at quite a substantial amount of monies that's going to be going to our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| So, I guess my point is that I'll take this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| And so, are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Yes, I had a couple of comments and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Can this area be annexed by Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| I may be mistaken, Amy, but I think Farragut's urban growth only goes over to where just north of the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| to where the Outlets Limited Mall is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I don't think they have urban growth area down to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| I may be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| I do remember him talking a little bit about that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| I don't know what it --again, I don't know what they're studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| But I guess theoretically, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| And I also wanted to point out that speculating about how much money is going to be brought in and tax money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| that's all well and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| But I've never seen a development like this that was stayed 100% full 100% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| So, I don't think that it's fair to say that at best it could generate this much or X amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:16| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| You know, hotel and retail and restaurants are not the kind of jobs that you can really support a family on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:29| So, they may not be rock bottom minimum wage, but they're not a whole lot better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| And I agree that we need jobs of, you know, in every category and every range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| I think we need to save our incentives for the groups that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| and creating the high-quality, higher-wage jobs with good benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| We need to have --I think those are the types of developments that I would like to see given incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4254)|
| 1:11:04| And, again, the problem, too, is where are the people going to live who are going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| and take these low-paying jobs because there's certainly not affordable housing in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| I'm wondering how many people we're going to get that are going to be living in Loudoun County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| but coming to work at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| So, I know we talked about this some last week a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| and it's a conversation that I think is worth continuing even after today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| So, I hope that we will keep going on this and keep thrashing this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:38| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Yes, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| I was going to say that is the potential of what could be gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| And I want you to say what you want to say, but let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| How much is being generated right now in tax revenue from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| If you did nothing, how much is being generated right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| So, we're looking at $3,000 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| And if you walk away from this, we're walking away from the potential of a lot more than $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| So, yes, I'd like you to comment on whatever you'd like to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| Last week, Commissioner McKenzie asked a question about the types of jobs that were going to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| We took information from a combination of sources, our economic impact study that we had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| information from the U.S. Shopping Center Employment, that's from ICSC, National Restaurant Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| and combined it with information from the U.S. Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| And that would be in the handout I just handed out under question one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| And these jobs were taken from the impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| It shows a total there of 1,610 jobs, what the average income per person earned in the different components of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:54| And it equates to $44,983,000, or almost $45 million a year in income, $27,939 per year per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4374)|
| 1:13:08| which is probably 70% or so over minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| A lot of these jobs are managerial, president and vice presidents, and sales people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| A lot of sales people in these types of positions, as well as the minimum labor jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| and the restaurant jobs with the tips and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| So those are the numbers that we came up with when we backed into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| Also, the question two was a question that Mr. Norman asked last week about what the property looked like when I purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:48| And there's a series of photographs of a borrow pit that those pictures were taken at the time I purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:58| If you look at those, I think what we've got out there looks a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| And as we move forward, this project is going to be landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| It's going to be developed in a first-rate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| I've been given the names of Mark Campin and David Vandergriff as a couple of people that could help in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| Also, we always try to use the very best people available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| I haven't had a chance to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I've placed a call or two for them, but I haven't been able to talk with them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| But I was going to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| And one of them takes the blue line stream we mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| and adds features to those that continues the blue line stream, but also makes some nice water features out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| Works good with TDEC, which I had an agreement with TDEC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| And Mr. Vandergriff is an arborist with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| And we're going to talk to him about the types of trees and replantings that we use out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| I hope that answers those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| And then, let's see, Commissioner Wright asked for a schedule, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| of the time frame for the road developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| I've put that in on the front page there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| I think, you know, we're all aware that if there's nothing on there right now, it's not generating much in terms of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| I think we're all aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| But my point was that this is the fastest growing area of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| and it's going to develop whether we give an incentive or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| If this man in development organization chooses to step away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| there will be someone else coming in fairly quickly to take it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| So this area is going to develop without any help from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| Also, someone has shared with me here that with minimum wage jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:15| transportation is an issue because a lot of folks who are supporting a family on minimum wage jobs can't afford to own an automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| And in Knox County, we don't have a good public transportation system that is only within the city except for a couple of the express routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:34| So that's another issue to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| But I think we're all aware that when there's nothing on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| there's not much generated in terms of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| But I think we're all in agreement that this area is growing pretty rapidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| and development is going to happen there without very much intervention on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| I think that's a good point and one that we really haven't thought about, the public transportation part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:05| And that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Maybe it could be some transportation could be arranged that would service this project and the Turkey Creek project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| They're going to be right there close together and one in line with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| I was going to say, and that's exactly the kind of thinking that I like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| and that I hope that these sorts of issues will generate that won't be a rubber stamp that these are things that we need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| and we need to be promoting and rewarding our developers who are willing to be progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:43| and who are willing to look at the complete picture when they're talking about developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| That's what I think we need to be putting our incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Regarding the fastest developing part of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| I would like to compare this with the Pellissippi Parkway at Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| and the Watt Road entering into the southwest end of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| I think that by far the fastest growing area is there at Hardin Valley and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| And if you look, those are exactly the roads like we're talking about building down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| except the county built those roads, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| And we need some help down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I was looking on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| If their map is correct, it's not in the urban growth boundary for Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| so I don't think it's not in their boundary to annex currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4723)|

| 1:18:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Commissioner Smith, did you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Raise your hand, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4737)|

| 1:19:21| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| We don't have anybody for public forum now, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I know we do at zonings, but no, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4767)|

| 1:19:35| and oversight of the public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Commissioner Brown, were you wanting to talk about that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| on the public building authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| They're here, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| They're over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4782)|

| 1:19:44| PBA folks are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4784)|

| 1:19:51| They have a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| They stayed here for four-plus hours last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| and got put off at dinner time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| So I understand it's about a 10-minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| I would like for them to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4807)|

| 1:20:33| Do you need about five minutes to set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| We can take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Let's take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| We'll come back around 310, and we'll receive their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=4843)|
