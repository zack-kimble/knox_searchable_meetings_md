| 0:00:00| Thank you so much for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=0)|
| 0:00:29| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=29)|
| 0:00:31| This is a mission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| This is specifically for you all to ask me questions about a little deeper into this draft transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=33)|
| 0:00:45| You all will hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| We're really looking forward to sharing with you the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| Again, we've been working on this the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| We've had some workshops with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| This is probably the first time we've really had to deep dive into the draft plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| Just a reminder, it has been posted on our website since October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| Very little change has been made to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| The material is in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| You have the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| Then you have the document at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=76)|
| 0:01:23| Items revised from the October draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| I sent all this information to you all via e-mail in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| I hope you got a chance to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Additionally, I just want to point out a couple of things that we can talk as we go through the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| The Knox County Relationship with Plans is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| That looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| The place type categories and zoning, which we'll dive a little deeper into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| Then I printed you all off a copy of the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| You didn't have electronic copies, but I wanted to make sure you had it in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| Just briefly to review the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| We'll go over some instructions here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| We want to talk about that plan, purpose, and background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Give you the overview of the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Again, some of this will be repeat from some of you all, because you've been involved since the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| We really want to get down to the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| We'll talk about the future land use map, that draft map, implementation measures, and how we intend to amend this going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| and then to track our progress over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Throughout this, I think we're comfortable with taking questions as we go through the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| so feel free to, if something comes to mind, if you have a comment or question, please jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| Is that agenda sound okay, everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Just some brief introductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Our, what we call our advance talks team, most of you know us, but just as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| we have Maggie Benedict from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| We have Jim Snowden from engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Kathy Olson has been our project manager throughout this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| And we have Adam Chitron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| And then from our team, we have Michelle Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| And then Terri Betula, who's our director of innovation and research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| And then our consultant team is led by Kim Lathorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Some of you've met Christina with them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| And then she brought her colleague, Jonathan, Whitehurst, with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| I'm going to give you a hint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=202)|
| 0:03:31| Okay, so our plan is, as many of you know, it's over 20 years old now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| This is what we, our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| And so to be effective, our plan really does need to be considerably updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| to account for a new competition, new data, new technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| and other things that a community might experience further on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| And so over the past 20 years, the county region has, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| on about a 200-day basis, has experienced a really significant amount of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| changes in demographics, marketing, and new options for global pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| and how we do business in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| County-wide growth is anticipated to continue over the next two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| By 2045, the county is projected to reach over 550,000 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| And we don't expect this continued influx of new residents to change much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| And it's going to be a primary factor in influencing how we grow over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| Knox County is a really attractive place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| There was a headline today that Knoxville, particularly, is definitely on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| as a mid-sized city that's very desirable if people want to move to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| And I think that has a lot to do with the community pride that we have here in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| And it's such a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| And it's generally an easy place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| And so there is a strong desire by the community to maintain those characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| you know, as we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| That's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| That's one thing we're really doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| So in response to increased development pressures and requests from the community back in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Mayor Jacobs launched this event called Thought Threads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| And the purpose was to define what our vision is for the next 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| and create that plan that's going to guide us in transportation investments for the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=327)|
| 0:05:37| I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about our growth policy plan today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| but I think it's important to briefly discuss this plan and what it does, does, and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| And put it into context with some of the other tools that we have in the community to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| You all consider the growth policy plan on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| So you're quite familiar with it, but just to give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| The growth policy plan is intended to expand into three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| which is the urban growth area, the planned growth area, and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| And as part of these updates to our comprehensive plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| we need to take a look at those outreach, and that map is going through the process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| But of all of our plans, the growth policy plan and map is really the most general of our tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| And so reading this map does not tell us everything that's shown in yellow, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| is going to be suburban residential development or that every parcel in the rural area is going to be farmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| What it does tell us is that areas in yellow have been identified as places that future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| might be able to be accommodated for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| And there are things that you just, you know, when you look at this, you can't necessarily make sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| but you can begin to understand when we lay that comprehensive land use and transportation plan over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| So the growth policy plan answers the most general questions of where could growth be accommodated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| and the comprehensive plan answers questions about what types of land uses are most appropriate in what different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| So this is the point where we begin to understand where residential development might occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| and where mixed-use centers, for example, might be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| So what is a comprehensive plan or a general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| A lot of communities call them general plans. Our RRL plan is called the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| It is that long-term guide that is intended to express the values of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| the aspirations and needs and the unique conditions of our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| and of those neighborhoods that make up the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| It is intended to establish integrated vision for growth and infrastructure investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| It's intended to be a tool that will prepare us for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing a lot of population growth and with that comes change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| And it's intended to act as a business plan or a guidebook for decision-makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| So the purpose of this plan is to make recommendations for land use and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| It outlines policies and guidance on how the county can guide growth into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| And again, so the creation of this plan really was the focus of this whole advance talks process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| So it will inform zoning and other small area plans and studies as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| So when you look at this future land use map, as I was comparing it to the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| you really can see much more nuance and understand what places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| even within the planned growth area, might remain more rural in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Which areas that might be more appropriate for traditional-style suburban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| which we've heard during the community and so that people still want to see that traditional suburban development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| and where we might see more intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| As I mentioned, this process has taken place over the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| It's involved a very thorough analysis of data and it's involved a lot of community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| thousands of community members in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| And so I'm going to turn it over to Christina now and she's going to walk you through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| that we took to develop the plan, the outcomes, and we're going to talk about proposed implementation strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| Awesome. Thank you guys so much for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| We're really excited to be here and we're really excited to be this close to the end of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| and getting to see this get adopted and certification actually starting to take form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| from everything that we've worked so hard with staff to continue on over the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| If you've been with us before, you've probably seen this graphic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| We just wanted to quickly revisit kind of the key phases of the advance talks process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| and what we went through to get to this point today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| So we started back in November 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Our team came down, we got to have a day with staff and Mayor Jacobs and we did a countywide tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| got to kind of explore and see everything that was kind of the hot topic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| that you all see on your agendas firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| And then we moved into starting to understand kind of what we call the state of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| That was a document that was published back in the early half of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| As you guys probably have seen, I think planning staff had nice print copies up at the front desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| that people could take if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| So as we were considering how the county wants to grow and develop in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| understanding our baseline of where we are today and some of those historic trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| were really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| And that was kind of that baseline setting for that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Our scenarios process, we'll spend quite a bit of time kind of underlying this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| because it really was the meat of the advance talks process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| It was something that was really unique to this process compared to a lot of comprehensive planning efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| that really grounded our entire process in a really heavy data-driven analysis approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| to getting to where we ended up with the implementation framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| And then all of that led into our draft plan recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| which we'll spend a really large portion of our time today kind of talking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| some of those policies and actions and recommendations coming out of advance talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| that help you guys achieve the vision of the future land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| and some of those other key components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| And here we are today with you guys talking about our adoption process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| So as Amy mentioned, it will be on your all's agenda next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| and hopefully we'll be taking it to county commission in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| So Amy did a really good job teeing this up, so I won't spend too much time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| but when we came out to the community for the first time back starting in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| we really needed to set the stage with what a comprehensive plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| We wanted them to understand that this is the blueprint that shows you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| how you can grow and how you should grow in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| but also kind of get them to start thinking about how this guides local decision making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| whether that be from your rezoning, your code amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| any of that stuff kind of should start at the heart of this bigger overarching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| comprehensive plan that you guys have, what we like to kind of refer to as a North Star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| for how you make those decisions throughout the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| And I think one of the really important things we tried to hit on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| and this is one of the things that resonates with folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| in the absence of local planning, somebody's going to make the decisions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| So this tool is the thing that allows you guys to have that kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| for lack of better terms, the control over the future and how the county grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| so that you have a little bit more input and say on how our community looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| and how we maintain that character that we're all so proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| So like all good comprehensive or general plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| we started at the highest level with a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| During some of our first community outreach efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| we came out with just blank slips of paper and told folks to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| what they love about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| I think if you guys have ever talked to anyone from here or somebody who let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| come to school here and now doesn't get to live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| there's some things that I look back on and it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| man, I really miss that about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| And we got to hear all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| And that was used and kind of aggregated together to come up with our vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| for the plan, which is a thriving county that honors its natural beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| and cultural heritage while supporting diverse people and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| Those are both just from reiterating things we heard from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| So as we went out to each group of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| everyone just told us how much they love the natural beauty of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| how they love the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| People are so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| It's just a great place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| So we wanted to honor that and kind of their desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| through our vision statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| The vision is kind of our broadest level of the kind of pyramid or umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| We wanted to take that one step further into our goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| for the Advanced Knox Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So I'm not going to read these verbatim, but I will hit on each of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| just very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Community character was one of the strongest things we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| over and over through the Advanced Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| We really wanted to make sure that we have strong places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| with distinct identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| If you go out to the community and talk to folks from PAL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| you're going to hear all about how much they love about PAL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| and what that means to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| And that was something that we heard no matter which community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| or which kind of part of the county we were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| For our conservation, kind of back to that natural beauty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| there was a strong desire from the community at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| to make sure that we're protecting our inside ridge tops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| that we're protecting our view sheds and things that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Knox County the beautiful place that it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| This is, we'll get on transportation in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| but this was really thinking about making sure that those utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| and some of those more invisible pieces that we don't always see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| to the naked eye are in place and that we're investing in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| intentionally to prepare for that future or planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| And then economic growth kind of speaks to itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| just Knox County is an attractive place and you mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| It's going to continue to be and part of that is the great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| business environment and kind of the economic opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| The workforce to support that was a big focus of conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| making sure that we continue to engage and attract folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| who can come here and work and help support that economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| And then as we get into housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| that was one of the ones that was a pretty hot topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| throughout the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| And one of the things that we kept hearing was making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| that there was a range of types and choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| You got folks graduating from UT who may not stay around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| because they can't immediately afford a $400,000 single family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| in one of our Knox County subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Or the folks that want to age in place and want something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| a little bit smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| But then also that affordability was a really big piece of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| of the underlying conversations that everyone was sharing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| And then finally, for our transportation and recreation goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| just making sure that we have that connected network and system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| that is safe and allows people the opportunities to get about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| the county, whether that be for actual transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| or via our great trails or waterways for recreational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=914)|
| 0:15:22| So, who was involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| You guys have probably heard a little bit about some of these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| at our previous meetings, but I want to just spend a little bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| talking about three key buckets on this little graph for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| We had our advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Those folks were representative of the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| It was a group of about 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| We had somebody from each of the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| We had folks from different organizations and agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| We had developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| We had planning advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| It was a large bunch of folks, and they were invited by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| to be on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| And they were kind of our, I like to call them our guinea pigs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| or our vetting board before we took anything to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| before we brought anything to commissions or councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| that we ran everything through them, let them poke holes in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| and tell us what they thought, and then we would refresh that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| refine it, and bring it up and out broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Our technical committee are the folks like staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| These are the people who know the weeds and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| They're the folks who know exactly where utilities run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| And this group was kind of on the same schedule as our advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| but they got a little bit more under the hood and helped us verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| our data sources and make sure that all of our technical analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| was found along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| And then I want to give kind of a call out to our subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| So not listed here, but we did have two standing subcommittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| throughout the AdvanceMOCS process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| One of those was a subcommittee specifically tailored to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| So they had special meetings throughout the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| and we sat down with just them, knowing the sensitivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| of some of the stuff that the schools talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| and kind of their growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| That was something we wanted them to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| with the planning team without necessarily having to broadcast that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| to the entire community through all of our advisory committee type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| And then the other big picture was our utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| You guys have a lot of utilities represented here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and each of them are in different states of advanced planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| or what they've got in terms of capacity and service today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| So we wanted to make sure, as we're considering growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| that they had a seat at the table to look at those maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| just as granularly as everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| And they could, you know, raise the red flag, say, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| whoa, whoa, whoa, like, we can't grow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| We've already explored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| There's too much rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| And they could be the ones to help us verify that throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| So Andy mentioned our public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| This was one of, I think, the shining stars of the Advanced Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| We had a really, really robust and involved public throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| We came out in three primary rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| So the first one I mentioned earlier, we just wanted to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| and learn from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| They told us what they loved about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| They marked up on maps everything that made their heart burn at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| and really just kind of started to set the stage through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Then our second round was our kind of biggest round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| That's when we brought out the choices for how the county could grow in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| We'll get into what those three options were here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| But we had a lot of really, really great guidance for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| and that feedback helped us establish our preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| which really was the foundation of the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| Then once we had that, we went back out and let folks grade our homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| We took on the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| We took on the transportation priorities and essentially asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| did we get it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Help us prioritize these investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Then we refined the plan according to that feedback as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| I think one of the really important things to take away from this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| it's not a number on here, but a number you guys should be kind of aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| is we touched base with over 4,000 folks throughout the Advanced Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| A lot of those in person, thanks to how dedicated your all staff is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| when we did that round two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| they were going out and doing what we call a meeting in a box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| where anyone who requested a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| they would go out and walk them through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| take the exercises to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| instead of making them come to us at one of our more formal public workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| at one of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| So a really big number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| and really great involvement throughout the Advanced Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| I've mentioned it quite a few times now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| but a little bit of a look into the scenario planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| When I mentioned that this is kind of the cornerstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| and unique to the Advanced Knox process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| this is one of the things that allowed us to make this a truly data-driven plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| This is a really pretty graphic to show a very boiled down version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| of a very complex modeling system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| that takes a bunch of inputs and allows us to test how we want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Through the scenario planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| we had three scenarios for how we wanted to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| One of those was what we call our business as usual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| if we just keep doing what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| And then we had two other extremes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| for how we could accommodate that same number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| but change the type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| and how we're bringing them and allowing them to grow in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| And then what we took with that was we took it to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| they got to weigh in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| our committees got to weigh in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| and then we revised it and laid it on a preferred scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| that we'll talk more in detail about here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| The other benefit of our data-driven process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| and the more in-the-weeds analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| that we got to do through the scenario planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| was look at the fiscal impact of our development decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| As you guys are aware, with every development that comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| there is property taxes, sales tax generated from additional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| additional folks spending their money in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| but there's also a cost to serve that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| whether that be the county providing stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| transportation infrastructure, parks and rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| additional public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| So with this, we were able to take those development types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and the typical tax that that type of development would generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| as well as the cost that is incurred by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| to serve that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| and look at that net revenue of that balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| to really understand the fiscal impact of the decisions we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| And we did that for all of the scenarios along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| so we could kind of make some more informed decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| And what we wanted to really highlight on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| is when we think about just doing what we're doing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| in our status quo scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| if the county changes nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| and we still have to accommodate the number of people that are coming here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| we'd be running at about a $2 million annual deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| from a budget standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| If you guys have had any interactions with somebody in county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| they tell you that they're always trying to make those dollars stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| as far as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Our development decisions are getting to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| where we're no longer going to be able to stretch those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| And I think that's one of the things that we really want to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| leave with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| that the criticality of this decision isn't just how we grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| it's how we grow and actually continue to be able to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| at the base that the county is known for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| and don't kind of have a lapse in some of those key features that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Our preferred scenario, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| of just changing our development patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| and minimizing some of that impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| allowed us to operate at an almost $5 million annual surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| over our baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| So I think it's a pretty big impactful number when you think about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| and I feel like I need to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| this is $4.8 million annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| not $4.8 million between now and 2045.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| So think about that kind of cumulative over the next 20 or so years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| as we continue to grow and develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| So between the status quo and the preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| you're showing 33,000 jobs from 2045,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| 53,000 combined between 2045 and preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I mean, what's the difference of 20,000 more jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| I imagine that's where a big part of that $4.8 million is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| So going back to that development type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| right now the way some of the development in the county is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| it's not really geared to attract development that is supportive of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| It's very geared towards more residential-style development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| And so one of the things that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| and that we're really intentional about with the preferred scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| is introducing more land-use types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| that would allow for office parks or business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| or really investing in the expansion of some of our industrial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| And even the smaller-scale stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| as we think about some of the more mixed-use type of zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| that we'll be talking about a little bit later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| allowing for more kind of shop-floor level retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| whether that be restaurants or just regular shops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| or maybe just a tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So really shifting that development equation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| to recruit more types of development types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| that are supportive of providing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| I have a lot of diversity of helping types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| how do you get some of those developers to want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| some of that mixed housing on these corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| even though you are going to allow them to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| That is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| It's something that we've heard a lot throughout this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| I will say that we did have developers on our advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| that got to kind of weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I think one of the things that they shared with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| is that if they felt like there was an appetite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| they wanted to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| So I think having a land-use plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| that encourages that and takes away the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| for as much kind of large, sprawling, single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| just having the tools in place that make that easier for them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| is something that might encourage that to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| And then some of it will be market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| just inherently what people are driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| And I think we're seeing in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| and I think you guys have probably heard all of the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| about every midsize city struggling with the missing middle type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| And as our communities continue to age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| especially as they are here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| those conversations are going to get more and more pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| and more fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| and people are going to be much more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| for the market conditions to fall in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And that may not be as hot and pressing right now today in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| but maybe it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Well, and I don't want to get too far ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| because we'll talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| kind of how the future land-use map itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| gets implemented and codified with your new UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| And I think the conversations that you want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| as the UDO is being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| is to try to identify through conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| that there are barriers that exist through policy or procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| that are pricing out developers from building that kind of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| or encouraging them to go elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| And so I think what this analysis has done really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| is highlighting the need for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| but the real work is going to come in the next couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| as you kind of get to work on the creation of a new UDO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| so that you can do more than just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| we want this, we figure out how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| from a policy or procedure standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| we can actually get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| What's a UDO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Yeah, a unified development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| So basically, the land-use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| that are wrapped around the land-use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| And we'll talk a little bit more about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| but just kind of so everyone's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| So if we do that word around, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| right now the county has subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| and a sounding code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| A UDO would kind of overhaul and break those two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| into one common umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| So it's a little bit of a rethinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| of how things are done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Any other questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| It was a great conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| All right, so the future land-use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| We're going to take a little bit of a deep dive into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| So we've told you a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| about our scenario planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| So as we went through the scenario planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| we had these conceptual scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| that were kind of the, if we do this, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| And then we vetted that with the public feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| and that's how we arrived at a draft preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| We took that and got leadership feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| through those various committees and through our staff team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and revised the preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| And then that's ultimately how we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| to our future land-use map, which is the tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| that you guys will be tasked with using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| as you kind of execute your jobs monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| for the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| So for those of you who didn't get to be around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| for our second round of engagement, just a refresher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| we had three very distinct scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Our outward bound is what I refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| as our business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| This is if we just keep growing as we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| kind of out into the county, largely single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| residential neighborhoods, with some pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| of some kind of more business and commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Our town and country was kind of like the extreme opposite end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| and that was if we really focused in on building out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| some unique kind of town center-type locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and building more distinct communities that support those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| to limit the sprawl into the kind of more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| in-between areas on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And then our on-the-road again was kind of a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| of a different play on the town and country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| but instead of focusing on more nodal-type development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| and town center format, it focused our growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Kind of not too dissimilar from what's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| in kind of the older parts of like the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| where you see everything developing along Kingston Pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| but in this case, it's smarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| I think before we move on from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I think the one thing we do want to call out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| is our starting point ended up being the town and country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| so the star ratings here are, as we went out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| they were allowed to rate it one to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and with each scenario, they were allowed to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| what they liked about it, what they hated about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| if they contained anything or meshed together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| different features, and that was our starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| but that is not, we didn't just pick that off the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| and say, all right, the public said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| town and country is your solution, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| So we're going to walk through how we moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| from that kind of more illustrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| to our preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| The star ranking, so were there any common comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| amongst, maybe all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| None of them got much votes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| So were there comments that you just didn't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| about everything, or it was just that it was permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| and people commented and didn't like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| There were a few common things across all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I think we overwhelmingly heard that continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| to support rezoning that impacted the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| and allowed the single family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| to pop up everywhere in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| regardless of context or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| was a concern we heard consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I think one of the other things that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| was people's desires to maybe be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| I don't know if the right words contain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| but to be able to do more where they live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| and not always have to drive into downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| or something over in Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| to get their daily services and needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| and to try to bring things as simple as grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| and other elements out into the county a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| so that they don't always have to drive 25, 30 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| in traffic to serve their daily and basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| There were a couple of them that were redounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| throughout, regardless of which scenario you looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| I think we also heard a lot about schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| the desire to be closer to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| and that was kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| regardless of which scenario we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| we obviously don't have control of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| here at this level as we're making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| So how do we get from those options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| to where we ultimately want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Sorry, I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| I don't know what your vision difference is, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| We can't see either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| It's okay, me either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| So with our preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| what we ask, kind of to the same thing that you just asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| is what about each of these do we want to retain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| What did we like about each of the different scenarios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| What are the elements that we would change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| if we could about each of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| And what are some things that we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| we just need to know a little bit more to confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| before we feel good about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| And those are, I'm gonna walk through kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| key elements of each of these categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| that we heard from the public in our committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| So when we thought about from the town and country scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| what it was that we wanted to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| and what the community told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| they really liked the mix of uses and close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| So to my point about folks wanting to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| take care of their daily needs kind of in their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| without having to drive through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| our more traditional commercial areas now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| that was something that we heard quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| that they liked about this scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| or made folks more inclined to choose this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| They really liked the mix of housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| that the town and country scenario provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| We heard a lot, kind of to some of my earlier points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| about the desire to have a little bit more of an in-between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| or for some folks to have the ability to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| It's just that mix of housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| was something that was really desirable to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| The defined community centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| I think Amy said it best earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| when she talked about the community pride in Nonceal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| We held our public meetings all over the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| and everyone we went to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| folks were so proud of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| that they were in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| whether it's Halls, Powell, Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| that's their community, they're proud of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| and they liked the idea that this kind of defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| and built on what we've already kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| acknowledged and recognized as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| as those kind of hubs throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| They really liked in our town and country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| that we preserved more open space in more rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| through kind of limiting that suburban sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| and starting to focus that a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| and accommodate some of the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| that that would provide with those more dense developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| or neighborhood types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| There's also a strong desire for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| to have more walkable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I think this is one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| that Amy mentioned kind of going through a global pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| When people were stuck at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| a lot of folks got out to walk and bike a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| than maybe they would have traditionally before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| and when we were coming off the hills of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| we heard a lot of desire and advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| It was so great when we could just get out and walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| and there was no traffic so it was fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| but now that everything's back to normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I can't just walk down this road anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| So thinking about how we provide things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| that are allowing them that opportunity to walk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| And then as we thought about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| that we wanted to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| there was a desire for more corridor redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| I think there's a couple of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| we probably all have in our head around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| that are kind of some sad, washed up shopping centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| along corridors that maybe we'd all love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| if something happened and they redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| and were a little bit different than they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| We heard that a lot from folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| in terms of focusing some of our energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| on those areas that are already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| they're already primed for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| and how we can funnel some of our energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| into those locations to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| some of that extra corridor mixed use type development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| More fiscally strong places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| So through that fiscal impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| for each of the place types that John and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| will go through in more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| we were able to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| just how fiscally strong that place is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| how self-supporting it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| in terms of its revenue generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| from property and sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| in versus the cost of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| So there was a desire to invest more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| in fiscally strong places throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| This one was a little bit unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| As we showed this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| this town and country concept was so notably focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| it was so focused on building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| these kind of key community hubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Folks were like, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| but I'd like to be able to get from here to here better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So one of the things that they wanted was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| we call it more origin-destination integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| That's plenary language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| That probably means nothing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| They want to get from point A to point B better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| and they want more interconnectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| between those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| so it doesn't just feel like these isolated islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| So in that category of what do we want to confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I've mentioned our utilities and schools groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| quite a bit through that subcommittee work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| We have a preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| We don't want to put that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| if the utilities can't serve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| We don't want to put it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| if the county doesn't have any intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| of supporting school enrollment in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| So we had really detailed conversations with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| where we rolled up maps and fleets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| and kind of gathered around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| and let them poke holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| based on what they know in our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| and we made modifications to the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| based on the feedback they provided us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| We wanted to make sure that any changes we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| to the preferred scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| from that town and country scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| was still fiscally viable and balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| We wanted to make sure that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| deviate too far from that housing mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| and then we really wanted to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| on some key locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| in terms of that rural preservation component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| that has been served before into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| as well as, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| that the centers and corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| really was the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| So where we landed was with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| revised preferred scenario map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| This was the kind of iteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| of all of those kind of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| what we asked ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| how we shifted things around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| to try to get more at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| what the community told us they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| through that round of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| I think one of the key things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I talked about this being data-driven process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| For each of those prior scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| when we did go out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| we were able to report to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| in kind of a report card format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| how those scenarios performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| against our goal areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| So in terms of community character conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| we were able to report out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| where they feel on that scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| of supporting it versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| not being as supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| And we wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| that when we got to our preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| we were able to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| how it stacked up against those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| identified by the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| So for our preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| there was a greater emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| on centers and corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| allowing us to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| hone in on that community character component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Conservation, less land consumed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| less impervious surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| due to just the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| and development that we were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Continued trend of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| that we're growing within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| our existing service areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| from an infrastructure standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Making sure we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| a good mix of job growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| and centers and corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| to allow for that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| delta of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| to come to the unincorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| portions of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Making sure that we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| a good mix of single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| attached and multi-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| so that we get people that choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| and the affordability points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| they need to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| call the county home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Maintaining our connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| focusing on those corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| between those orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| and destination points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| and then making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| that we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| a really strong emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| on our access to parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| and trails and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| that folks need to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| have fun with their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| and recreate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| So how we took this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| from the scenario itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| to the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| The future land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| is a lot more granular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| and nuanced than our scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I think Sheldon mentioned this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| when we did our scenario process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Those were 25-acre hexagons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| So it was a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| of a blurrier version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| We didn't want to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| going to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| with something that's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| here's exactly what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| with your parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| So those 25-acre hexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| allowed us to test policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| and decisions at a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| kind of higher level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| but still enough granularity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| to see what was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| As we moved into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| the future land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| we were able to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| taking those hexagons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| and turning them into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| the place types that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Jonathan's going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| And through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| what we did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| we ended up mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| those kind of place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| or land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| to kind of more natural features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| whether that be streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| and our lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| or natural boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| between the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| or whether that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| kind of more natural features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| like rivers, waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| So we smoothed those boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| got a little bit deeper into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| But as we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| we kind of magnified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| 10,000 times the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| from what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| the scenario planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| to what would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| kind of your all-sky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| document in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| We took a really strong look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| at what's existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| So some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| are newly built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| newly developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| so we made sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| reflected those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| But then in cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| where there might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| or things with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| high redevelopment potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| we worked within that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And then back to our friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| at the utility providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| once we had that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| blush of the map together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| we're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| hey, tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| is this real?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Can we support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Are there places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| where we need to dial it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Or are there places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| you're planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| utility expansions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| that we can maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| be a little bit more proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| in providing some intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| that will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| to be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| by those locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| So that's how we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| to a future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| And here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| our new future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| So you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| kind of the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| in those nice fuzzy scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| and what we were at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| when we were at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| a 25-acre hex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| versus where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| And you can kind of see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| the intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| of where some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| different land use types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| are placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| I think one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| that we want to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| hone in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| with our future land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| this is really your tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| for implementing the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| There's lots of tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| outlined in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| but this is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| the cornerstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| of the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And what it's intended to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| is identify kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| the range of land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| or development types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| that are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| in these different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| And it's not intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| that you guys go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| and make this happen tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| This is something that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| will be implemented over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| whether that be through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| kind of public and private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| in the development decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| that get made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| by independent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| or whether that's things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| that get realized over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| through some of these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| and actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| that we're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| in terms of some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| that you guys will be making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| to videos and zoning codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| In any of the tool sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| that we have at our disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| is there a map like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| that is either dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| so you can isolate these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| or layered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| There is a dynamic map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| of the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| It's available on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| the Advanced NOx website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| depending on what you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| to layer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| I think eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| this will be put into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| the normal KGIS means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| and you could layer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| other things on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I don't think you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| It's too early to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Do you have a specific example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| of what you're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| you'd want to be able to do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Mainly just being able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| in terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| because it's a color set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| that you're really using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| to be able to isolate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| to be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| how these things work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| to be able just to turn on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| and turn off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| each of these components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| to see like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| how much of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| is there really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| and not have it blurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| with some of the other colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Just to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| have a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| of each of these components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| how much there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| or how much there isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| in a fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| where you can turn them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| and turn them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| So each place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| you have to isolate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| We don't currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| on the future land use map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| One thing looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| that I see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| the more commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| still look very linear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| as if we were taking the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| not the town and place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| but the next one over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Is there other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| to allow for more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| in those corridor areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| larger radiuses around those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Because really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| in a lot of these scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| I guess specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| the east side of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| If you were to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| any mixed use on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| you're still driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| a couple miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| from one side to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| So there's not a lot of walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Is there any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| why there's not more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| clusters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| When you look at the different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| we'll get into the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| I think that might be a good segue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| into talking specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| about place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| because the corridor mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| the town center mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| as Christina was touching on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| there was definitely an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| in different types of place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| and not just focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| commercial or landmark corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| but allowing mixed uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| in the modern town center type development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| I think that was more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| an intentional focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| of this preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Also you can think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| trying to balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| those different interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| because we definitely heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| on the east side of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| there was a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| in preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| And so trying to be very thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| about where you might put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| additional growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| commercial growth specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| and really focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| those in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| because we've not only heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| we've heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| through the various efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| that we have put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| to get this part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I think one thing to add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| is it may not be as obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| on this static,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| really big doubt map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| but one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| when you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| those more walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| compact growth categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| those can actually happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| in a smaller footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| in terms of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| that they require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| because those are the places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| where we're going to build up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| So they may not be as obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| when you're looking at a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| at this scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| because we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| in a more confined footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| and kind of bring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| from around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| and it may just not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| as evident if they're on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| if that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| because they are more compact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| I think the scale definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| has a lot to do with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| on this map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| because it shows in the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Well I think lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| is supposed to arrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| and this is a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| stopping point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Lunch is supposed to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| at 11.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| We can keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Let's jump into the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| because I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| they'll take too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| When we think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| the place types though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| that these aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| These aren't the regulatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| kind of pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| that you're implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Instead what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| with the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| we've got 13 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| paint brushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| that we're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| to paint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| the study area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| and as we paint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| the study area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| with these place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| we're hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| you can kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| blur your eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| and start to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| that Christina talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| a little bit earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| from those scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| what we want to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| what we want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| what we want to confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| is starting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| reinforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| The place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| too are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| you know in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| we talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| they're describing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| places that already exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| in the study area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| and other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| they're reimagining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| the existing uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| place type palette| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| So we've got 13 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| and we've kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| organized them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| into these buckets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| so you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| the walkable compact growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| the suburban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| kind of these special districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| or other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| and so in a lot of respects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| if you exclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| the other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| are organized around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| kind of the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| that we're hoping to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| evoke as we create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| these places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| and ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| So just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| going through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=2803)|

| 0:55:12| or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| distinction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| The corridor commercial really is along your major transportation corridors, and it's capturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| the shopping centers and the big box stores, and it's very much auto-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3319)|
| 0:55:28| And then the last one in this bucket of suburban place types is business parks, and these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| just your office parks, your employment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| So nothing super fancy or out of the realm with the business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| And so as we think about the next bucket, we get into more of the rural place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3348)|
| 0:55:57| The first one being rural conservation, if you think about some of the things that Christina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| talked about a little bit earlier, about the things that we heard routinely, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| that there's an appreciation for the rural nature and the natural resources, the natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| places that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| And so the rural conservation is really just kind of the future land use maps way of identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| those forested areas, the ridges, the wetlands, and saying these are worthy of preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3384)|
| 0:56:31| Not to say that no growth will occur in the rural conservation areas, but if they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| kind of as you can see here in the graphic on the bottom right, it's a clustered design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| where the lots themselves are small, but they're small so that we're preserving more of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| The rural crossroads commercial is simply these little commercial nodes, a lot of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| probably already exists, that occur at where two roads out in the rural areas are meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| So those rural crossroads are where you're starting to see or currently see some commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| activity kind of out in the county a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| We've got civic and institutional, and I think it's important to note here that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| we talk about the schools and the universities, all of the civic uses, that the design of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| these places likely vary significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| If you think about a single site versus a university campus or a secondary school, kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3462)|
| 0:57:52| of the look and feel of it could vary quite a bit, but at the end of the day, it's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| civic and institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| And the last two, we don't get into a lot of detail of the land use mix or the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| mix or the form attributes for these two, because they're truly kind of special districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| And so you can see mining and heavy industrial and parks and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| And so while those two things are very, very different from a land use and form standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| there's not as much nuance as that we have to cover in the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| I'll pause there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Any questions about ... I know I went through those last few relatively quickly, but I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| to pause and then to invite and see if you all have any questions you want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| Did you just skip over rural living, or was that just ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| You said we started with rural conservation, but I may have just misheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| I guess there wasn't a slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| That was, I guess, unintended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| But yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Rural living is just the least-kissed kind of residential place that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Mainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| I hope you all have it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| So it's in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| On page 37 of rural living, and that's primarily as open space, single family, large law, residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| it would be reflective of some of the main ads, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| It might not be active ads, but ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| Is it possible at this juncture, not this bit, but before it comes to us to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3565)|
| 0:59:34| definitions applied for the transportation primary and secondary, what those are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| supposed to be saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Just defining what we mean by primary and what we mean by secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| I think that that's clarification that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Are there specific ways to protect or prevent development in a rural conservation, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| in ... This may come later, but with the slope, hillside protection, like is that coming into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3597)|
| 1:00:07| play, or ... I noticed you mentioned the smaller lots and clusters, but I guess that ... I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| can understand that on a site where you've got the 60 acres and you put everything in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| one spot, but what if someone's trying to develop a series of two acre lots, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| they have the same limitations, or ... I'm just curious how we can actually protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| rural areas with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| Is there strong protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| I think that's where the land development codes will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| There's actually a good segway to the campus where you're briefing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| I was going to say, the hillside ridge top line will still be used as a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| As you all know, it is not codified as a dam, but it would still be used as a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| Could it be codified as this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| It's not currently proposed to be codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| We do have an action item that we'll cover in a minute that talks about performing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| analysis of these protections, and it's almost like revisiting it, but it isn't codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| as a land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| On the traditional neighborhood, I'm struggling to think of an existing traditional walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| neighborhood in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I could find it even more challenging to even imagine one moving forward, because those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| are typically kind of center city, on grids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| How do we speak to that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Do we have any that I'm not thinking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| Then how in the world would we ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Tim, we were over here thinking that maybe that was Elkhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| It doesn't exist now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Well, you have to cross a major road to even get to the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| I guess that's a bit maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| Sorry to interrupt you, but ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Is it developed on a grid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| I thought they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| It's a mix of mountain heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| I think that brings up the bigger point that I may have kind of glossed over when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| introducing the place types, is that they're really ... Some of these in traditional neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| and kind of the town center probably, especially the walkable mixed use place types, they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| necessarily exist today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| I think that there's an appreciation from kind of the engagement that has occurred throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| this process and the technical analysis that is underlayed to the overall plan, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| those types of places are desirable if they're located in the right areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| When we think about this plan being a 2045 or a 2050 plan, we're trying to set the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| that these types of places probably should exist in the future, even if it's hard for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| us right now to imagine more of them, which they really could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| I think we're having to add on to that the implementation of those isn't going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| as easy as grabbing a big grid-filled site and putting out a single family subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| A lot of those may be achieved through kind of, as we're thinking of this as a 2045 plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| redevelopment or kind of the turning over of and adaptation of our city stuff into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| areas that have been identified that already have stuff there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| It just may not be the highest and best use of when that does turn over hands or somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| buys it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| That would be the opportunity to really think about it through more redevelopment initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| because likely a lot of these kind of more specialized things that we're introducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| aren't going to be things where we've got to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| We can just go by 138.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Maybe outside of the Belltown situation, it's not going to be quite that easy to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| it in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| This is sort of connected to what Logan was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| Seeing as the hillside protection is just a guide and not codified, are there things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3857)|
| 1:04:27| that this body can do or your research can do that provides some type of scaffolding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3867)|
| 1:04:38| guidance to make this vision come to life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| If you want to preserve these areas, it would be recommended that there be dot, dot, dot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| so that there's sort of a scaffolding to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| I will say that the rural conservation was very strategically applied to a lot of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| hillside and ridgetop areas because sans that and the hillside and ridgetop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| not being codified, it could become anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| It could be completely flat and then become a suburban neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| It could be a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| What have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| By overlaying the rural conservation, that is one way to protect it a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| without there being a codified tool as kind of sure cast what the hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| protection is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| That's the thinking behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Yeah, that was the thinking behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| It was kind of why that was intentionally introduced as a new concept into the advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| NOx comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| And this is jumping ahead a little bit, but if you look at the, on page 52 of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| and 57, for example, it talks about, you know, except for 57, to ensure the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| sensitive to this character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| And there's a couple policies here that are calling out additional analysis themes, assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| creating new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| The same with number seven on page 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| So, creating laws, large law, agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| So, this gets into the next step, which is we need to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| How do we make policy work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| Yeah, to actually implement a plan like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| So, you all should have this kind of worksheet or table in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3978)|
| 1:06:28| What we're trying to kind of communicate with this is that you have place types, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| And then you currently have a set of zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| The intent, as we'll get into, the way to implement the future land use map is to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| of reimagine your land development regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| And so, what this table is doing is kind of showing you the crosswalk between your existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| zoning, the future land use place types, and then ultimately can be revisited once the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| new Unified Development Ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| And so, on the left side, we've got those 13 kind of future land use place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| And across the top, you've got your existing zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| And this is really kind of providing a guide to show kind of the relationship between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| place types and the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| And so, some of them are directly related and some of them are only partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| Did you have anything that you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Well, I guess I will add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| So, this is one tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| One thing that this plan hopefully moves forward that we'll do as another tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| I hope you all are very familiar with our land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| This replaces our land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| But what we want to do is take that table and pull this information into it to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| it a more useful tool for you all as well as our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| You guys have heard us say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| It is a comprehensive land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| We've spent a lot of time on the land use component of that because it is probably one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| of the bigger and more complex things that we've had to navigate through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| But the transportation and infrastructure piece of it is just as important and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| to make sure we're bringing that alongside the land use decisions that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| at the county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| So, I've got some big numbers on screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| I think the first thing we want to share with you guys is that as we made our transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| decisions for the advanced cost process, we did what we in the planner world like to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| financially constrained our list, or to put it kind of more, kind of rural people language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| balanced our checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| The county doesn't have an English budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| There's actually pretty strict rules on how transportation dollars get spent, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| that be from the federal or state sources, as well as some of the county sources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| they use to leverage those federal and state sources through cash and funds and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| So, we did a pretty deep dive into the county's CIP all the way back to about 2004, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4150)|
| 1:09:18| I think, and tried to do an assessment of how they were spending their money, what types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| of projects they were funding, kind of the fluctuation year over year of whether their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| CIP was bigger or smaller, whether it grew, whether they had to dial back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| And using that, we were able to create revenue projections of what we think, kind of given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| what we know today, that the anticipated revenues for transportation in the county would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| So, those are the numbers you're seeing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| We like to think about that in our world in what we call funding bands, such as our more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| near-term, mid-term, and long-term timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| And once we kind of, you know, looking at our transportation recommendations, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| span the gamut of anything from safety projects, capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| There's a project type here that you guys may have heard about in one of your earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| meetings, but we're calling it modernization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| As everyone knows, a lot of our county roads are really rural and substandard today, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| they don't necessarily need to be blown out into a giant four-lane, boulevard-type road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| So, we recommended, in many of these cases, modernization to bring them up to a more current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| design standard with, you know, 11- to 12-foot travel lanes, shoulders, and in some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| cases, where the land use permits, perhaps some sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| So, you'll see those there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| And then, the multimodal layer that you're seeing, that's primarily the county's focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| on the greenways across the county and building out and connecting the rest of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| But, with this, we lovingly, as a project team, called it our universe of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| and if anyone's been in the space of government for a while, we know that our needs far outweigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| the amount of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| So, you'll see here, indicated by the yellow dots, those projects that we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| able to fund with the revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| We let all of the projects in because they will be important at some point or time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| we wanted to allow the county to remain flexible, and for some reason, there's a great grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| That need is still documented, and we're trying to go after that to fund some of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| that may not be reasonably funded with the sources they have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| So, just taking that step and making sure that the money that we have in the bank and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| the projects that we've identified can actually reasonably be implemented in the timeframe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| of our advanced NOx plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| How can we get you more money at the bank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| They really get folks at TPO and TDOT, get really good at writing grants to the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| and raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, like, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Yeah, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| I think all this comes down to, I know we're doing as good as we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| So, we don't have enough money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| It really comes down to the tax piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| We're seeing a lot of communities, cities and counties leveraging referendums just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| fund transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| So, even if it's not a wholesale sales tax or property tax, like a finite next seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| years, we're going to accept this, and we're going to get this list of 12 to 15 projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| That's not a very popular opinion, but it is one of the most likely ways to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| No, I think, I mean, because by far, as a commission, I know everybody can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| it, that's the number one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| It's about zoning, it's about densities, but at the same time, it's about what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| It's getting worse because people are moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Jim, I mean, you're in front, and I don't know this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| I'm just totally asking you from a budget perspective in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| I mean, do you know what your budget is for expanding yearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| I mean, like on these projects here that they've identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| On a capital budget, we have seen slight increases the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| I think five years ago, we were around 12 to 13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| This past year, we were up around 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Our operating budgets, I think, have increased probably consistent percentage-wise with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| So, like for this year, we got $7 million in resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| Probably five years ago, we had probably five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| So, there is increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| It's just, obviously, percentage-wise, smaller than what maybe we'd all like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| I mean, I think a lot of people view it in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| It's a cardinal urge, and it's like, we've always operated under, okay, build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| We're going to have to say, build a new subdivision or build a new commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| It generates taxes, and that allows us to improve the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| But I think people are starting to now say, well, we'd rather have the roads improved before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| There's not enough money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Well, I mean, I don't know how the budget works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I'm not into capital management or into politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| But it's obvious it's not being appropriated in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| And I'm not into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| But in my own opinion, which I'll expect to hear, that's not being given correctly for this county and the revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4458)|
| 1:14:28| But that has nothing to do with you all either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| But if we're going to do this, we definitely have to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Because I like the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| I really like the plan, but I see hiccups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| And I think that's a really interesting point, because one of the things through that fiscal impact analysis that we got to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| we did get to look at whether or not those developments pay for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| And there's a slide in there with kind of the arrows that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| You can see clearly which of those developments pay for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| So our mindset of just like if development comes, we'll eventually use that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| Some of those developments will never pay for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| And that's just the nature of what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| But we have to have them, or we don't have housing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| So just thinking about kind of that balancing action trade-off is something that we're trying to tackle from multiple avenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| whether it be through what we're talking about here, the transportation-specific revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| or bringing that development mix more into balance so that we do have more self-sustaining developments happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| that do generate the tax revenue to pay for themselves and the improvements that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| So if I'm understanding you correctly, more like rural ones are probably going to be the ones that aren't paying themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| They're pretty neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| It's actually our more traditional suburban residential that doesn't pay for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| There's a lot of street centerline miles that go into those that the county ends up taking over and having to pave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| And it's very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| And that doesn't even account for the things like drainage or sidewalks or anything else that's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| I mean, we're doing the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| We're working it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| I mean, that's the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| But we aren't doing good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| It's not due to anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| It's due to the amount of money that we make in order to accomplish our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| No, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| So this is something that's a little bit new that we've been doing for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| but we're formalizing a little bit more through the comprehensive land-use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| And that is the concept of these transportation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| So these are programs that have a budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| I think the numbers are in your plan that's printed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| But they're not tied to a specific capital concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| So when we say pedestrian improvement, that's not necessarily tied to a sidewalk on Fish Road from point A to point B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| It is something that the county will have a program for annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| And as a development goes in and there's a critical gap that they need to connect it to get to the next corridor commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| or a critical gap that they need to connect it to a park or a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| this is where this bucket of funding will come in to allow them that flexibility to be able to more nimbly respond to some of those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| It can also be served for some pedestrian safety, whether that's a request for crosswalks or pedestrian kind of signal heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| This is kind of the conduit for some of those smaller-scale improvements that come up throughout each year for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| Our spot safety projects, the county and the TPO recently participated in our regional safety action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| and that had a ton of kind of low-cost safety measures in it that would complement the work that the county's already been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| I interned for noon for three years, so I used to build the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| It's like, hey, there's, like, framing down, and I can't see to turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| Those types of improvements that simple as it sounds cost money to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| You've got to send the crew out there. They've got to have the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| So this is the conduit for providing some of those more kind of really low-cost, have-to-get-them-done-tomorrow safety improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| whether that be adding all-way stops, adding advanced warning signs, clearing sight-distance problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| or in some isolated cases, adding some extra, like, shoulder widths so that we prevent some of those runoff-the-road crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| that are really popular and are more powerful for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| Traffic signal modernization, this was pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| The county maintains a little over 80 traffic signals, and those cost money to operate and upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| That technology, just like the technology in your pockets, goes out of date pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| So for them to make sure that they're operating the most efficient and connected system they can, we have to set aside the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| And then these last two here are thinking more in terms of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| So the county does have an assessment going on to kind of understand the status of the bridges and culverts across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| Many of those are getting really old and outdated and will need improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| So this sets aside a lot of money for when that assessment is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| The county can strategically go and improve those bridges and culverts to make sure that they're good for the next 75 to 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| And we were going to mention it, but our maintenance priorities, that's really where we capture the county's repaving efforts that they do annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| Whether that be what they do with their own money or their partnership with CDOT on the state-aid roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| So just a little set aside that helps fund kind of the daily operations of everything that the engineering and public works team has to go through each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4758)|
| 1:19:31| So something a little bit unique, and this spawned mostly from the transportation discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| If you look at that future land use map, there's probably some things that we see where we're recommending some place types in areas that today we have a hard time envisioning that they're going to be able to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4777)|
| 1:19:49| So part of our plan has recommended a couple of areas for future study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| Those four up there on your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| And with these future studies, we'll be envisioning, if you guys were around a couple of years ago for the Hardin Valley Mobility Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| where they got to take a really deep dive into the Hardin Valley community and do some really detailed traffic data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| and modeling to understand kind of more granularly some of those improvements at a left turn lane here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| Some of the stuff that if we weren't looking at a countywide level, we don't have the data at this scale to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| We'd probably blow the county's budget to try to analyze the whole county to that extent at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| So these were kind of hot spots that today there's not a huge need showing up in the traditional data sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| There's not huge crash problems that are clearly identified via trends on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| There's not traffic reports saying this area is super congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| But we know from what we heard from the community that as growth pressures continue in these areas, those things are going to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| and they're already starting to be visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| So on the hills of the comprehensive plan, we have recommended that staff initiate small area plans of these four areas to take that deep dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| But some of our areas that are already more developed in the county have had the opportunity to do so already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| So almost an hour and a half ago, there was a slide that talked a little bit at a high level about what a comprehensive plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4860)|
| 1:21:16| And one of the words that was on that slide was the plan that you have in front of you needs to be a playbook for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4876)|
| 1:21:24| And I think the policies and actions that we're going to introduce right now is kind of our way of making sure that the document itself is a playbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4884)|
| 1:21:37| that it sets forward a course for implementation, even if that course could be windy and difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4897)|
| 1:21:46| But it also sets forth some accountability for staff and for you all on the commission to make sure that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4906)|
| 1:21:55| the actions that we take surrounding development decisions and growth decisions are constantly leading us toward that vision statement that you saw at the beginning of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4915)|
| 1:22:06| And so what we thought we would do is just kind of tell you how it's organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| We'll use a few examples to help you understand how it's related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| But at the end of the day, there's these eight goals, and those are the long-term desired outcomes for the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4938)|
| 1:22:27| Then you've got a set of policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| There's 23 policies in this document, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| And then there's, I think, 81 actions that support the 23 policies that help us implement the eight goals that lead us toward that one vision statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4952)|
| 1:22:43| And so there's a layer, there's a hierarchy for how the plan is organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| And I certainly don't want to spend the few minutes that we have kind of going one by one through all 81 of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| particularly because I think depending upon the hats that you all wear kind of outside of this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| there's certain sets of policies and certain sets of actions that you all are just naturally drawn towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| And I think you probably want to invest your time and your expertise in those specific policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4986)|
| 1:23:16| Just like the place types, just like the place type palette refers to some areas that exist in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| and some are completely new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| So it's true with the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Some of the policies are going to reinforce the current direction that the county is taking and has long taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5008)|
| 1:23:38| Other policies are going to be a shift in direction, again, so that we can lead toward those eight goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| and ultimately kind of get us closer to that overarching vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| And so you'll see this table on page 50 and 51 in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| And across the top are the eight goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| And then you'll see on this slide 14 of the 23 of the policies listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5039)|
| 1:24:07| And this is our way of kind of holding ourselves accountable to suggest that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| which of these policies are achieving which of the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| And so the dark green that you see there suggests that that policy directly advances that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| And if there's a gray circle, it's not directly advancing it, but it's certainly supporting or reinforcing that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5064)|
| 1:24:35| And then you get into kind of each of the actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| So each of those 23 policies has a subset of actions that are pushing us in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| Again, I'm just going to talk a little bit about a small collection of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| The first, you can see the policy there, improve the predictability and transparency of the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| Goodness, wouldn't that be nice, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| And the actions to support that policy, that first one is a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| We've talked about it quite a few times today, and that's to create a new unified development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| And I think as you go through and you read all of the policies and actions that follow 1.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| you'll see that there's a triple down effect that this first policy or this first action has kind of throughout the overall implementation strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5118)|
| 1:25:27| A lot of the things that we say that the county needs to do to move forward points back to making sure that we get that unified development ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5127)|
| 1:25:37| Luckily, you all on the commission are going to be involved in that process kind of going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5137)|
| 1:25:46| One more on that one that we did want to call out, just as a fair warning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| is there will be one of our recommendations to provide training for the elected and appointed officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| That's you guys in this room with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| So Amy's team will be putting together kind of a more robust training on the heels of the hopeful adoption of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| that kind of walks you guys through the nitty gritty and fine grained of how you will use the updated future land use map with life types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5164)|
| 1:26:12| and kind of what that will look like for your all's operation moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| Okay, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| So two is to ensure that development is sensitive to existing community character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| And to just prove that I'm not a liar, you can see kind of the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Update or create bumper or transition standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| Update landscaping, lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Provide protection for the ridges used in open spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Create standards to encourage the preservation of open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| At the end of the day, all of those things need to be represented in that PBO that's forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| We jump ahead to number four in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| That's to incentivize walkable mixed use centers, corridors, and neighborhood service nodes as the preferred form of commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5215)|
| 1:27:05| And I think the realists in some of us can recognize the challenge that comes with trying to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5225)|
| 1:27:17| But it's important if the overall future land use map is trying to move us in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5237)|
| 1:27:24| especially as it relates to commercial development, we need to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| And we do that with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| And then certainly you can see that very first action, 4.1, creating new zone districts to implement mixed use place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5253)|
| 1:27:41| I think there's an understanding just in that one statement that our current codes and regulations are ill-equipped to deliver us the future land use map that we put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5261)|
| 1:27:55| And then the last one that we just wanted to highlight today is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| And so that's on page 59 of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| This is coordinating infrastructure improvements with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| And I think to your point, it gets at the cost to serve, the return on investment that we're receiving long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5291)|
| 1:28:20| I'll call your attention in particular to 9.3 here, and that's focus growth in areas already served by adequate infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5300)|
| 1:28:30| And so I think that there's, again, an acknowledgment there that through the actions that you all take as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| as the county commission takes over time, that we need to do so in the interest of the long term fiscal health of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5319)|
| 1:28:51| We are getting really close to the end of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| But still continue to chime in with any questions you've got along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| And we'll try to reserve some minutes here at the end for any more overarching questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| Just remind me that we're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| So how we get this done, Jonathan's talked a lot about our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| One thing you'll notice on the pages in your report that Jonathan covered, it doesn't say who should do the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| And we all know when you take CPR training, the first thing you have to do is point to somebody and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| hey, you, or it's not going to get done in terms of that first call to 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| The same thing goes for our actions in delivering the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| So as you kind of get towards the end of your document on page 71, that action list is summarized kind of in brief here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| There's a little less granularity in terms of the action itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| But the most important part of this is that it says who the lead entity is for taking that next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| So when we think about creating our Unified Development Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| we have clearly outlined that Engineering and Public Works will take the lead on getting that initiated on behalf of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| And then that the supporting entities will be the planning group, the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| and that's kind of the way it will get delivered and achieved as we think about implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| So that is there for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| I will take a minute while we're still on this slide before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| And the next slide will help us kind of think about this kind of in wholesale view of the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| But this is something that will be revisited annually and staff will track their performance and kind of progress on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5420)|
| 1:30:28| These things will find their way into your own work plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| So you're not out of this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| Some of these will be trickling down your way to kind of help tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| So you'll see that kind of throughout your daily practice of what you do and how you get things moved through planning commission, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5438)|
| 1:30:48| And staff will kind of report back on this annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| They'll update that status, whether it's kind of in work, underway, something future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| They'll also revisit whether or not things are irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Maybe you've taken that first step of studying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| It's like this just isn't going to work for us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| So those things can be updated along the way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| So kind of a big piece of this puzzle is what we're referring to as our plan management cycle or how often you update or amend the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5466)|
| 1:31:17| This is one of the nice little graphics in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| A couple of things to highlight here before we move on to the next slide is there will be that kind of annual monitoring of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5481)|
| 1:31:30| This will be something that Jim's team should reference when they put together their CIP every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| This should be something that as planning staff are going through development approvals and rezoning, they're referencing back to the comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| So it'll be used year round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| But there's a couple of kind of key inflection points that we want to think through and talk about with you guys today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| One of those things, how often you should update your comprehensive plan and that future land use map that's within your comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| We know that URL's current process is monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| That looks like skin crawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| We don't work with many communities who update their plans that regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| I think there's a couple of reasons why we want to think about that being less frequent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| One is maintaining the integrity of our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| I think if we're updating it monthly, it starts to lose some of the integrity of that big picture that we established and respected, put together with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| And I think another kind of couple of pieces of that is as we're going through it, it doesn't give us a chance monthly to understand our progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5543)|
| 1:32:33| or take a kind of more holistic look at the implementation of the progress that we're making toward the vision and goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| So our recommendation through this is an annual update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| With the exception of these first two years, we're recommending that staff do a biannual revisit and update because it is so new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| There is a lot of changes, so a little bit more frequent here at the beginning just as you're getting used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| You're figuring out the keys and what's working and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| But then work our way towards only updating it annually moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| And then the last thing I want to hit on here is that in addition to those kind of annual monitoring and revisiting every five years or maybe more frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5585)|
| 1:33:14| maybe it's three years, maybe one year at seven, take a more holistic look and do a more wholesale minor update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| And similar to how we do it at the main stock, but please don't wait 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| At that 10-year mark, do a more wholesale revisit of your comprehensive plan to make sure that it's still tracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| When you said that you're on a monthly cycle for updating the plan, you're referring to the plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Yes, you guys are on a monthly cycle for plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| And we're recommending that other than these first two years, you move to a once-a-year plan amendment cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| So the way that that would look practically is that it would mean that the only time a developer was able to bring forth a project that would have a plan amendment component would be once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5628)|
| 1:34:02| Is that how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| You can still do rezonings and stuff along the way, but it won't get reconciled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| You can do rezonings, but in terms of a plan amendment itself would not be able to be made on that monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| So they need to look at this matrix, like what is allowed currently within that place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5659)|
| 1:34:28| Again, I'm just trying to make sure I had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| Right now, if there's a development desire, because our plan is so out of date, this is just where we have found ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5674)|
| 1:34:42| But someone will come with a development and it requires these plan amendments to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| And our body, along with the county commission, has to decide about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| And in the recommendation world, that would not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| That developer would be, if they really needed to modify the plan to make something that was just so phenomenal happen, then they would need to wait until that one period to bring that forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5698)|
| 1:35:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| So it's not unlike how in the city, we only have four amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| That's a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| But let me say, you said if they had something really unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| But we have other tools in the zoning code, so like the plan development tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| So that is another tool that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| What if there's an error in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| Is that what the period that you were describing, that because it's so new, that in the first two years there would be greater flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5733)|
| 1:35:43| I think one thing that we're leaving out that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| So with the new UDO update, hopefully by introducing these extra zoning districts and extra development flexibility in what they can build, you need to do those less often anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5745)|
| 1:35:54| Hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Right now, your development code is so limited that we're seeing that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| Not to mention that the future real use map is 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| But when you think about adding in all of those walkable mixed use types and them now being applicable things, hopefully people are having to ask for plan amendments less frequently in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5762)|
| 1:36:13| Because we've given them a greater palette to work from at that starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| And the biannual, as you guys know, the zoning code hasn't been updated yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| So that's to help you bridge that gap between when you do have that new slate of options to give them more choice in the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5782)|
| 1:36:32| Understanding now what that recommendation is matches what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| So I asked this question at some previous presentation of material as it was at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| Because there was a comment about plan amendments and how we saw them with such frequency and how this would make that not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5803)|
| 1:36:51| Which I think most of the commissioners here, not all, but many of us are new enough that that's the only rule we have known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| Is that every month there are all these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| And one of your colleagues said that we should only be seeing those really once or twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| So what you're suggesting is consistent with what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| And I understand that this is probably concerning because it is a change in how we have handled this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| But keep in mind, I think it was just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| So three years of time and effort has been put into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| A lot of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| And so there's an expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| So if you are amending it on a monthly basis, you're basically like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| I mean, it typically diminishes the effectiveness of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| And it also diminishes all that public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| So when you are thinking about this particular piece of it, think about it in that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| Maybe there's another conference we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| But also just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| So much time and effort has been put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| And going forward, our intention is, and it would be codified in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| that we would be updating this on a much more regular basis than we've updated any of our plans in the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| No, it is something that we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| I mean, if there's a mistake in the plan somewhere, I mean, every one of those lines isn't going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| Or if there's a new road built, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| And yet, okay, you can't apply for a year to make...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| I mean, even if somebody builds a brand new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| I mean, that's the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| That type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Because I've dealt with it in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| It is somewhat punitive in the city trying to line up your application with your landowner, with the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5910)|
| 1:38:38| And you have to, they say, oh well, you can't do that because you can't even apply for a sector change or one year plan change for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5918)|
| 1:38:47| And now you're saying for a full 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| I'm just voicing a concern seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| And keep in mind that so you can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| So this is revisited every six months for the first two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| We're seeing some trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Like this is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Like people are not able to do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| And also that it meets the intent of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Those things can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| I mean, we talked about, you know, even with the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| You know, where we put all that stuff in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Where you were talking about it being living documents and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| That shut it down for four years of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| You know, I mean, I just see it being problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| Only do it once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Why couldn't you make an exception if you can demonstrate there's an error in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| That you can update that at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| Also, I was going to say, could we make like a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| And we have an exception, let's say like annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| We have an exception and then maybe we can provide some standards to meet that exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| The Planning Commission can then be able to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| So it's not just like we can change it on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| But if we're presented with the right circumstances, we can make an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| And our current second plan is, I mean, most of the amendments we're seeing now are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| trying to go from MDR or MDR or, I mean, they're very density focused, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| All of our second plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| There are a lot of them aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| This doesn't have density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| Well, but by default it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| If you read the, you know, it's, I forgot the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Suburban, you know, I mean, it only is going to support certain types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| You know, but if there's a scenario where, okay, maybe multifamily where you can only go from LDR to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| It's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| For a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6048)|
| 1:41:03| I mean, I'm understanding it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| I feel more comfortable because it's consistent with what the previous colleague said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6065)|
| 1:41:13| We should be seeing it a couple times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| And if we have a built-in, to your point, John, this is a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| For those first two years, we have the opportunities, these windows to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| Like, if there's something that we see as this trend, that things are out of whack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| we have the opportunity to amend and make that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Because something wasn't said as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| I mean, that feels like there's some safety gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| We've had errors in the plan discovered for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| I would just want that the errors in the plan be designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| I guess I don't see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| There can be ways of saying, you know, if you demonstrate an error in the plan in these ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| I think that's what Katie was saying about putting an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Yeah, we just put an exception category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| I agree that we shouldn't review this every two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| But if we had a category where we're presented with this perfect circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| where this new road and this development just don't make any sense, but we want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| we could then see whether that proposed plan meets a list of categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| that would then grant an exception for us to be able to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| In certain situations, we're not on the fly, but we have a set kind of guideline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| I understood what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| In theory, I think that's a commendable way to try and address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| I think I'm reflecting on the years of service on the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| and where I've seen you can write, here's the list of things that you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| three of these, and those can get muddy quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| I would be concerned about how that actually was articulated and how that was figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6175)|
| 1:43:04| I think one more thing on this before we move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| and like Amy said, this may not be the perfect solution for it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| but it is our initial recommendation from the advancements process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| is that as these are coming up, I think just reiterating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| one of the things we heard so resoundingly throughout the community engagement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| was the lack of predictability in the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| I think amending our plan monthly plays into that lack of predictability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| because the plan is constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I think we need to think about that, do all the pieces together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| and try to figure out the right balance where we're not being punitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| to somebody who does have the most perfect development that's going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| and we don't want it to languish for however long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| and then they lose the property, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| and we miss out on this great community opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| We also don't want to change it so much that the 4,000 folks who weighed in on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| and spent their time and energy helping us create this vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| we don't care what they said by changing it so regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| because a developer or somebody wants to change it for some other benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| That may or may not have to be any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| Last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| We wanted to draw your guys' attention to a couple of additional implementation actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| This first one here we've already hit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| That's the modifying the process for plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| with the goal of eventually getting to annual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| but over the next two years, being it six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| as you guys kind of work through getting to know the plan and getting used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| We mentioned the action about that initial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| We think that's something that should be ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| You guys don't sit on the planning commission forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| So ask new folks, come on, cycle off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| making sure that that training is something that's maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| and kept so that you guys can be serving the community in a consistent way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| The implementation evaluation, that policy and action sheet on 71,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| that's kind of our report out on what we're doing every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| how much progress we've made on making advanced NOCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| and kind of the goals and visions a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| That's also our opportunity to review those things that aren't working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| or as we've thought about some of the trends that might have come up over the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| this is our place to kind of document that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| and make sure that we're addressing it in some of those updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| We have on here the update of the state of the county report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| recommending this on a three- to five-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| I think this is something that's driven more by how much the county is growing and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| So three to five years is typically pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| If you guys see a couple of years of just tremendous growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| and something kind of unusual or different than what we would expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| that might be something you revisit a little bit more regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| But a lot of those data sources anyways are only available every three to five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| so revisiting them is not going to tell you much different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| than what we looked at this year as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| And then requiring all staff reports to reference the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| So this is something that you probably already see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| in some of your kind of documentation that you get in your packets monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| but making sure going forward that all development applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| code amendments, rezoning, policy, anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| directly references kind of how it supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| and furthers the mission of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| That is our last formal slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| We are here for any more questions that you guys may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| We've appreciated kind of the back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| It makes me feel less like a lecturer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| which is why I did not get a PhD and go to school to be a tutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| But happy to entertain anything else you guys have while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| I had a few questions about the transportation aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| So my understanding has been that part of the goal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| is to maybe limit some of the sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| and also have more walkable and connected areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| And as I look at it more, it seems like there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| Well, and again, the map that we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| some of the colors are hard to distinguish between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| but the entire suburban growth section of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| none of those have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| They all only list automobile as the source of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| And then to contrast that, the photos that are in here all show sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| which are what makes these photos nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| is the fact that they're pedestrian-friendly and accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| And then also looking at the anticipated funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| the pedestrian category only has about 3% in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6462)|
| 1:47:50| Everything else is automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| And also, maybe it's in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| I haven't seen anything about alternative means of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| So bike lanes, public transit, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| I'm confused about this because it seems like it doesn't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| Yes, I understand that there's changes and improvements for those aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| but it still seems like alternative forms of transportation to automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| are a little bit on kind of a back burner in a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| I know that that's not the intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| but is there any specific reason why there's not more focus on alternative transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| and that these zones don't list other alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| Yeah, Logan, I'd like to talk a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| Some of the misleading in the maintenance projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| all the road infrastructure that we currently do always has that built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| so it's kind of inclusive in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| For instance, Camp Hall Road, we're going to go to construction with this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| obviously it's wide and taking out all the hills and curves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| so it's got that safety component, adding turn lanes where needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| But the other thing we're doing is putting sidewalk on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| and a 10-foot wide shared use path on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| Shaw Road, for instance, that's currently underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| has bypass on both sides of the street as well as sidewalks on both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| So a lot of that multimodal stuff is baked into the cake already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| So not to say we can't look at other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| but I did want you to know that that's a little bit misleading because it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| That's definitely helpful to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| Was there any consideration for future, because if we're thinking long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| I would hope that as we grow and have more extensities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| that there might be some public transit options in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| Has there been consideration of that in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| and how we could plan for public transit connectivity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| I can take the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| We did have some discussions around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Kat was involved in our committees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| Right now, it didn't seem from anything we heard from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| that there was a huge appetite or that we are developed in a fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| that would be supportive of that kind of transportation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| The places that we heard the most appetite was actually partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| with some of those business parts to provide workforce transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| So that was something that did come out of some of the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| But in terms of what you see with big straddle service with Kat today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| I think when we talk about that 10-year update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| if the county has made progress on recognizing and realizing the vision of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| then I think revisiting that transit conversation in terms of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| that would be the opportune time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| But as the county is developed and laid out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| and with kind of the way attitudes and mentalities were up to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| we were talking with, there's not a fair award at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Sorry, one more thing I did want to call out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| In policy 9, there is one thing that Jim's team is going to undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| as part of one of their actions, and that's to establish typical road standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| And to Jim's point, they're already considering complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| kind of to use that word, that incorporate the bicycle and pedestrian facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| in a lot of their design projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| But these typical standards would kind of set that expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| for what bicycle or pedestrian accommodations would go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| if we wrote projects for their collectors of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Yeah, and that's helpful to know that, A, that's kind of baked in to some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| and then also with the long-term 10 years revisiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| And then with the other land-use areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6692)|
| 1:51:40| it seems like maybe they're potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| and maybe I'm thinking about how this would be used incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| but potentially some danger in not listing secondary modes of transportation as in A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6706)|
| 1:51:56| on these, because if I'm looking at this as a guide for my developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| in one of these areas, if I'm in the traditional neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| or even in the business park with a small bike as a secondary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| I'm going to go into it with an understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| and actually also the rural crossroads does too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| but I'm going to go into that with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| that I need to have considerations for pedestrian, walk, bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| But if I am looking at corridor commercial or suburban residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| I think there's another one in that category that doesn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| Yeah, suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| Even though a lot of these pictures are showing sidewalks as kind of a guide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| it's not really discussed as creating pedestrian walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| so I don't think people would expect to need to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6772)|
| 1:52:59| So if you're doing a subdivision in one of these and it's not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| that the consideration of pedestrians is part of this requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| or I guess part of this area, I see that being potentially dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| by not listing those long-term because we see so many cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| where we're looking at subdivision plans and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| oh, this needs more connection, more pedestrian walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| and if we're not mentioning it in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| it seems like it's going to be hard to push for that as we develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| Is there a reason those were left out, or am I maybe seeing that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| Are there not implications like that by leaving it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| I think the thing to remember with these, and I think that is a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| is are we sending the wrong message maybe by leaving those absent from something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| But I do think the thing that's missing in kind of how we would do this ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| is we have to think about the Unified Development Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| and each of these place types will have a corresponding zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| and that's where it will spell out very clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| you have to develop sidewalks on your projects to X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| So even if this doesn't imply that the secondary mode is walk-by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| we're still going to have policies that require developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| to improve their frontage with sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| or kind of provide that pedestrian access into their developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| So I think that's kind of the second piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| but I do think the point you raised about whether we're sending the wrong message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| if it's implying that when we talk about corridor curbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| we don't care about the ability to bicycle walk into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| is a valid concern about how those things are portrayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| But these are backed up by the Unified Development Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| that does have that kind of fitness to require those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| Would it be possible to reword and back to what Sharon brought up earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| with the transportation on mixed-use and traditional neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| and then town center mixed-use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| It seems like corridor mixed-use should be flipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| where we're focusing more on walk-by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| because same as traditional neighborhood and town center mixed-use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| you still have to drive to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| but it's listing walk-by as the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| I just wondered if this would seem more cohesive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| if we were saying in the mixed-use, TZN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| and then town center mixed-use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| all of those have walk-by as the primary and automobile as the secondary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| and then in the suburban residential corridor commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| and I think that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| have it flipped so that it's saying automobile is the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| and then walk-by is the secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| It may be too late in the game to add in wording like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| but that seems to be more cohesive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| if we're trying to say there is a primary and a secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| so to have those listed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| I think that's definitely something that we can take a closer look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| and you all are in this process now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| so you all should look at the comprehensive planning commission's document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| It is something that you all were tasked with creating and developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| so you all can look at it in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| So just listening over the last, I guess, five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| of what the communities talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| and they do talk about transportation being backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| They talk about stormwater flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| and the third one, which it would be great to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| how it could be a part of the summary of action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| and who we would converse with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| and that could be integrated in the conversation are schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| It would seem to me that when we talk about developing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| where people can walk and be a part of their communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| and have that sense of how proud it is as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| everything that you told us about in these 4,000 folks that gave input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| it would seem schools are at the heart of so many of these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| I don't know how, and when you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| the Hardin Valley, look at what's already happened out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| and how much that's exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| It seems like schools, especially being that this is Knox County's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| it would seem like there would be a stronger component of future schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| where those are going to be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| because that's going to be huge to drive economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| and contact space, the need for walkability and multi-use type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| all of these different 12, 13 zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| good ones that would be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| It just seems like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| We seem so much to say that's not part of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| but in a comprehensive plan like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| it would seem, would it be possible to have more of an emphasis on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7081)|
| 1:58:10| I will say that, Tamara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| we've met with the school administration several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| We're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| One of the things that we have on our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| is the capital projects of that need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| they're now included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| So I think the communication there has been much improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| because you're right, in the past, it hasn't been as good as it should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| With the new COO over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| he's been very receptive to that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| providing us capacity numbers for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| So I think that we're heading in a good direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| That's just such a family driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| When you bring in new businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| often the folks want to know where would my child go to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| how far away is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| And right now, it seems like we're moving students around a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| and we sort of break up that sense of community when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| So it's not on the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Sharing facilities, using parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| I think the schools are mentioned twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| once or twice in the action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| but it's more as ancillary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| So if something can actually be put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| where it requires us to talk more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| I'm glad you brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| So one thought is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| we talked about doing annual evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| and so putting that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| adding some language that says specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| that we want to do it with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| let me raise this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| and we won't throw at you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| when you're talking about what their future plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| because it obviously will influence growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| I think a lot of folks called to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| the impact on schools number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| And I know there's a formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| and we plug it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| and that's what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| but they'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| what do you mean there's going to be 12 students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| It's a giant subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| And so anything that shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| and maybe we can help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| the need for extra resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| to support development and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| and walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| and our thriving community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7213)|
| 2:00:21| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240130?start=7225)|
