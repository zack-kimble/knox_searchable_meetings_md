| 0:00:22| Heavenly Father, thank you again for another beautiful day in East Tennessee. We wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=22)|
| 0:00:33| about lack of rain in our area and then we learn about storms on the East Coast destroying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=33)|
| 0:00:41| communities and their property and our hearts reach out to them and they're in our hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=41)|
| 0:00:46| and our prayers. We ask you to be with us this evening at this Council meeting to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=46)|
| 0:00:52| us to listen to the constituents and try to make the decisions that are best for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| community. We know we can't make everyone happy, but we are here and we ask for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| guidance to do the very best we can as stewards for the resources. And finally, we ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=63)|
| 0:01:12| you help us help all those who are needy and within our power to help. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=80)|
| 0:01:37| Please call the roll, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Councilman Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| McCampin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Councilman Della Vopi. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Vice Mayor Grieve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Councilwoman Palmer. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Councilman Pavlis. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Councilman Saunders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Councilman Starr. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| We have two absent, but we have a quorum so we can continue. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| Any opposed? Minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement. Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| Thank you. 11M, we would like to postpone for two weeks until October 25th. This has to do with the pilot and I would like, if it's okay, to have Bill just address one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=135)|
| 0:02:31| Certainly. Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Certainly. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| In talking with some of you, it's clear that we probably didn't do as good a job as we should have in explaining the third party review process that we committed to for all tax increment financing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=155)|
| 0:02:46| And we are, in fact, doing those. We've done one and the process was illuminating, but we need to perfect it more, or perfect it, I guess would be the correct language, before we extend it to pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=166)|
| 0:02:59| We're not committing to doing them for all of the pilot projects because many of them involve a lot of variables and considerations that we can best handle here that are local matters and incentives to achieve other public purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=179)|
| 0:03:12| But we will want to use them for some, especially the larger ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| So this project that we are postponing does not, in fact, have a third party review, but it has an extensive review in-house and we're providing you more information, background information, so you'll have more time to look at it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=198)|
| 0:03:32| So we appreciate your pointing out to us that you needed more information and apologize if there was some confusion on the entire third party review commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| All right, so are you going to add another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Item 12A, the parking ordinance, we'd like to postpone that until December 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| I'll be making an announcement at the appropriate time about workshops, but that would be 12A until December 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| Okay, so we're postponing 11M for two weeks and we're postponing 12A until December 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=241)|
| 0:04:11| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Okay, any discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Oh, did we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| I just had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| I guess one thing that I would say, just as a comment, what is big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| And I would offer that a 15-year pilot is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| So maybe it's a number of years and maybe it's a 10-year is not big or five years is not big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| But I think some of the pilots have been pretty small and I would think it would be defined by the number of years, but that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| And did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to postpone those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| The ayes have it and those are postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Anything else for postponement or anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| We're now on consent items, 12D as a 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| The ayes have it and that item is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| For the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| So we've got a lot of things coming up over the next few weeks I'm going to tell you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| But first I want to say thank you again to everyone who came out to the various events we had to celebrate our 225th birthday of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=328)|
| 0:05:38| I want to thank Kim Bumpass and everyone at Visit Knoxville for helping to lead our celebration this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| and to Lisa Zinney and the Arts and Culture Alliance for all that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Of course, to the FOLTS and our special events office and staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| The events included the first official poem written by our City Poet Laureate, R.B. Morris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| since he took that post earlier this year and he gave a reading of it at the dinner on the Gay Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| and also at the Founder's Day Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| If you missed it, we have it posted on our website at knoxvilletn.gov slash poet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| and it is a heartfelt birthday card to our city, so I definitely encourage everyone to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Okay, so several public meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| First is this Thursday, October 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| There are two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| At 5.30 p.m. there's a public meeting on a couple of important streetscape and utility upgrade projects that are about to get underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| Those are on Central Street and Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| That meeting with KUB, City Engineering, and the City Office of Redevelopment staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| will be at Central United Methodist Church, which is at 201 East 3rd Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| just off Central in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| The Central Street project is about a $5 million KUB and city investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| while the Jackson Avenue upgrade represents about a $2 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| So come on out to find out about the plans and the time frames for both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| Again, that meeting, pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| The time of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Yeah, Thursday, October 13th at 5.30 p.m. at Central United Methodist Church, 3rd Avenue, right in 4th and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=433)|
| 0:07:23| Okay, next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Also that night is the quarterly meeting of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| That is at 6 p.m. on Thursday, October 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| That meeting will be at Vestal United Methodist Church, which is 115 Ogle Avenue in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| As always, the PARC quarterly meeting is an opportunity for residents to hear from PARC about its recent activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| and also to present any questions, comments, or concerns they have about our police departments, policies, and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| Okay, so then next Monday, October 17th, also in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| there will be a meeting at 5.30 p.m. about Fort Dickerson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| The meeting will be at the recently renovated Kearns Bakery Building at 2110 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| We're seeking public input on recreation options for the Quarry Lake at Fort Dickerson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and there will also be an update on the Gateway Project at the PARC's Chapman Highway entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| That meeting is sponsored by the City, by Aslan Foundation, Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| and Sanders Pace Architecture with Port Urbanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| So it'll be a great opportunity to hear about the plans at Fort Dickerson and help shape the future of that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| It's also a nice opportunity to see the Kearns Building, see what they've done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Again, that is Monday, October 17th at 5.30 at the renovated Kearns Bakery Building on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| Okay, the next night, Tuesday, October 18th, there will be, guess what, another public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| This one is seeking input as our policy and law departments work to draw up an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| regulating short-term rentals in Knoxville, Airbnb and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| The meeting will be at 5.30 p.m. Tuesday, October 18th at Central United Methodist Church, 201 East 3rd Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=553)|
| 0:09:23| As you probably know, we are seeing a growing number of listings in Knoxville on the online platforms like Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| where people rent out rooms or sometimes a whole house to visitors for a few nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| We know they're operating in Knoxville. We estimate about 200 or so that are already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| And like many cities across the state and country, we are looking at how to properly address that reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| in a way that will both protect our neighborhoods and visitors alike when they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| So you can read more about some of the issues involved on our website under the Plans Review and Inspections page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| on our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Again, that meeting on the short-term rentals is Tuesday, October 18th at 5.30, Central United Methodist Church, 201 East 3rd Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=605)|
| 0:10:15| Next Thursday, October 20th at 7 p.m., there will be, yes, another public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| to present an update to the South Waterfront Form-Based Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| That meeting will be at South Knox Elementary School, 801 Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| These are mostly some small housekeeping type adjustments to the Form-Based Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| which has been periodically updated over the past nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| As new development has picked up along the South Waterfront in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| we have seen some places where we've needed to adapt the code to reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| But all of the protections to ensure environmentally sensitive and pedestrian-friendly development are still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=650)|
| 0:11:01| so don't worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| And you can get all the details at the meeting, again, South Waterfront Form-Based Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Thursday, October 20th at 7 p.m. at South Knox Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| And all of these are on the website somewhere, right, on our main page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Communications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Yes, and we will also be putting out a comprehensive listing of all of them tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| with all the relevant links and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| And that will be on our blog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Yes, on the blog and on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Okay, so if you didn't bring your pencil with you or you've lost track, you can still find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| Okay, on Monday, October 24th, we have not a public meeting but a public walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| This will be the second in our Neighborhoods to Nature series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| with a destination of Beardsley Farm in the Malcolm Martin Park just east of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Neighborhood residents will be leaving from three starting points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| the Danny Mayfield Park in Mechanicsville, from Beaumont Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| and from Westview Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| And we'll all be leaving at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| I'll be joining one of the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| I'm leaving from Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| And council, as we did last time, different council members who are participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| will leave from different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| And neighborhood folks from those neighborhoods will be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| and anybody else who wants to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| There will also be a lot of city staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Each group will take about a 15 to 20-minute walk to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| We'll all converge on the Malcolm Martin Park at Beardsley Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| And you can tour Beardsley Farm, enjoy music by DJ Sterl the Pearl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| He's going to be joining us, which is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| You can play some basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| You can eat food from several local food truck options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| and visit booths offering information on neighborhood services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| This will be a really great family-friendly event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| and I'm looking forward to see all the participants from those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| and anybody else who wants to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Our first Neighborhood to Nature walk was really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| We ended up at Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| And from, I think, four different neighborhoods, four or so different locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| they came and joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| It was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Okay, so if all that isn't enough civic activity for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| there is always voting, and most importantly voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| If you don't go to any public meetings, you still have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Early voting for the November 8th elections begins next Wednesday, October 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| And you can find the times and locations online at the Knox County Election Commission website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| knoxcounty.org slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| And that continues until a few days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| I'm sorry I don't have the ending date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| A couple days off, and then, of course, November 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| I want to remind you that there are four City of Knoxville charter amendments on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| one to change the date of the city primary, moving it up a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Normally it's in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| and the Election Commission has asked that we move it up to August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| so that they have more time to process the ballots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| and particularly for the veterans, I mean the military, active military and all who are overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| One is to change the date of the city primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| and then three of them are to make some small adjustments to our pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| which the Pension Board has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| All of these have been placed on the ballot by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| The pension amendments in particular are kind of technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and I know people often have a hard time trying to figure out what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| We all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| So that's why we posted a handy guide explaining them in plain English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| We hope it's plain English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| That's the attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Eric Relan, where's Eric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| He's our Deputy Director of Communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Really did do a good job, a great job, translating them from legalese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| So you can look at our website at knoxvilletn.gov slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| The other vote is one you can cast more than once, and that is, in fact, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| One of our Knoxville schools, really wonderful schools, is Beaumont Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| or Beaumont Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| and they are a national finalist for a $100,000 Dream Big grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| $100,000 Dream Big grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| They can do a lot with $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| They want to add arts performance areas and arts-themed play equipment to the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| So they are the only school in Tennessee to make this finalist list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| so we encourage everyone to lend a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| You can vote online every day at VoteBMA for Beaumont Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| VoteBMA.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| That's how we won that outstanding Bell grant for the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| and the Baker Creek Preserve for the track there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| So we can win this if everybody votes every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| All right, so that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| We'd just like to add a few more dates to everyone's list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| City Council will be having two workshops coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| The first one will be on November 3rd at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| We're going to be dealing with the parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| and want to make sure that everyone understands that one will be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| at Lakeshore Park Administration Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| That will be at the Administration Building at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| November 3rd at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| That's going to be on the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| The next one is going to be November 17th workshop at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| It will be held here in the main assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| and that will be to discuss the Bearden mixed-use overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| We'll have a workshop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| That will be November 17th, Thursday, located here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Also, I'd like to announce that on Monday, October 17th at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| in Talahi Park in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| there will be a presentation of a $30,000 presentation state grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| to and for the restoration of the fountains there in Talahi Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| So everyone's invited, and I invite my colleagues to be there on Monday at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Councilman Dallarampi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Just briefly, I just wanted to thank everyone who helped to make the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| and North Economic Summit a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| We really appreciate the city workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| especially the folks from the council office who have gone above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and beyond the call of duty to help get us information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| The police got us crime statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| MPC pulled together a lot of demographic data, and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| But we appreciate the staff pitching in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Our hope is that we've started a conversation between neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| and the business and professional groups, and that that will have some ongoing impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| I know one of the groups, Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| is going to start meeting with neighborhood groups on October 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| to set up their own vision plan for their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| But the idea is to start a grassroots kind of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| and see where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| So thank everyone for their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Oh, and the city website has a lot of that demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| and other data, the crime statistics and everything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| It's, of course, Knoxville10.gov and then slash council events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| and you can go there and look at that data at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| And if you're a business, you can find out a lot about the demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and opportunities that you might not have thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| On October 20th, we've got another public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| We're meeting at 5 p.m. in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1136)|

| 0:19:02| on the South Knoxville form-based code, but it's not until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| So you could get a two-for-one that day, get two public meetings in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| And if you know anybody that would like to name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| or rename a piece of public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| make sure to get their applications in very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1157)|

| 0:21:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| We have someone signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Our former City Councilman, Charlie Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| You know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Charlie Thomas, 386 Hiawassee Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Mayor, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And I also sit on the Knox Greenway Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| and I am for the Fifth District, and that's the area that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| proposed greenway is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Pull the mic to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Just a few words on this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| When we think of greenways, this particular stretch of greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| has just about everything, all the amenities that we can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| It starts at a park, ends at a shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| with a public school in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| And it also runs along a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| So all the amenities we think of as far as recreation, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| alternative transportation, environmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| all that's contained in this particular greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I can't think of a more deserving space along the entire system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| It also will be a big step forward in connecting to another greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| which is the First Creek Greenway, which is on the other side of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| which is a beautiful greenway, but it's underused at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| simply because it's not connected up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| So the addition of this greenway will be a big step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| Also, the greater vision of someday having a main artery from Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| all the way down to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| It's not easy to build greenways in an urban setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| There's lots of hoops you have to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I want to thank the people in engineering and Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| for getting us this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| So with that said, I don't want to take up any more of your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| but I would wish that you would pass this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| I want to thank Charlie for his years of work on greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| and we appreciate the time you dedicate and sacrifice to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| It shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| You're also on our planning commission, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1408)|

| 0:24:18| as part of the Cedar Lane sidewalk project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1458)|

| 0:24:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| That would be $1,227,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1462)|

| 0:25:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Yes, this is a great project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| and I guess Dawn Michelle or Jim Hagerman are sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| wanting to tell us a little bit about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| but that business access road that's going to happen along there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| is something we're all looking forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| We know it takes a lot of time to gather the parcels, do the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| work with TDOT and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Just give us a nickel's worth, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| This is just an update or a basic project description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| The I-275 business access road will extend from 17th and Dell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| and extend Blackstock Avenue over to Bernard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| and from there you'll have some roadway realignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| to connect across Bernard to Marion Street all the way to Baxter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| so that they will run parallel to the I-275 project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| You'll have sidewalk and a greenway component to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| We're going to revitalize, basically, a brownfield, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Basically, it runs right along the former PSC metal site there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| and so there's an opportunity to kind of redevelop the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| for opportunity for job creation and more economic vitality in the area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Let's hope to condense some of that property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| for light manufacturing and warehouse in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| It's a great component to what's going on with Cisco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| and the hosting gas site nearby, so it's a great component to the area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| We appreciate the city's work on that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1594)|

| 0:27:53| We're going to get rid of some, I guess, dirty belching diesels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| and move towards hybrids and cleaner vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| but just tell us what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| This is CMAQ money that will allow us to replace four of our older diesel buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| with hybrid vehicles, which will be better, of course, for our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| and also one of our lift vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| And the city's got a match in that, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| We have some portion of the money we're going to put into the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1703)|

| 0:29:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Yes, our firm represents Waste Connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I need to abstain on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| And we do have Mr. King is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| but I understand you're only here to answer any questions if anybody has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| I have one, but I guess it's for Chad Weth or David Brace, whoever is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| and he's answered it to me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| but I think it's worth, again, reviewing what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| and how it's going to help us save money in our waste handling activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Chad Weth, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| The one thing that we are trying to accomplish here, too, is with a standardized cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| So one of the savings that we talked about at the last council meeting was having that standardized cart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| and the contract here with Waste Connections is kind of tying that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| The standardized garbage cart, 95-gallon cart, allows, again, a more modern look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| and that's where the cost savings come from a new hauling contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| And this will enable them to mechanically lift the heavy carts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| I mean, it won't be fully automated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| It will still be semi-automated because of a lot of our alleys and service corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I mean, they will still require, for example, two workers to get the cart to the truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| but then it will be tipped by a tipper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Chad, a couple of concerns that have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and I'm sure all of us have heard about the size of the cart and perceived difficulty in moving it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| It's varmint-proofness, which some people do have a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| and access that handicapped folks may have and arrangements that may be made for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| So you might address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| One thing to keep in mind with the city's waste policy is we do have a backdoor garbage service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| I'd like to say that first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| So if there is any issues with customers taking their garbage down to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| they can apply for backdoor garbage service, which is anybody that's 75 years or older or has a medical need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| They don't have to move their garbage to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Our contractor will come up their driveway and collect their garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| Besides that, I do think most people would find, you know, this is kind of a standardized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| It's the standard industry size is 95 gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| And while it sounds like a lot, the footprint of a 95-gallon cart is really not any bigger than two 32-gallon cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| So it sounds big, but a lot of that is the tall or the height of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| And, again, they don't recommend any too smaller because then they can be blown over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and they're not varmint-proof, as you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| So, again, the 95-gallon is a standardized size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| We have one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So we have this passes 6-0 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| One abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| One abstention, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| 11K as a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Kelly Fletcher PR LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| for the marketing, public outreach, and education services associated with improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| and modernization to solid waste management that will take place over the next 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| for a total amount not to exceed $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Councilman Dallarampi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Yeah, I guess Chad is still sitting there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| But, you know, at first blush this looks like a lot of money to teach how to fill your garbage can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| and get it to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| And I react a little bit to that, but I understand it's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| And this city has gone a long way towards recycling more and more of the waste stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| I think this is the same outfit that helped us start that program, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| It's a different firm, but Cheryl Ball, who's also with us in the audience, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| She is part of Fletcher Consulting, and she was the person that helped us develop our recycling rollout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| with the do your part with the cart slogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Could you just say briefly what this contract is going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| As you mentioned, part of it is with garbage carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Unfortunately, there is a few issues that come with that as far as where do you place the cart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| how do you get the cart down your street, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| So it is about educating folks on how to use the garbage cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| It's also about pushing more recycling for the city and also any changes that come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| Our processor has talked about removing glass from the recycling stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| which is something that we are going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| So this money is not just for garbage carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| It's also to educate and communicate with our residents about those changes as far as removing glass, the carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| And what else is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| We may find there's still a market for glass if it is sorted and it's at a drop-off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| So we may find if we need to open up more drop-off centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| that's going to be some of the other things that this marketing folks will help us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And when you talk about sorted, you're saying the color of the different bottle streams need to be separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| so that the whole batch can be recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| The market for glass in a single stream has really become nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| It's very difficult on our processor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| I think some of you all have toured that facility before as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| If it is sorted out with brown, green, so on and so forth, then there is still a market for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| So this communications is not only about to make sure we communicate those changes correctly to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| It's also about the carts, the recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| and then also with these change in carts, try to encourage more people to recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Are you going to work with purchasing or anyone to maybe have a request for proposals on dealing with glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| or get the industry thinking about ways they might put it back into a useful stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| Because it is a lot of weight and a lot of bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Basically from now until January 1, it's going to be mainly about carts and glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| That's really what Cheryl will be focused on with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| After that, for the next six months, we really plan on doing a lot of public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I think Cheryl kept track and said last time we did 43 public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| which is a lot with our small solid waste staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So we plan on doing that again and really getting the public input on what our solid waste program really needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| Again, carts, more recycling carts, more drop-off centers, those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| For the next six months, we will be getting public input on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| and then if anything changes based on that public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| that's when it would become even another marketing portion to roll out more recycling carts or whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you for pursuing that and helping us keep our environment clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Will the marketing firm be reaching out to the various neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| or do they have to request that meeting, or how will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| No, we plan on actually there's already been some communication about how to push recycling in certain neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2204)|
| 0:36:52| that have a low volume of recyclers right now, so we already have a plan on how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| I think we've – is Erin still back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| I know she's talked with us, too, about SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| They are wanting to help with the push for the marketing of the recyclers, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| so they have volunteered to assist us with this, especially East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| So we'll be reaching out, not just waiting for people to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2243)|

| 0:37:27| 11L is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a license agreement with Clinch River Brewing, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| for the use of a portion of the Crutch Park extension as a patio area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Mayor, I'll have to recuse myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Don Michelle, just tell us briefly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| I know you have Rick Emmett here, and maybe he's the one you want to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| but just tell us what we're doing here and how we're preserving, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| the right to use that park space for something different should this lease arrangement not work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| The license arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| We've been working with this particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Brian Shirey and his wife Lisa are here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| We're hoping to open a restaurant in the bottom of the Holston building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| That's been vacant for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| We've been trying to get someone in there for a long time to try to get some more retail in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Unfortunately, the way that building is configured, there's really not any way to get easily into that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| So a doorway or some sort of entrance off Crutch Park extension is really the only way to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| These folks are proposing to do a restaurant, like I said, and they want to have a patio in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| I think it's 12 feet by 80 feet is what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| It's kind of over in the landscaped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| It's really not used for special events or any other purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| It's beyond the sidewalk area there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| We used some trustee money that we received when we bought Crutch Park years ago to buy the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| so we've had to get okay with the trustee to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| It has to be for the quiet enjoyment of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| We feel like this patio will do that, accomplish several goals, and activate an area of Crutch Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| particularly in the evening, that is not well utilized right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| We think it will be a good enhancement for the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| And this is more of a use agreement than any disposition of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| so the city will still have parkland if they need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| This is not a deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| We're not deeding the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| It's more of an easement or a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| A license, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| With one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| With one, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2391)|

| 0:40:09| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2411)|

| 0:40:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Mayor, I wonder if Christy or someone could just tell us what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I mean, growing tomatoes on the public property or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| We'll ask Aaron Gill to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Or Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Brian will come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Hi, Brian Blackman, Project Manager, Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| Really what we're talking about here is step one in the next phase of the Urban Agriculture Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| And what this is going to be is us going out and seeking an open procurement to license city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| We've heard from quite a few community groups and nonprofits that are interested in starting community gardens that don't have the land available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| And there are city parcels near them that they're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Are these city parcels that are not dedicated to a specific use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| You've just got land in sort of the land bank, if you will, that you're going to let people use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| One in particular is essentially a turnabout behind the South Knoxville Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| That's one area of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2477)|

| 0:42:50| and I am here representing multiple parents who has been trying to research what has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| Some of them have contacted your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| So I would just like to give a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| My daughter signed a lease at the Standard Apartment building last year, October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| end of October, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| And in the lease, it showed that if they did not give a completed apartment building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| they had 60 days to provide temporary accommodations as per the lease, including hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2599)|
| 0:43:28| They were very specific about that in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And they did not deliver a bedroom to my daughter on move-in day, October 13, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2611)|
| 0:43:40| And it's October 10th today, and she was delivered a bedroom on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| She is on Level 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| So Levels 1 through 4, with the exception of three bedrooms, have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Levels 4 through 8 have not been approved by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| And it has been very frustrating to figure out where they are in the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2638)|
| 0:44:08| using public records and the things that are available to us as citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| We did as much research as we could, talking to building inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Peter Ahrens at the city codes has been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| However, as a citizen and a parent, even with doing due diligence and gathering information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| and putting together spreadsheets, because we are not provided this information by the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| we still have difficulty understanding what the code is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| And our expectations are different than what the codes provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| And it's been a very frustrating experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| particularly because the standard has been sending out e-mails to all of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| and guarantors for several months now, promising us and showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| And with goodwill, we thought that they would be delivering their units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| in not too far time off from the promised date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| For example, they gave us September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Then they said September 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| My daughter was supposed to be able to move in on September 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| And on September 14th, they informed us that no, her room would not be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| And I have done the research, and Peter Ahrens at the city inspections office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| says that they do not give future inspection approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| So Landmark has been misleading students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| They've been misleading guarantors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| They've been misleading the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| They've been using the city's words that are not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| to mislead students in making decisions about their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| Should I get a second lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Should I live somewhere that's better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| And also, the thing that I wanted to bring up, I know time is short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| is there aren't checks and balances in place for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| And I know that the city can only provide certain codes and certain standard of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| However, the dean of students can't help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| It's off-campus housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Your offices have helped us as much as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| but we still feel like we're misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and we feel like we're not getting the product that we signed leases for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| I believe that the students actually, in hindsight, signed junk leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| There's another property in Boone right now that is not – they do not have a home either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| They did not meet October 13th as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| So what I am proposing is I would – I'm seeking help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| I'm seeking help from the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| I'm seeking help from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| I'm seeking help from anyone who could help us with legal assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| We are all in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| We're in different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And I'm seeking for there possibly to be a way to avoid this situation in the future for students in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| because when you provide – when you allow construction in an urban environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| but there are not enough hotels within that urban environment to provide continuous temporary housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| for that number of students in that apartment building, it is a real housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| And I am really concerned about that because, as you know and you've seen in the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| students have had to move in and out and in and out because of the football games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| And at this very point in time, if they do not approve Levels 5 and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| there will be another housing shortage emergency this week due to the Knoxville Convention that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| So I'm seeking your help in any way possible, somebody to represent the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| That's what I – and I would like to know if we could have this on another – on the agenda for next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Well, what I would recommend is that you – there are several staff members here tonight who can speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| I think Christy Branscom has already talked to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| It's not something that would go on the agenda because –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| and I'm going to ask Christy Branscom and David Brace to address council and give them an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| This isn't a back-and-forth forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| That's not how we do this, but what I – because it's been in the press so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| and we have all been working on this because we are well aware of what you all are going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| We have heard from you and from many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| I'd like Christy to update council on it, but it's not appropriate for an agenda item for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| But there are many staff members who are here who have a hand in this one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I mean, who understand what's going on or trying to do what we can do as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| And they'd be glad to talk to you afterwards or in the days ahead with any other parents who might want to meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| So if you would just have a seat, then I'll ask Christy to let us update council on what our situation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2925)|
| 0:48:54| in terms of what the city can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And then when the meeting is over in a few minutes, others will be able to talk to you if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I would love to see the city of Knoxville set a standard for protecting students across the nation that are in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Christy, you want to update council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Yeah, pardon the pun, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Christy Branscom, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| And last Friday we did get rooms, or floors rather, one through three approved by our Building Permits and Inspections Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| You guys know Director Peter Ahrens, and Peter has been in contact with Ms. Gardner and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| That was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Then Peter gave a long, excuse me, that was not approved on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| What happened is we met with them, and Peter put together a long list of things that needed to happen for them to get the first three floors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| We had an inspector come in on Saturday, paid them to come in on a Saturday to meet with them to do the first three floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2984)|
| 0:49:54| and the standard had addressed all those issues on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| Obviously we're charged with making sure that codes and inspections and building codes and fire codes are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| They were met for the first three floors, but obviously that does not necessarily mean it's a completely finished product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| and I'm sure that's where the frustration is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| And as Ms. Gardner said, there's different expectations for what we require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| and then of course what she would require for her daughter, and frankly what I would have for mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| So that's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| And then I know, David, you did talk with Peter this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Is there any new update? No, that's what we have at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| So we will, I talked with Ms. Gardner, David did, we will continue to talk with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| and we have all along to try to get them to move along and get this project up and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| But we don't obviously have a contract with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| We don't have a contract with the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| We are charged with upholding the codes, building and fire codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| So it puts us all in a, it puts us, the city, in a predicament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| But we had done background checks on this particular company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| and they are one of the largest, if not the largest, builder of student housing in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| So we're not sure exactly what all went wrong on this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| but we're certainly going to be evaluating that and reviewing the project with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Okay, next for public forum is Mr. Presley, Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| My name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| Lady, I'd be glad to help you protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| I'll sit down there two hours in front of the building and get you some publicity out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| Let these people know that you need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| Knoxville is the most racist city I ever lived or visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| A teenage incident that happened to me July 21st at Fort Sanders Medical Center proved how racist this city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| The sheriff's office can hide this lady for her Black Lives Matter incident toward me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| but I will continue to speak out about how racist you people are and are willing to hide this lady officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| The FBI finally called me back after I complained to the ACLU in Nashville to prove how racist this city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3126)|
| 0:52:17| You people supported the newspaper to the world hero Muhammad Ali on the front page of your Sunday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3137)|
| 0:52:28| That's sad, and I'm going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| As long as Muhammad Ali did for us, I will continue to bring this paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| It's been June, and I'm going to continue to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| And you can put me down on the next agenda for public forum again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| At least your governor is not supporting your homeboy, Donald Racist Trump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| If America is not the racist and if Knoxville is not racist, why did you people invite him, Trump, to Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3168)|
| 0:52:59| All politicians are liars and crooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| You have to be a liar in local, state, and federal government to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| You have lied to us, and you will lie to us to get to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Peyton Manning gave $10 million to Donald Trump, and his family told Trump the Manning family would give him more money if he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| I am going to KGB board meeting this Thursday, and that's why they are continually scamming customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| I ask all of you to please check your utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Last month, my bill dropped $60 from $410 to $359.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| Last month was extra hot, but my bill dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| I called KGB and asked them how did this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Yes, I appreciate the little drop in the money I saved last month, but you can bet KGB is going to make up for it in this winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3228)|
| 0:53:56| The first thing they are going to say is, oh, it's cold this winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| I had $20,000 worth of work done through the TVA CAC program, and my bill still was over $410, and KGB had no answers for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3239)|
| 0:54:11| This TVA KUBR program did excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| They stopped up my chimney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| They did every kind of fixing in the house we needed, but yet still my bill was extra high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| Three months ago, I talked to a lady at Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| I talked to another guy in Fountain City, and they said their bill was $40 over what it was the month before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| That was in July, so they got their way of getting us, and you people continue to tell me you have no authority over what KUB does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| but KUB has to come to you to get approval when they want to raise our utilities and anything else they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| and all you people do is continue to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Eventually, somebody has to stand up to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| You all can just sit up there and enjoy the life and not try to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| That lady was so right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| These companies are going to continue to take advantage of what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Brenda Palmer is the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| She drove by my house and watched me putting golf balls in my front yard, and I made sure I waved at her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| I did, and I enjoyed that moment, and every time I notice now the past three times I come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| every time it's time for a public forum, she walks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Now, if you all want to be professional and you want us to be professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| how can she walk out on the people that she's supposed to be supporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| And Amy Broad, she should run for county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| I'm going to support her, and good idea, walk the streets and try to get her support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| Oh, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| You said I had a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| How do you people say lethal injection is before the state courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| But you say abortion is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| Okay, she can have an abortion, but then you can kill that same person when they're an adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| You're supposed to be the Bible belt, but yet still you can do lethal injection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| That's just you make the rules and make the laws as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Okay, we have one more person who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| It's Lindsey Grillo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| Lindsey Grillo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer for you of up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Lindsey Grillo, and as of yesterday, 1819 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| This is about the standard, and, like, I know Ms. Gardner just went and talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| but, like, as a student, I feel like I have a little bit more trauma from it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| So, like, I am from Knoxville, so, like, when they told us originally it was going to be three weeks past the move-in date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| I lived at home for three weeks, and so I had to commute every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and had to deal with parking and gas and just taking an hour out of my day just to make sure I could get places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| And when they pushed our move-in date back another month into October, I asked for a hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and they gave me one in Cedar Bluff and said that was the best they could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| And when I called relentlessly and emailed, they finally gave me one ten minutes away from campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| because that was, you know, what they could pull at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| And so I went in to the leasing office one day and got really mad at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| and they finally gave me one next to campus, which apparently had rooms the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| And so it's just, like, it's been crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| And I moved in yesterday, and there was no help to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| My key didn't even work to my door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| There's dust in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| There are scuffs, like, on my walls and everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| There was no help getting my stuff from the parking garage upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| I scratched my car on a thing in the parking lot because the parking spots are too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| The fire alarm goes off probably every other hour because they want to test it and make sure it's safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| but it's, like, they don't even tell us if, like, well, there's going to be a real fire one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| We're not going to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Like, we're literally going to think it's another drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| And, like, I've got friends who are on the seventh and eighth floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| who don't even think they're going to be able to move in in a couple weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| and I've got friends on the fifth floor who are supposed to move in tomorrow who haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| And it's, like, so many people have broken a lease because we've been screwed for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3502)|
| 0:58:30| And so many kids, like, literally are depressed and have bad grades because we've had to live in hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| and we've had to deal with all this crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| And it's just, like, I was in the newspaper a few weeks for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| and you'd think if someone was in the newspaper talking about how bad it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| the standard would reach out to you, but, like, they've never said anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| They've never said anything to anybody else who's been in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| And so, like, now that I'm in, it's, like, a little bit less of a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| but, like, there's obviously still so many problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| So it's, like, anything that anybody can do to help the 672 kids who are supposed to live in the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| like, that would be awesome because we're all screwed out of our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| and we're still paying rent for something that's not even completely done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| and we have nowhere to park, and there's one elevator that works half of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| and there's one entrance to the whole building, and it's just, like, it's a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| And, you know, if I could go back a year ago to when I signed, I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| And it's just, like, anybody who can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| And I know there's kids, like, in other cities who are having the same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| but the fact that this is happening, like, nationally is, like, that's obviously an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| and, like, obviously someone needs to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| I just want you to know, as we stated earlier, as a city, there are only certain things that we have control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and we are doing everything that we can given the regulations and laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| We're very sorry that you and all the other students and parents are experiencing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| and just know that the city is responding in every way that we legally can to try and move this forward for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Well, that is all, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161011?start=3601)|
