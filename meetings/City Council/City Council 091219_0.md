| 0:00:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=0)|
| 0:00:01| Well, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1)|
| 0:00:02| I'd like to welcome everyone to the special called meeting of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=2)|
| 0:00:06| I would like to ask Mr. Woodhull if he would lead us in vocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| After that, I'm going to ask Ms. Roddy if she would lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=10)|
| 0:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=13)|
| 0:00:14| If we could stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=14)|
| 0:00:17| I had a suspicion that I was going to be asked to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=17)|
| 0:00:20| And just to honor this very important day, I pulled off of my bookshelf a book from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=20)|
| 0:00:29| of our famous Knoxville native sons, Dr. James Melvin Washington, who lived in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=29)|
| 0:00:39| called Austin Homes and went on to Harvard, was an ordained minister here for 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| went on to Harvard and Yale and became a professor at Union Theological Seminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| And so this is Conversations with God, Two Centuries of Prayers by African Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| And I'm going to read from a poem by George Thomas for our invocation entitled, Oh God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=56)|
| 0:01:04| Slow Us Down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| So if you could bow your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| Oh God, slow us down and help us to see that we are put in charge of our lives, but with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| thy help, help us to get in tune with the rhythm that makes for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| We keep moving, even though we know that we are made to center down, as well as to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| actively engaged in the business of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| We compete for things and make those things more important than they ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| We eat what we ought not to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| We neglect and misuse our bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| We fail to discipline our minds and to be still and know that thou art God and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| we are the temple of the Most High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Yet we often complain about our misfortunes and our hard luck, when at times it is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| who are guilty of disregard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Help us to know that we can be broken by life only if we first allow the victory of evil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| over our spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| May our hope and strength and faith be grounded in you, and may we recall the strength of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| our model, our brother and your son, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=131)|
| 0:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| If you'd call the new roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| We have three items to come before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| The election of the vice mayor, the election of the beer board chair, the election of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| council representative as Knoxville Transportation Authority member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| Just to kind of set the scene, the way we have done the vice mayor election is we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| opened up discussion, let anyone make a comment that they would like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Now, what we have done the last couple of times is that has been a discussion just among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| There is one person from the public who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| That is not a decision that council can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| If you want to change that and have public discussion added, you can do that, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| What we have done, I shouldn't say traditionally, but what we have done the last two times is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| discussion among council members, then we'll go around and let every council member say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| if they would like to be considered or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| At that point in time, then we would, once that first discussion is had, we haven't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| discussions during the vote, so you'd say if you wanted to be considered, then we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| go around and take the first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| In that point in time, then if someone had a majority, they would become the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| If they didn't, we would eliminate the person with the lowest amount of votes and go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| a second vote and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| So that is the procedure that we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Mr. Swanson, did I say everything right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| That's accurate, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| So right now, I would proceed to open discussion on the vice mayor spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| If anyone had some, if somebody would like to change the rules about taking someone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| the public to speak, you can do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Would we have to suspend the rules to allow someone, I mean, if they come here and signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| up, I think that would be appropriate, so I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Would you like, typically what we've done when we have people from the audience who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| sign up to speak, we allow them to come speak first, not just on this item, but any item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| and then we have discussion from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| So I'm going to follow that, and the person signed up to speak is David Buckwalter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| David, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| I am David Buckwalter, 2717 Mineral Springs Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| I had a stroke this summer, so my communication is a little struggled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Hopefully you can understand me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| It feels like I have something important to say, and it has to do with selecting the vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I don't think I need to explain to you the power of incumbency in elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| I think this year we have the very real possibility that Mayor Haslam will be either stepping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| down to run for governor or will be elected governor and be leaving his mayoral position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| early, in which case the vice mayor, as I understand it, will take over as the acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| mayor for a few months to perhaps even close to a year, depending on the timing of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| whether it results in a special election or goes to the general election in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=340)|
| 0:05:49| I think what I'm asking as a voter, as a citizen, is that you elect someone to be vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| who is not going to be running for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| I think that one of the advantages of term limits is that at least every eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| there is a level playing field, there is a horse race for the office of mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| And as a voter, as a citizen, I would like to have that opportunity to participate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| what feels like a level playing field at least every eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| I know the temptation must be great to play politics with this and to position someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| to have the advantage of incumbency to run, and I'm asking you not to do that, to seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| consider electing someone who is not going to be running for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| I don't know who is interested in running and who isn't, but probably you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| And I just want to say in conclusion that Councilman Brown, Councilman Pavlis, Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=410)|
| 0:07:00| DeVolpe, Councilman Grieve, and Councilman Palmer, this is your first ability or your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=420)|
| 0:07:10| first opportunity to make a decision and to act as a part of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And I think that what you decide here today is important in terms of picking a vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| because of the reasons I've expressed, and I'm hoping that you'll make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| The five of you obviously hold the majority, and I'm guessing that probably among the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| of you, you're not interested in running, so I'm especially asking you as new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| to get started on the right foot and serve the interests of the citizens and of the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| of Knoxville rather than possibly a self-interest in someone who wants to be elected as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| I would feel good about any of you being mayor, but I would like to see you elected on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=474)|
| 0:08:01| own merits, on a level playing field, in a true war phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| A discussion from Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Anybody have comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Let me do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| First, for Mr. Buckwalter and Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong on the process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| replacing a mayor if the vacancy happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| The vice mayor only holds the mayor position until the next city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| I'd be willing to bet with a planned succession like this would be if the mayor is elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| governor, the mayor, the incumbent would resign at the beginning of a council meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| there would be no time that the vice mayor we elect here would actually serve as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| That decision is going to be made by another vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| So it's something, I think your comments are very germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| I think they're germane for a different discussion from what we have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| So I wanted to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| I guess I'll also go ahead and say I'm willing to continue serving as vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| I actually have got excited about the transition work of bringing five new people on and feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| like there's at least a little of that to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| So I would be willing to continue serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| What are we discussing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| The election of the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| This is not the time to, you can obviously say that if you're interested, the next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| after the discussion is I'm going to go around and call on everyone and say yes, I'm willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| to be considered or no, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Ms. Ruddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| To clarify, will there be further discussion after everyone has declared their intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| That is not the way that it is designed, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| The way it was talked about being done and the way over the past few weeks we have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| the procedure for this, it was developed so that there would be an initial discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| But once the discussion was done, discussion was done, and then there would be vote without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| discussion during the vote itself is what you all sort of agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| But you could agree to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| These are your rules, and so you can make them up to suit yourselves with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I'd say that if after the nominations happen, if you feel like you'd like to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| you can move to do what Councilman Pavlis just did and say I'd like to spin the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| and you could have a discussion at that point in time if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| So, again, as Charles said, they're your rules and they can be changed at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| You sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| I guess my priority in terms of the election of the Vice Mayor is someone who can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| the kind of cooperative leadership, consensus-driven decision-making, transparency, the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=649)|
| 0:11:01| culture that we've developed on this Council over the past six years that I've been privileged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| to be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| That's a real priority for me, someone who can lead from the team, lead for the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| and with the team in terms of developing consensus among the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| That's, I think, been a hallmark of this Council and something that Vice Mayor Becker has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| He's taken on that mantle and achieved that and I think he's done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Councilman Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| I would say that I agree with that and I think that any single one of us could actually continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=697)|
| 0:11:46| on because we've all been influenced by that culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And the new Council members coming on, clearly, what's really exciting is that you all, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| not fully knowing you as people, seem to really embody that kind of spirit of collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=714)|
| 0:12:02| and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| On the outside, and I think Councilman Becker has done a fabulous job also, on the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| chance we don't speak, I would also like to offer my name as a potential and I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| bring some skills in terms of process and I think that we can continue even to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| creative about thinking together and I'm not sure exactly, I know we're always talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| about the constraints of the Sunshine Law, but I actually think that there's more that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| we can do around thinking together and also shared leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=755)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| I'm going to move then to, we're going to start, and I guess, Ms. Mitchell, I'll let you just go around then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| Mayor, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| When our name is called, will we have a chance to make a brief remark or could we ask to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Again, they're Council's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| If you would like to, if you all would like to suspend that, so if you would like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| remarks, I'm totally fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| I think it's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Would someone like to move that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| I thought in the process email that Mr. Swanson sent around, my understanding was that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| someone wanted to be considered for any of these three positions, that when they offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| their name up for service, they would have the opportunity to give a brief statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| as to why they felt they embodied the characteristics or the abilities needed for that leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Actually not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| That was for the discussion period prior to going around and asking each Council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| to express an interest in the position or not express an interest in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| The process that you adopted through that procedure was a process where the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| would be held in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Once the voting process started, and the voting process would be the mayor first going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| and asking each Council member whether or not they wish to be considered for that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| responding with either a yes or a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| And there would not be further discussion during that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| That's what has been agreed to to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Again, that is not saying that you cannot change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| That's just where we are right now with what you've agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| So if someone wants to offer their name, offer themselves for service and feel that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| have leadership qualities that might match the particular role, they should state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| before we go around in the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Now is a good time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| In that case, Mayor, I'd just like to say that I agree with my colleagues on what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| think the legacy of the Council that I've served on so far has been, one, the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| and the dialogue and the public processes and the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| And we've been a very hardworking body where we've had a lot of this discussion with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| administration in advance, which brings a really clean product to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And so I believe in public service, and I would consider it an honor to serve as Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Mayor, so I would be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| But having said that, I also think that Vice Mayor Brown really was our first Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| and he set a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| And Vice Mayor Becker has done a great job as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I'm going to go ahead and I'll let Ms. Mitchell go ahead and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| So, I have the folks that have expressed interest are Bailey, Becker, and Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| So, what we will do is in the first ballot, it'll literally be who you're for now, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| we'll go around, and if there's a majority, again, that person would win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| If there's not, we will eliminate the person who has the least amount of votes and re-vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Point of clarification for a new council person, this is a two-year or one-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| This is two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| This will be until there's a new council elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| So, this is a two-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| That's actually a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Just building on Mr. Greaves' question, if this council were to change its mind, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| since it makes the rules, it could ask, or does that require an ordinance to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| if, for example, for some reason we were dissatisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| The ordinance currently provides for a vice mayor to be elected for a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| and this is the time at which that person is to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| So, if you wanted to change that, you'll have to go back and make an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| I can't remember whether it's a charter change or an ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I'll have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| I believe you'd have to have a charter change to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| You're making a two-year decision, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| That would have to be submitted to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| And the only reason I ask that is I'm mindful of both Mr. Berkhalter's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| and the fact that I think the junior members are looking to the senior members at least to show us leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| in terms of procedure and getting the business of this council done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| You know, if this vote were being taken six months from now, maybe there would be a different slate of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| But I think since we're brand new, I think most of us, and I can't speak for anyone but myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| are looking to the senior members to help us through the procedural snafus and get the business of the city done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Sorry, Mr. Berkhalter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| I also wanted to say to the new council members there should be no awkwardness in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| and that we're all we like each other, we work well with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| and the preference that you may have for vice mayor is just a preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| and everyone's going to work well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I'll jump back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Having worked with Councilman Woodhull and Councilman Bailey and Vice Mayor Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| I guess I agree with Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| I think any of those three could do this job admirably well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| We've talked a lot on this council about the value of shared leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| and I think that's embodied, that has been embodied in how we do our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| And although one person as the vice mayor is sort of in charge of herding cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| I think, you know, the rest of us all share the load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| And there are roles for everyone, and in some ways it's in title only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| So I think any of these three gentlemen would serve well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| and would continue to promote that value of shared leadership among this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| Speaking of herding cats, we have departed from the procedures that we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| So if you want to continue to depart from the procedures we have adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| we really need a motion to change our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| If not, I'm going to go where we are right now is going back to the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Congratulations, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I appreciate the approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| And, again, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Okay, our next item on the agenda is the election of the beer board chairperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| I think here we will just take nominations from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| And, Charles, you correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what we've done on that in the past is the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Any discussion, then, on that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| I don't know that there's been discussion about this, about anybody who's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| My sense is that this is an important job, running the beer board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| and I know there's lots of good leadership around the table here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| and I'd sort of like to know who would be interested in stepping forward to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Other discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Well, I had six years' experience of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| so I would probably be willing to step back into that role if it was the wisdom of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| We're going to move, then, around to seeing, again, it will be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| This is yes or no, whether you're interested in serving as beer board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Councilman Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| All right, Nick, this is looking good for you, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| I believe this is going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| You only get one vote, you're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| I'm real glamorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Do we need to do a roll call or can I just do a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Just by voice vote, all those in favor of Nick Pavlis as the new beer board chair, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| And then the same procedure on Cat, Representative Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Discussion now on who will be council's representative for Cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I've been on the Cat, I've been the council rep for Cat for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| And when I came on council, Joe Holquist, who was the rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| very graciously gave me the opportunity as a freshman to take on that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| And I really would like to do the same for one of the new council members, if you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| It's a fabulous role, and we're online to open up a transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| It's an important role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| So I will continue to serve if nobody wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| But I can't imagine that, well, I could imagine a scenario where you might not want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1379)|
| 0:23:08| So I really would like to encourage one of the new council members to agree to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| I will work with you to get you up to speed on what you need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Point of inquiry, is this also a two-year position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Are they all two-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Is this in the charter as a two-year position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| This is really not in the charter as a two-year position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| but it says we're supposed to do this every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| So I think sort of de facto it becomes a two-year position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| because we're supposed to name a council representative to the CAT Board every two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| even though it doesn't specifically say for a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| I really think de facto that's what it turns out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| If I could follow up, just the thought occurs to me with the CAT Center opening in August of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| that there's a certain advantage to keeping continuity in these next several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| and I appreciate Councilman Woodhull's offer to open that up to anyone who wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| I just thought maybe the transition could happen after we go through this very important period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| but I'm just curious about the duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| The 6th District I represent and many persons from the 6th District are riders and users of that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1464)|
| 0:24:33| so I would be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Hey, Vice Mayor, Becker's light just went on or off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| On.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| You should always just take the default that I want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| I was going to point out we have this is getting into process stuff a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| At our next dinner, which will be sometime in early January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| I'd like to start a discussion about some of the other roles that Councilmembers have to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| There are a couple of other transportation-related positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| We've got a chair of a transportation and mobility committee and a TPO rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| so there's some opportunities if people are interested in transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| There are lots of roles to fill on that, and I want to say Councilman Woodhull has done a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| and I want to actually thank you for being willing to let new people move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| That's an important, I think, part of the culture of what we've got on Council here, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| We're going to go ahead to now back to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| You're just expressing whether you're interested in the position or not, so it's a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091219?start=1529)|
