| 0:04:23| Yeah. First of all, I would like to apologize because we were supposed to be here last month and I honestly thought it was Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| It was Monday. It was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| So I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| Second, all my employees have server's class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I'm sorry I forgot to go back to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| I wanted to grab that file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=281)|

| 0:04:45| This one employee that sold that day was a stock person, not a cashier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| But there is an employee issue all the time here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| I cannot find employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| And especially where I am, Strawberry Plains, the ones I find, I don't want to say that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| They are not dependable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Either they come to work all messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I mean, it's very hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| I pay $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| It's not like we are not, you know, I mean, it's very hard to run business now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| Employee issue has been a very, very major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I don't know about other businesses, but we go to church and we have some other friends and they are in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| So, you know, this was a stock person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| And cashiers, I have enough cashiers, but I had mentioned it to the cashier since he does stocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| How much can a person do stock all day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| So in between just start training him a little bit, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| So she, a pizza order came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| So she's Shawnee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Shawnee was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Shawnee said, Manny, will you watch the register while I go make this one pizza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| And that's when officer came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| I mean, I'm not trying, there is no excuse for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| It's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Everybody makes it and he made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| And he did not have server class because he was a stock person then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| But now he has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| But I'm very particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| If I hire a cashier, they have to have that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| And once a month we do meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| I call them to my house because I live very close to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| And my husband or my son will go to the store while I have all my cashiers, you know, my employees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| And I go over everything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| But this is the last place I want to be, honestly, because I know how I manage my business, how we run our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| But it's a mistake, and it's an honest mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| Mistakes happen, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=403)|

| 0:06:57| Can I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=418)|

| 0:07:10| He don't want to work on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| He just, he will eventually, I will, because I want to train him personally because he has issue with English a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| Like I said, it's hard to find employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| He's very dependable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| He, you know, my stocking, people were stealing me blind on stocking because the way my store is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| we have a building in the back where we bring the stock in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| From the back door, we had so much stuff going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| I mean, it's just hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| So this person is not stealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| That's a very big thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| And eventually I'll get him all trained, and I personally will train him because I don't want him on the register without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| I don't put anybody on the register without training them, but it was just one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Pizza order came, and he made that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Seeing no questions, I'm going to turn this over to District Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I do appreciate your conscientiousness of how you run your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| I know you are trying to be as compliant as you possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| I always like to know what I do wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| When the health department comes in the deli, they know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| I tell them, tell me what we are doing wrong because I take my girls to get the food server, too, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| So I'm very particular about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| But like I said, things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| You made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| They do, and we're certainly sensitive to the fact that employment issues are really tough right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| However, this is the second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| I know it's been over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| But while you're responsible for running your business, we're responsible for compliance with the beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| So in accordance with our procedures, I will make a motion that we impose, I believe, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| it's a $1,500 fine or a 60-day suspension, whichever you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| I'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| I don't want to be here the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| We don't want that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-beer-board?start=550)|
