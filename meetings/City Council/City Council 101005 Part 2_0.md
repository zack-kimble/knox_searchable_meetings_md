| 0:00:00| Okay, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| I wanted to ask along the lines, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3)|
| 0:00:07| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=7)|
| 0:00:13| I wanted to ask some questions about the restrictions and exceptions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:21| When you put restrictions on a piece of property like this, how long are they intact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=21)|
| 0:00:27| How long are they good for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| Is it through the ownership of the property or does it change when you change the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| The phrase that we use is that zoning runs with the land so that regardless of who owns that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| the zoning stays in place until it's changed or amended by the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| I just wanted to say that I think that we've really gotten off to a bad start on this rezoning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:58| with what's gone on before with the property and it's been said that it's an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=58)|
| 0:01:06| You know, there's fear of certain things going on and so we're off to a bad start and it abuts a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=66)|
| 0:01:15| although I think the surrounding area is commercial across the street, like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| Valiant said, and down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| And it appears that, you know, it's more commercial than it is anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| And as I look at, you know, what we pay the MPC to do and look at the staff professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| they recommended C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| And I just wanted to ask Ms. Palmer or some of the folks from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| whether it's Ms. Doka or Ellen or whomever, is there any room based on what we've discussed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:53| and what we've heard, is there any room for any compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| I've tried to come up with compromise from the very beginning with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| and I've so far not come up with one that was within the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| As you are going west on Middlebrook Pike, Pepsi is on the corner of Liberty and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| Then the next property is an R2, Westview Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Then this piece of property that we're talking about that has a house and the building in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| Then Keith Avenue was closed by the state 20 years ago, so it dead ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| It does not spill onto Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Then there's an R2 cemetery and then there are two houses that are for sale with some land around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| and those are zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| So I think the neighborhood understands that this is going to be a commercial piece of property sooner or later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:47| but to be consistent with the commercial zoning that's in that area, C3 would be more appropriate than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| And it's not that the neighborhood thinks that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| it's not a penalty for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| It's the fact that it goes with the property forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Ms. Doca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Polly Doca, 4804 Tomachi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| And as far as the compromise goes, I thought that C3 was an excellent compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| You know, the business was operating there and it has been operating there as R2 for probably a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| And at times it has been offensive to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| And our concern is, Westview is a member of the Council of Involved Neighborhoods and has been for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| and we do have some elderly members that are on the board of COIN that did not make it here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| But our concern is that the zoning does follow, you know, will be with this property forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| And Middlebrook Pike is a scenic highway and I just don't think that outside sales is suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=232)|
| 0:04:02| The other properties there are C3 are industrial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| and that's compatible and not a blight on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| And we would just like for you to consider protecting this fragile neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| When everybody's running, everybody's campaigning on we're all about neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Here's your chance to be all about neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| I'd like to ask Mr. Valiant, based on what you've heard so far in terms of some of Ms. Roddy's questions, C6, C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| and where we are with C3 and where there may be some allowances for restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:46| What would you recommend at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| C3 will put her out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| C6, whatever conditions that you would want to put on the C6 that will run with the land forever are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=291)|
| 0:05:01| She's wanting to run an antique store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| She wants to put a few pieces of furniture out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| If you want to say no car lots, no whatever you want, you can condition this zoning on anything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| And we've told the council what we would like to do and what problems we would have if you don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:25| But we're amenable to any conditions you want to place on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| Well, I'll just say this and then I'll hear my colleagues out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| I've heard from a number of different leaders from the community that have called to express support for Ms. Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| And the first thing they start out with is where we've been and then possibly what, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| where she's committed to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| So I'm just open to see if there's any way that we could offer any kind of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| or restrictions and see if there is a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| First off, just a question for some of our legal minds up here, Ms. Poplin or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| We're talking a lot about conditional zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And I wonder if either of you have opinions about whether conditional zoning is something that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| or should not get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| And I hate putting you on the spot, but it seems to have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| And I know we've talked about this a little bit in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| So I'd appreciate any input either you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Well, we've talked about conditional zoning on a number of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| And I have concerns with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| I've had concerns with it all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| To the best of my knowledge, there's only one appellate court case that suggests that it used to be very clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| conditional zoning was not something we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| Then one appellate court case came out in which it didn't have anything necessarily to do with the holding of the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| but it did say that conditional zoning was something that could be done in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| And since that appellate court case came out, there has been the assumption out there that it can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| and that it is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| I would much prefer to see a case decided where that was actually the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| and the court upheld that as the issue rather than in what's called dicta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| But the best advice I can give you right now, knowing no more than I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| is that conditional zoning is something that is being done in Tennessee and may be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| I would have to say perhaps more likely than not is enforceable, but I couldn't guarantee it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Quick question for Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| You said C-6 would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| I mean, looking at this picture, this is a very narrow front yard, 25 feet of no display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| And I assume that's 25 feet back from the property line or the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Will that actually work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| I'm going to go ahead and say I don't like C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Those people who have dealt with me long enough, I think, know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| And just as a side light, if it's a C-4 on Callahan Road, you don't want to come to the council meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| I don't much like C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| I think C-3 is still an unfortunate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| I was willing to go along with it here because, like the neighborhood, I thought that was the compromise we'd reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| I guess I'm also concerned at this moment that there's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| And, you know, at times when I've shared this body, we've gone a long time without that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| and then upset people eventually and just like to warn people there is no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| And right now we're not talking about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| We are talking about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I just have one question I'll ask Mr. Value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Now, you're saying that if there is no outside display, that seems to be the sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| That the business is just not going to be able to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| Is that what she's saying and that's what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| What I'm saying is what I hear from Ms. Brummett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| which says that if you display a few pieces of furniture out in the front, it tends to draw customers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| If you just have a bare parking lot there, many people pass that would come in if you had the open display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:32| It is a small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| It's not amenable probably to too much of anything else besides what she's doing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| I mean, certainly some of the ideas that it's going to be a car lot or something like that, it's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| She does not believe that she can stay in business if she's not allowed during the working hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| during the daytime, to display a few pieces of furniture out front to show people what she's got inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| At night they'll be put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Well, I've been down there and visited the place and that just appears to be, I wish we could find a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| because that seems to be the sticking point, having something outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| But I really want to maintain the integrity of these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| There's a house next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I don't know if it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Is that house vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| That house is owned by these folks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| The houses all surrounding this business are owned by people in support of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| that are here tonight to say they're in support of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| But there are other people in other surrounding parts of the neighborhood who are not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| So that's our problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| I've got somewhat of a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Number one, it seems to me that the owners of the property are absentee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| It seems like that what we're spending an awful lot of time on is the fact of what the business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| And what we're not looking at is the piece of land or the piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| and how that property affects the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| And that we're concentrating an awful lot on the desire of one person who happens to rent a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| who's not the owner of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| And we're not taking into consideration the neighborhood or the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| And I think that in my estimation that one of the things that we need to look at is we need to look at the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| and we need to look at the future of what this property is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| And I realize that one of the things we don't want to do is we don't want to put people out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| But at the same time, this is not a property-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| This is a rental business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| I just got back from Vermont where there are loads and loads of antique shops all up and down the roads there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| And I didn't see any furniture sitting outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| I did see a sign that said antiques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| It didn't seem to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| And frankly, it bothers me when I'm down in my district down on Broadway there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| Broadway and Central and see all that furniture sitting out on the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| which in that particular case those sidewalks don't even belong to the people that have the furniture out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| And I think that we need to take a hard look at trying to clean that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| But I think this is also a case where I do agree with the neighbors that spoke that they're trying real hard to keep their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:29| neighborhood together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| They're trying to keep a look in their neighborhood and bring their neighborhood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And I think we have to look to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| and the people that are actually living in that area in terms of what their desires are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| And I think we need to look at the fact that we need to consider zoning as far as the piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| and the surrounding properties around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| and not get so involved in what a business is in a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I have a question for Ms. Cash and then I have a comment on what we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Ms. Cash, is there anything else that you'd like to comment in terms of these types of businesses that you've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| when you've been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| No, ma'am, but I think I would be remiss if I didn't clarify something for the members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| This property has operated commercially for many, many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| It was a grocery store and then it was a TV repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| And only when Ms. Brummett moved in and started storing at that time things outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| we got a complaint and we acted on that complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| and she received a zoning notice of violation regarding the outside storage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| And that's when she came to our office and then she immediately went to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| So this is not this, well, as long as I can remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| and I've lived in Knoxville or the surrounding area all my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| it's always been a commercial operation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Even though it was technically, it was zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Pre-existing non-conforming prior to annexation into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I think, you know, what council is struggling with here is finding a compromise that's workable for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| I think council wants to support neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| and I think council also sees that this is a highly commercialized district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| and no matter what the business is that's operating there, it needs to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| And I concur with Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I'm not particularly happy with what's allowable long term in C4 or C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| And I know the neighborhood has given their stamp of approval on C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| but when I look at what's in front of us and what's allowable in C3 long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| automobile service and repair establishments, recapping and retreading of tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| I'm not sure that's particularly attractive adjacent to this neighborhood either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Again, I'm wondering if C6 that was approached that was recommended by the staff originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| with some conditions put on it that would serve the neighborhood long term might not be a better place to land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| And my question for Mr. Swanson is if this council wanted to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| and consider C6 perhaps with some conditions, does it need to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I think MPC did consider C6 and I think that's clearly in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Mr. Donaldson, would you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| I thought that was under the original application, which then expired and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| No, they considered C6 this time because that's what the professional staff recommended, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| in this particular case on this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I guess I know this is in Ms. Palmer's district, so I would defer to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| But I guess what feels like might be productive at this point is a four-week postponement with an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| folks in the neighborhood and maybe Ms. Palmer and others to get together and look at C6 with some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| I guess I like the fact that it has the site plan approval, which C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| and C4, to my reading, are just wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| And being that it is a highly commercialized district, maybe that's a place that we could land that would protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| neighborhood interests long term, no matter who the business owner is, as Mr. Greaves said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| and come up with something that makes sense in this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| So my motion would be to postpone for four weeks with a recommendation that all zones, particularly C6, perhaps be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:45| May I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Not right now, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Further discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I'm going to take the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Any lights now need to apply to the motion that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| As this has unfolded, Ms. Roddy, my idea about a possible awning about five feet attached to the building would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:10| extension of the building and the furniture would not be out in the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| So that was where I came up with the awning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Of course, I spoke before I checked, and that was not something that was allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| And I still am not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| C3 says no outside displays, but if it's part of the building, would it really be outside or would it be part of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| And is that a condition that we could put on a C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| This piece of property is really small, and so the likelihood of several of these options in C3, C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| is just very small because the piece of property is too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I think on a good day, if there's furniture displayed outside, three or three, maybe four cars at the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| can get in and get out of you've been by that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| So my idea initially was to work on a compromise, but I seem to not be able to get the awning attached to the building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| allow the furniture to be displayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| So if one of our legal minds could come up with a plan to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| that would protect the future of the property and allow Ms. Brummett to remain in business at this time with some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Well, there's a lot of things you can do under C6, and I'm not sure with regard to an awning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:33| an outdoor display, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I'm not sure exactly how specific that use on review might be, but C6 gives you more adaptability than any other possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:47| I think with regard to C4, I mean, with C3, you're just not going to be able to do outside storage as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:57| and I don't think you can condition C3 in any way that's going to allow you to do the outside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:06| You could do C4 and have limitations on what could be stored outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| I'm not sure you'd get your awning in there that way, but you could do C4 with greater limitations on the outside storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:23| than are there now, assuming that that conditional zoning is, in fact, enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| which I always throw that caveat in there because I'm a little leery of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Did you explain for all of us so that we're on the same page the difference between outside storage and temporary display?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| That is part of our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| That's why Mr. Donaldson is here because he's that kind of expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Because Ms. Bromant wants to, you know, it's a weekend thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| and I understand that the interchangeability of the terms is very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| If I might, in the C3 zoning district, it specifically says prohibited uses and structures outdoor display of merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| You can't do it in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Let me ask, I guess, partly for Ms. Palmer and some for the neighborhood people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I know all have a real good sense of the zoning issues involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Do you all feel, and you just had a little conversation with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| do you feel that a delay, a postponement is going to accomplish anything further in a getting a compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| I see you're shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Ms. Adcock, any of the neighborhood folks feel there's any, you don't even have to get up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| but you're welcome to come down because you have to give your name and address if you come down, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| If you need me to, Bob, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Hi, I'm Ellen Adcock, and I live at 3111 Ramona Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| And if you remember just last February, we were in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| and I am so sorry to find all of us still in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| and I'm sorry that Ann finds herself in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| but I have to say that I'm afraid that it is an ill-conceived business plan to continue to look at this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| and I'll try to point out why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| And I actually think that's why council is having such a difficult time coming to some sort of conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| and compromise as we have had and as Ann has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| But, again, just I know you've driven this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| I'm not going to continue to describe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| but let's have a little respect for the area in terms of it is next door to a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| It is at one time been used as commercial TV repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| but let me point out the difference in that in this antique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| The TV repair shop was rarely run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| It was a place to store TVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Barely were there any customers who came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| If you noticed when you'd go by, it was as peaceful there as the cemetery was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| And then you had the home next to it, and you have the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Now, let's face it, MPC has done a wonderful job of looking at it from a technical planning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| which is what we asked them to do, but they don't have the right to apply some common sense to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| They can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| They have to look at it from a technical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| We are asking you to apply some common sense to the fact that this area does exist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| And, yes, John's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| We have industrial in various areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| But does that mean that we keep pouring industrial into that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| when we have a peaceful little setting that as people pass by on Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| they can say, isn't that nice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| There are some pleasant places in Westview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| So, again, I'm going to finish up by saying I think the reason you're having such difficulty coming up with this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| unfortunately, it's ill-conceived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| She's probably signed a lease, and I'm sure the owners are trying to work with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| and I have a whole lot of sympathy for that, but it's just not in the right situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| I would love to help her find another situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| I'm sure you all would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| But we are just trying to pour something into something that does not fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| and I'm sorry that we all find our places in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| And I apologize to Ann that we're in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| But please have some sympathy for Westview because, Marilyn, you're right, ten years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| we don't know what is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| And she may walk away a year from now or two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| and we're going to be facing this situation, but even in a more severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| So thank you for your patience with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Anybody, any other comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| Ms. Palmer, if you'll be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| I'd just like to say that I don't want to see the community or Westview be for what they're describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:57| It would never be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| It will never be just a junkyard or a car place or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| It would be detrimental to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I tried to do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| There was a big dis sign out there, and Ms. Palmer asked me to take that down, and I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| Anything that somebody suggested to me to do, I have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Ms. Brummel, while you're up there, I'm just, help me here with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:30| On a percentage basis, if you've got furniture out there on display or not, what's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| I mean, Mr. Valiant said it would put you out of business, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| It would probably be the difference in that is that it's probably 90% I'll sit there all day and not see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:51| But if I have a few things out in front, I have good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| Good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| I mean, I can just envision a real nice little post type sign down low on your, on the ground there with lighting on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| that, you know, would draw attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| I mean, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I'd do anything I could possibly do that was legal at the codes that let you do about, you know, as far as signs, but I still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| I'll tell you for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| It was a difference on this past Friday of making zero, zero with not much of anything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:33| And on Saturday I put some stuff out and made $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| I mean, it's just I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| But they do not, they just don't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| They don't notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Well, that's my whole point is if you had, if you invested in some, you know, nice low signage in the front there letting people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| what your business was there, I mean, to me it just seems like, you know, signs unfortunately are everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| But I think a nice low sign in the front of this would definitely, I mean, draw attention to your business without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| it's just hard for me to fathom that it would put you out of business if you couldn't put, I've got this picture here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and you've got, you know, it looks like a nice table and chairs or whatever outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Yeah, that's just, oh, that's an umbrella that some of the community comes down and sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| and talks to me so we sit there and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| But I just, I really need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I have spent a lot of money in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| I mean, I've put new carpet in and painted the walls and done new air conditioning and spent a lot of money in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| And all I'm asking for, I will never make it look like a Broadway, the corner over on Broadway where the guy had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:46| he had a flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| I don't want a flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| And I don't think anybody doubts your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| It's the next person's intent, I think, is what's got, and the future intent is what's got people upset here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| But, I mean, it's just a suggestion on, it's just I've never been in retail, so I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| It just seems like a real nice sign that would fit in with the neighborhood to draw as much attention as placing furniture outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| on a temporary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| So, I mean, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I move, you know, I'll move a few pieces out and then I take it in at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I don't leave anything out at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Speaking to the postponement, I guess right now all that's viable in front of me is a postponement so that I can have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| and maybe the neighborhood and the property owner can as well to consider if C-6 with its conditions might be a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:42| I'm just not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| I know that the neighborhood compromises C-3, but I'm not comfortable with C-3 because of the ongoing doors that that opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| So, looking at what I have in front of me, I plan to support the postponement in an attempt to look at C-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| and perhaps come back with something better for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Let me just ask Ms. Palmer a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| I've said it a couple times in my years here where I've sat in a position where I think you're in and I've said it's hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| Ain't nothing happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| And council in its infinite wisdom has said let's try one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| And occasionally we've come back and there has been something that's worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| So, I guess my question for you is if we postpone and we figure a compromise out, will you feel better about things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| I certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I would like to go ahead and support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And I'm glad to hear that you're saying that that way because occasionally I've been surprised at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| And I guess I'm always an optimist and feel it's worth one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| And I guess with the neighborhood, let me say I'm going to support the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| but I am very skeptical about an outcome and I would expect that if there is a compromise worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| you all are going to have to be involved in it and be happy with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| So, I think I will be supporting postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Seeing no other lights, the vote before us is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| We're going to go ahead and go to that vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| All those in favor of postponing, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| I heard no's from Palmer and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Are there any other no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| So, I have seven aye's for postponement and two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| It's postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| 12G is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Dean Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| southwest side of Royal Crown Drive from I-2 District to O-1 District, CC Company applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| 12H is an ordinance to rezone property located within certain public parks from various zones to OS-1 District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Yes, Mr. Mayor, this is the one that I'd like to have postponed for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| I'm a little frustrated over the situation in terms of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| My original attempt was that the concern that I have is that we have a number of city parks that have multiple types of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| And I believe that what we ask MPC to look at was to look at these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| and determine how we could protect them through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| I realize and I have had conversations with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I do realize that city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| and the administration that we really represent the ownership of these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| and that we ultimately can make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| What I'm concerned about is that what I want to see is I want to see a full process by which the public can be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| if, in fact, we want to do anything in these parks besides what is listed under the OS-1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| The other reason that I was concerned about the OS-1 is that it seems to me that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| in talking or asking MPC is that there ought to be a way in which they can either amend the OS-1 zoning to include all the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:19| I understand that one of the concerns, and maybe Mr. Donaldson can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| has to do with maximum lot coverage in terms of what the existing OS-1 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| What I had hoped would happen is that they would come back to us with a way in which OS-1 could be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| so that it could protect all the parks in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| or they come back with a new zone which might be, for instance, zone PP, public parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| that would cover all our parks throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Again, the concern that I have, I realize that my colleagues in this particular group of council folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| are very much concerned about our green space in the city, the parks that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| and I know that we're all committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| But what I'd like to see is to make sure that these parks that we have, you know, ten years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| that something wouldn't happen where all we would need would be five votes in order to sell off a piece of property or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| So I have a real concern over what is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| and I would like to move that we postpone for eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| and that basically what I was going to do is ask Mr. Donaldson and MPC to initiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| and take all necessary action to complete an amendment to Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| The amendment that I would suggest has to do with the maximum lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| which I have some verbiage that could be used for that when we ask MPC to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| I think that it's imperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| I think it's extremely vital for the future of our city that we do everything we can that's possible to protect our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| and protect our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| And I know that over the last number of years we've done well in terms of adding to our greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| and adding to our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I think that we still have areas in which we can add additional parks and add additional acreage to the parks that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| and I hope that that stays a number one priority with all of us in terms of the betterment for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| So I would move that we postpone this for eight weeks and that we can have further discussion with MPC in terms of protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| all the parks that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Mr. Yelabovey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Yes, well, in reading this package, what I see is the MPC trying to do its job as the keeper of the technical zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:54| saying that this particular OS1 was really not set up to do what we're about to do in terms of trying to push parks into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:06| Now, I'll take Mr. Greave's suggestion as there ought to be a better way to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| and I suspect that our original resolution sending it to MPC assumed too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| It assumed that we could simply put the parks on the list in OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| I don't think anyone on this council is opposed to protecting parks and protecting green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| but we don't want to give them a job that has them torture the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| So I would hope that if we send it to MPC, it's to come up with the proper zoning, whether it's a new zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| or a clarification of an older one or a subsection that adds parks that are developed with features like ball fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| and other things, which they struggled with, if you read the record that was sent up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So I don't want to just postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I'd like to postpone with the direction that they do the technically accurate thing of protecting park space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| in a way that doesn't do violence to the underlining zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| I'm not opposed to his motion, but I think we ought to be more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| and give them the chance to do technically right by all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| I think the motion to postpone is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I have a motion to amend, which Mr. Swanson, I believe, can't be considered to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| It's considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| I wondered if the maker of the motion to postpone would consider withdrawing it for the amount of time to discuss the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| potential amendment before this is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| It has to do with there's actually two pieces of property that are contained in this ordinance that are privately owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| and I'd like to make to discuss the motion to amend to amend one of those pieces out because they are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| what does it say here, public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| MPC has taken out the log haven property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Isn't that correct, Mr. Donaldson, in the e-mail you sent us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| We've suggested that you take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Oh, that we take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| So, Mayor, if the sponsor of the postponement, the maker of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and the second are willing to withdraw, I'd like the opportunity to make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| Mr. Greenwood, are you willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Your motion to amend is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Well, yeah, I don't think we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| Well, I guess Charles, she can tell him what her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I'm not sure why I'm withdrawing my motion if I don't know why I'm withdrawing the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| There are two pieces of private property that are included in this ordinance that are not public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| One is referred to in here as the log haven conservation area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| and the other is referred to as the River Bluff Wildlife Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| The River Bluff Wildlife Area is owned by the Legacy Park Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| and that organization does have the intent when that piece of property is fully paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| and owned to transfer that to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| So there is not opposition there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| However, the log haven conservation area is privately owned by a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| It should never have been included in this to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| and I have a problem with sending this back and delaying it for eight more weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| and requiring those folks to continue to be involved in this process when it's not public land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| So that's the nature of my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Is there a way that cannot be taken out with the motion that's on the floor to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| No, the motion to postpone is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| It must be considered before anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| But you could withdraw that motion for the purpose of allowing an amendment to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| If you don't want that amendment to take place, then you just don't withdraw your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| Well, no, I do want it to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Then it would be appropriate for you to withdraw the motion for the purpose of allowing her to make that proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Who was second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| I think Nick was, and he said that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Go ahead, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Let me interrupt again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Does that mean that then I have to remake the motion or will it automatically come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| I don't think it would be necessary for you to remake the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| I think we can just consider you want to make the same motion you just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| And I will also speak to just in terms of our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| sometimes it's helpful to have an opportunity to discuss an ordinance a little bit before a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| I saw with the last piece that we discussed extensively because of the priority nature of a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| it does tend to curtail debate if there are other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| So I would like to make a motion to amend to delete the parcel of property that is designated in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| as the Log Haven Conservation Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| It's together mentioned with the River Bluff Wildlife Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| and I do not wish to delete that, only the Log Haven Conservation Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Do we need a motion to adopt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| I guess technically you probably need a motion to adopt and not a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| That's the motion to adopt first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| And then you're going to come back with the motion to amend, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Now we have a motion to adopt and then a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| That on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Now, any discussion on that motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Motion to amend is just the Log Haven, not River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| All those in favor of amending, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Now, we're going to assume that Mr. Greave wants to put his motion back on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| And your second is still good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Now, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Now we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| You understand where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| There's, I think, a parliamentary issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| But I want to talk about that second because I do want to have that discussion that you talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| My sense is that what you said at the beginning is what you're after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| which is we want a way that there's a public process that decides what we're doing with our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| And I'd suggest that zoning actually isn't the place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| I'd actually suggest that we should explore some other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| We should look at ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Having said that, I don't even know that a motion to postpone this ordinance furthers the discussion that you want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| As I read this ordinance, and Mr. Swanson, correct me, it's rezoning some pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| It really doesn't do anything about creating a new zone, dealing with parks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| What I would suggest for process is move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| I think we have consensus about what is on the plate here that the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| 8 properties that are talked about here should be under the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| We go ahead and put those under the OS1 zone and that we have the discussion you want because at some level it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| and that we not get caught in something that I'm afraid we're getting caught in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| which is we want to accomplish one thing and the only tool we see right now is a zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| So we keep asking these twists and turns in the zoning code, which we don't even have to follow in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| What we need is a solution that you talk about, Mr. Greve, for deciding what we want to do with the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| So my suggestion would be withdrawing or voting down the motion to postpone, adopting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| and then triggering out a way to have the discussion that you want to have about protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| and enhancing our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| So I won't be supporting the postponement because I don't think it accomplishes anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| I don't think it moves forward what you want and it slows up what's good for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Mr. Delval-Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Yeah, I take it the thrust of what my colleague has said is that there's no objection to these eight items being put under OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| MPC says they fit, so let's get eight under our belt and then find a way to get MPC to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:17| or we use public input to help us find a way to have more involvement with determining the future of parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| whether that be zoning or something plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| But I don't guess there's any objection to protecting these eight parcels under OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| I see that we're once again at a point we seem to come back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| The constraints of the Open Meetings Act limits very seriously our ability to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| and have the conversation that we need in order to ask MPC to do what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| So, Vice Mayor Becker, I'm asking you to outline a possible way that this could happen before we vote on the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2575)|
| 0:43:05| You know, I had my light on to start doing that, but this is off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| The constraints of the Open Meeting Act meant I had no idea that it was going to be a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| and what was being talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is I don't know that the zoning code is the best way to get at Mr. Greve's goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| of getting public input on the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Zoning code tends to be, you know, a different body looking at it, a different body, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| going through lots of rigmaroles, things come back here for ultimate discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| I think, one, the process would be I think it's a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| We get together and we look at some of those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I think we could be pushing on some of our legal people to think about what are the ways we accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| My mind, if we want to think about public, if we want to think about a better process for deciding what we want to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2634)|
| 0:44:03| parks, right now we are not legally bound by the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| So right now I think Joe Walsh could get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| He could build something in the parks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| So I think we've got to look a little deeper, and I'm not sure what the legal angle is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| but I don't think it's a zoning code because we're not bound by the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| And if we want to change something in a park, it's the same five votes to change the zoning code and the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| What it does, though, excuse me, I'm out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| What we're interested in is to have public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Now, what I'm talking about right now, Vice Mayor, is not having public input on how we go about zoning the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| What I'm interested in is we have 10 or 12 parks that are R1, O1, C1, they're all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| What I'm interested in doing is being able to go ahead and zone all our parks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| And it seems to me that one of the things that we need to do, we seem to complicate things, but let's keep it simple, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| And one of the things to do is to amend OS1, what it has to do with lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| And I think that's something that I'm not sure, and Mr. Swanson, I'd have to ask him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| I'm not sure that's something that we as council do, but it was my understanding that's what NBC would do in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| And so what I'm looking for is how we can go ahead and get these remaining 10 or 12 parks zoned properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| instead of having the mixture of zoning that we have right now so that we can go ahead and protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| So it's not a matter of I'm not particularly interested in the, you know, the workshops and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| What I'm interested in is trying to go ahead and get these zoned as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| I know, well, I guess Joe had his light on, but I guess my concern is, one, as far as the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| postponing doesn't change that request to do the OS1 revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| I don't know that the OS1 revision is what we want because I think saying currently OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| and Mr. Donaldson, correct me if I'm wrong, is designed for the large open spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| It's a place to say we want a chunk of green space here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| So right now the value with OS1 is on private property sort of saying this is a green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| We're going to say this is a green space and we're going to keep it as a green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| So I think even in the zoning piece you want, I wouldn't say it would be changing OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| I think it could be what you said of creating a new PP1 zone, public park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| that would involve the use of facilities and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| But I don't know that that gets at the question you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| But postponement doesn't get us any closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Postponement just says we'll start having that discussion in eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| I'd say let's pass this, as Mr. DellaVolpe said, let's get these eight properties fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| and start the discussion as soon as we can on your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| You know, how do we get the public process done right on the parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| And I think that might include a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| It might not because I'm not, again, we're not legally bound by our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| So we don't even have to change a zone to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| So I'm concerned about saying a zoning code is going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Well, what I was going to say, I was going to ask Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| is there a way, I mean, I understand how we could go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| and approve what's in front of us in terms of getting those pieces of property OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| Is there a way that we can add to that particular motion that these other parks be included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:53| Well, I don't really think so because right now those parks don't qualify because of the maximum coverage provision that's in OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| that would disqualify those particular parks under OS1 as it currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| And so what my understanding was was that you wanted to postpone this to allow them to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| and try to fix that in some way so that it would, in fact, legally fit either within OS1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| as I understood what you said, or create a separate public park zoning category that it would fit into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:26| and then move all of it into that separate public park zoning category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| That's what my understanding of what you wanted to do, and this would accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:40| You all are having a policy decision as to whether you want to, before you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| I mean, if you go ahead and pass OS1 for the ones that MPC has approved so far, then you've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| but then if you go back and you create, for example, a new public parks zoning category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| then you have to go back and change those again to put those in the public parks category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| So there wouldn't be anything wrong with doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| It would just be an added complication to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| So I'm just rambling now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| Did you have a question you wanted me to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Maybe, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Is there a way to achieve what I'm trying to achieve with what we have existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| Can we modify OS1 in terms of maximum lot coverage so that all the other parks could go into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:40| In doing that, you may defeat the purpose of the open space preservation zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| Off the top of my head, I would say that a strategy to create a new district oriented towards active public parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=2987)|
| 0:50:00| while keeping the OS1 for both private and public lands that we want to be truly open space preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:11| And I'm guided a little bit by a brand new ordinance that was adopted by Memphis and Shelby County just two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:21| where they did, in fact, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| They created a new open space zone district and a new public park zone district where before they had neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:32| Can you tell us a little bit more about that particular zone that they did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| Not very many details, but they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| One of the keys is good definitions, and they defined what open space was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| and generally it was described as passive conservation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| And then they created a definition for a park, and it was generally described as active recreational areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3053)|
| 0:51:02| And the zoning requirements are set up to reflect those two fairly distinct use types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:13| And our current OS1 is very definitely set up to create large areas of open space that aren't improved with recreation facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:26| Is there a way to take the OS1 in and have a subsection under that that would take into account all our parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:36| My initial reaction would be that it would literally be creating two zones in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| We would have to describe a set of activities that would have a certain set of regulations apply to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:51| and then another set of activities that would have an alternative set of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| Mr. Mayor, at the last NPC meeting when this came up, Mr. McAdams spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| and I noticed that he's in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| If he could say a few words about this, I'd like to recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| Mr. McAdams, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Greave, Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike, Suite 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| What is before you tonight is the report back from NPC on the rezoning of every city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:33| And if you vote tonight to pass this as to eight or ten parks, what you're doing is voting no on 70 parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:42| The reason that you should not postpone this or that you should not vote tonight on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| and should postpone it is that it isn't about ten parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| It's about every city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| And if you vote tonight on it, it's off your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| That's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Several months ago, you initiated this process by sending it to NPC and asking NPC to look at every park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| every park expansion area, and to look at OS1 zoning with conditions that would prohibit certain uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:18| And to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| And they have now done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| They've come back with their recommendation on every city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| And if you adopt their recommendation, which I adamantly oppose, you are voting to say we're going to protect these eight or ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| parks and we're not going to protect the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| We're not going to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| You no longer have a mechanism before you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| You're starting over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| If you want to, if you pass this, then what you started several months ago by sending it down to NPC to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| that would be concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| But if you postpone it, then you can give NPC the opportunity to amend the code, the OS1 zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| and then you could reconsider protecting all 70 or 80 parks that are not currently protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| I would also just note for the record that NPC's position that the city does not have a zone for parks is brand new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| and contrary to what they have always done and what you have always done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| because you do have a park zone and it is the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| It is the only zone in which a park is permitted as a use, not a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| So I think sending it back to address that issue is totally appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| You have 18 parks that are already in the OS1 zone and this was about bringing the rest of them in and protecting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| So a vote tonight ends the process and you would be starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| So I would urge you to postpone it and consider the amendment as Mr. Grieve has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| I think Mr. Becker wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Yeah, Mr. Mayor, we just said what we do is vote this and then start a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| I find it really strange that you get up and say if we end, if we vote tonight that that will end the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| when we just talked about how to continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Were you not listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| I did not say it would end the discussion, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| I said it would end the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Were you not listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| The process is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| The process will continue when we start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| I mean, we are talking about having a discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| The legal process is initiated by sending it to MPC, which is what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| And that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| For the process that you started several months ago, you are ending it when you act on the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:41| Mr. Grieve's proposal is to leave it open for eight more weeks while MPC reconsiders this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| and it leaves it on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| I would remind everyone you voted against this to begin with, didn't want to adopt it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| and now are again pursuing a path that would keep council from considering it for 70 city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| Go ahead, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| One, let me just say that the proper, I think we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| We can push this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Let me point out that I think it's creating a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| I heard Mr. Donaldson talk about the value of the OS1 zone and the need to create a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| We're in the process now of creating a new zone called R4 that's been three years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| We're in the process of creating a new zone called R1HK, which is four years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| If we want a new zone, I think we're going to need more than eight weeks to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| I don't think it's going to take near that long, but it's going to be a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| I think that, I mean, Mr. McAdams had an interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I did vote against sending this back because obviously OS1 doesn't work for all our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| and we do need a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| MPC is recommending a new zone here, and perhaps we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Perhaps we shouldn't because I don't know that the zoning is the best way to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and I think we need to have a discussion about what the best way is to deal with this rather than send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| At some level, I think we all know what we're trying to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| and I don't know that zoning accomplishes what we're aiming at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| So I think we need some more discussions about what we as council want to do on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| But if we're going to postpone, we have the option to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| You made one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| You said that MPC is proposing a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I haven't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Right here under the agenda information sheet, in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| MPC recommends to city council that it initiate an effort to create definitions for open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| and parks in the zoning ordinance and parks as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| That actually is a little different than a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| And then it seems to me that Mr. Donaldson chime in here that what I'm asking to do is that we postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:59| and possibly let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| It's my understanding as city council that we look to MPC to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| and come to us with possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| What we have here is all that I see that MPC has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| and where my frustration is is they've come back to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| here are seven or eight parks that fit the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| They haven't come back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| here are possibilities in which we can get all 75 parks in the city zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| and taken care of and protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Now, it's also my understanding that where the difference is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| it has to do with lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| So as a possibility, let me just read this so you all can hear this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| that under the article section 2.42 where it talks about lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| one of the things that could be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| and again, I would look to MPC to be the experts in terms of whether or not this is good or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| but that all manmade structures or features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| which has been seated or otherwise returned to its natural condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| and excluding trails, parking lots, recreation facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| and other park improvements within the city parks shall cover not more than 5% of the lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| If we did something like that under the OS1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| then we would pick up all the city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| So what I'm looking for is, first of all, something simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| something easy, but at the same time that we protect all our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| and greenways that we now have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And so if we send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| and I make this recommendation or that I ask them to take a look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| I mean, maybe we don't need eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Maybe it could be four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| But what I'm saying is there ought to be an easy way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| in which we can go ahead and protect all the city parks that we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| the parks that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| and the land expansion that we're talking about under the different parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| So I think with a clause like that under the maximum lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| we would take care of the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| and we wouldn't have to wait eight weeks or whatever on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Mr. DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I'd like to cut through this because the hour is getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Can we not, as the city council, adopt a zone or a recommended zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| and then MPC has to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| So why don't we simply approve their evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| which was professionally done, that these eight parks fit in OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| and that all remaining parks be put in either OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| or any other zone they think creating a zone is more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| Call it public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Call it OS2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| I don't care what they call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| The name is not significant, but let's tell them, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| we want a zone for all parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| and it may be fair to have active parks and passive land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| Let's adopt that and let them flesh it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| and we can look at it when it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Let's just get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| So are you saying still postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| No, why postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Let's adopt a recommendation right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| that says that we want to put these eight parks in OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| and all other parks in an additional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| They are to flesh out and get back to us in eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| on what the wording of that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Okay, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| One of the challenges, seven years on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| one of the things that I've seen happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| we did this, remember, with chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| It was like we had to do a whole different resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| on what zones chicken went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| because part of what we've done for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| and part of why things like R4 and HK1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| and electronic message centers take so long is we stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| and we say, why don't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Why don't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| And we don't actually vote on a resolution that says to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| What makes sense is to get some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| and I hate saying let's take two more weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| but, I mean, frankly, Dwayne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| that could be great language to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| But to say to MPC, we want you to talk about all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| and frankly the nine of us agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| because I can see right now if we postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| and ask them to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| and they come back in eight weeks and they say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| well, Nick might have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| why didn't you think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Or I might say, why didn't you think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Let's send it back and let them think about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We did this for, Dwayne, as you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| a year and a half on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| So I think the proper way on this, postponed or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I mean, you know, Mr. McAdams might be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Maybe let's keep the process open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| But the proper way to ask MPC to take that next step is to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| officially as a body to ask MPC to take that next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| not just sort of to say let's postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| and we'll sort of verbally ask something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| but we've got to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| So we might want to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| and come back with a resolution asking for what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| and talk about that resolution as a potential next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| So how would you make, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| you'd make the motion to accept, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| keeping the process open to where the other parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| would be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| It would be, I mean, I think since this is only first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Since this is first reading, we could adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| come in two weeks with a resolution to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| like we did on Hands in the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| and say we want MPC to do X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| And then you have an actual discussion about what X is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| And you can have, as Mr. Dellavopa and I had on that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| a question of how do we want to deal with the R2 zones, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| And it doesn't become something where we ask them to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| they come back, and then we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| we don't like what you're doing, but to get some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| So I would say get with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| do a resolution asking what you want MPC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| I might be opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| because I think we've got better ways to control the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| but it gets away where council as a whole is dealing with the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| and not, you know, I think this, and then they come back in eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| and other people voice their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Process-wise, I think that makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Mr. Greer, final comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| You can call a friend if you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| You're supposed to say that to Mr. Dellavopa, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| Well, then I could make a motion that we accept these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| what was it, seven or eight parks to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| as of this evening to an OS1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| and that we ask MPC to consider the other X number of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| in terms of proper zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| I just want to, right now we have a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| which is to postpone, which has been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| So just, we'll have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Or I guess you could technically withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| Yeah, if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| If you want to withdraw it, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| But what I hear you saying is a motion to approve plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| and there's no vehicle for the plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| You've got to have a vehicle for plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| The only way council can act under the charter is either by ordinance or resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| You don't have a resolution before you that says this other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| and it's not appropriately added to an ordinance that changes zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| of particular parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| That's not something you can add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| So what you had previously done was to say we're going to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| and we're going to verbally request of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| and they always do consider what you ask them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| verbally request of MPC to consider the appropriate way to protect all parks within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| either through a separate zoning category or through amendments to OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| or whatever way is most appropriate in their professional opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| You were doing that by way of request, but it was not part of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| There is no vehicle before council to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| Can you draft a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I can draft that resolution and bring it back to you in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| So we could go ahead and approve this and then you would have the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| But I'm going to need to know what that resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| And what Mr. Becker is suggesting is that you tell MPC exactly what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| and you don't ask them to give you the benefit of their professional expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| You just tell them what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| And if I'm going to do that resolution, I need to know what you want in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| I'm trying to sort through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Hopefully other council members are having a sorting issue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| If we approve this tonight, this is the first reading, the second reading would be in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| at which point Mr. Greave or some other council members would have a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:53| that would specifically tell MPC what we expect to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| I'm not sure what resolution you want at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| You could do a resolution saying to MPC, we would like an amendment to the zoning code that protects parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:11| and here's what we want it to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Now they wouldn't have to do it, but you could send that resolution to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| That's what I think I hear Mr. Becker suggesting that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| Or you could send a resolution to them saying, give us the benefit of your expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| and design for us, if you will, a proper zoning technique for protecting all public parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:35| and allow them to use their expertise and background in designing what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| rather than you telling them what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Those are just two different things, and you can do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| They don't necessarily have to adopt what you ask them to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| They can examine it and say, we don't think that's right, and here's what we propose instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| But then when it comes back to you, because they will have considered what you said you wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| then you can just say, booey on you, and we're going to adopt what we said we wanted to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| Well, we got back in the weeds again along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| And I just want to be sure that I understand that if we approve this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| in two weeks when it comes back for second reading, some type of resolution will accompany that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| so that we can move where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| That's what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| That's one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| That's a direction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| I just wanted to point out we're still discussing a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| That's what's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Mayor, I'm going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| And then I think we ought to go the direction I think Vice Mayor Becker outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| which is we draft to have a resolution drafted and ask the NPC, tell them what we think we want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:58| Or I guess we could do it the other way Mr. Swanson outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| But I think the cleanest way from what I've learned is that we ought to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| go ahead and postpone and between now and the next council meeting have a resolution drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| and then we can start the discussion and make sure it's exactly what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| and then we'll send it to the NPC and ask them to look at what we've asked them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| and they'll work on it, it'll come back to us, and then that's a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| So I'm going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Mr. Bailey, that actually made a lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| And as you were talking, I think I changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Actually, if it would make folks more comfortable, we could postpone for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| bring the resolution back and deal with it all at once then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| And I know sometimes people do get leery about passing things on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| That made a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| I think I'm the maker of the motion that said eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| I'd be willing to amend or change that to two weeks coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| We postpone this, come back in two weeks with a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| and then that way that keeps it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| And I think the second agreed to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Is that okay, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Mr. Swanson, the direction I'm going to go is we now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| the motion is now on the floor to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| Anybody else want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4226)|

| 1:10:35| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Since I held on to that so long, I'd like to recommend that we consolidate the remaining items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| that have to do with the 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| I want to apologize to my council members for getting us, as Mr. Palmer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| in the weeds quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| And I think we got to where I would have started at if I'd thought of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| I told Mr. Bailey he needs to speak up quicker the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| The motion is to consider all of the community fund grants, community fund requests together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| That has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| All those in favor of considering them together, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part2?start=4273)|
