| 0:00:13| since he's the first standing, to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=13)|
| 0:00:17| If you'll stand, please, and let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| Our Heavenly Father, we come before you just with such hearts of gratitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=22)|

| 0:00:41| And we give you the praise for bringing our hearts into unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=41)|
| 0:00:50| We pray that you will be with us in everything that we do, in our communities, in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| that we may always retain that spirit of support and caring and looking to the best for those about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=56)|

| 0:01:15| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=78)|
| 0:01:28| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| Ms. Mitchell, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=96)|

| 0:02:09| Okay, seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| I have a motion to move that we postpone for six weeks item 12C as in Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| It's not quite ready for passage at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| 12C and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| We've got some things vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| I've had extensive conversations with Mr. Swanson today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| He can elaborate now if folks wish or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| I guess my question would be for the folks, Mr. Donaldson especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| I mean, is six weeks a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Yeah, grab a microphone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| I think the postponement makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| I'm a little worried about the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| We'll have to postpone the movement of the Cumberland Avenue Forum District through the process as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| In order to keep this out ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| We've passed other forum-based districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Why would we have to postpone the action on that when these others have been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| Well, this effort was to create placeholders for new forum districts as they come online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| and to create some general standards that will apply to all forum districts by extracting from the South Waterfront Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=210)|
| 0:03:39| and many of the regulations that will be applicable to all of the forum districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| So we've done that in these amendments, and we've created the Cumberland Avenue draft to take advantage of those general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=226)|
| 0:04:00| guidelines and the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Mark or Bob, is there a time when, like, four weeks, is there something that helps you that can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| I think there's a need to postpone it for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| But is there a time frame that does work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| And then we'll see if that works for Mr. Swanson and some of his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| We'll work with the time frame of the council, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| We would love to move it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| We hope we're in pretty good shape for tonight because we're trying to get the forum-based code through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| you know, sometime this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Two weeks would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| You know, four weeks, six weeks, it all spreads it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| Let me just say, you know, when we got started on the four and the seven, we started talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| how do we get the forum-based code in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| And we went and started talking to NPC, law department, building inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| and it became very clear that what had gone on, all the additions and additions and additions to the building code had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| dealt with at the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| So we've been into a long process on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| And if we need to put it off and have more discussion, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| But we've been through a lot already as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| So I'll let you know that there's a lot of good support on staff for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Ms. Pillow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Well, I was going to ask Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I was a little surprised at the four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Excuse me, six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Maybe I'm thinking out loud what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| But I'm understanding that it's my understanding that it's important to move this on through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| And I guess I'm wondering why six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Mr. Swanson and I discussed that this afternoon, you know, possibility of four weeks or six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| I mean, four weeks would probably be acceptable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| But what I think you'll find if Mr. Swanson's asked tonight if this is ready to be voted on in the condition that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| that it is not because there are some flaws in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| I'm aware of some of your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| I'm not aware of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I'd like to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| Well, I would say that these are not necessarily flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| I wouldn't want to characterize it in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| What I would say is that the agenda information sheet indicated that this particular amendment to the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=377)|
| 0:06:27| was intended not to amend any policy or regulation that's currently found in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| It was simply to reorganize and consolidate the existing regulations, authorities, and duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| But as you go through here, and frankly, Mr. Frost has pointed out to me on a number of different areas within this provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| there are some areas where it's certainly at least questionable that it doesn't, in fact, change the current code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| and not just reorganize the current code with regard to some of the wording in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| with regard to listing of certain appellate bodies and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| There are a number of areas in here where arguably it may, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| propose to change what the current law is when it really isn't intended to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| So I think we need to look carefully at that to make sure that what is intended for this ordinance is, in fact, what is accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| Can I suggest that we, and obviously, you know, your call, that we postpone it for two weeks to see if we can get those addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| and keep this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| If we can't, we can then postpone it for another two weeks at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| I don't have an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| I guess that counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Two weeks is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| And we might come back and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Was there an original second to the six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Are you okay to withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Then the motion now is to postpone it for two weeks with the thought that if they can't get some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| that we might have to ask for an additional two weeks and then Bob and his group will just have to work with whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Yeah, I think all of us here think this is real important, getting this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| And I'm wondering a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Is this something where the proposed changes can get to us at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| So I'm sort of wondering who's making the changes on this and how all that's getting done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| In terms of process, I think the initial process ought to be that the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| and I ought to sit down together and go over this together and any of the members of her staff she feels is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| and then go forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| And this came to my attention today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| And so obviously we haven't had an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| I guess I just ask that whatever changes are going to be made get to us as early as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Because I think this is something I'd actually like to read and do the kind of work that Mr. Frost obviously has already done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| I think that's a very reasonable request and I assume Mr. Donaldson would want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And anyone else who's worked on this process, I think that we ought to be sharing information in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| and not just come back to a council meeting with proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| The motion on the floor right now is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| And this is 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Other items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Mr. Haslam, I was going to request a postponement of eight weeks for 12B and similar rationale for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=571)|
| 0:09:42| 12B, just so everybody knows, is the, I guess, the best way to describe the front yard parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Front yard parking zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| And we have discovered there are a number of problems there in the law department, codes, engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| We have several departments that have been working with the task force which was formed in order to accomplish this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| and the group as a whole with their encouragement has asked for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| Now, there are several people here who may have signed up to speak on that, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| The only person I have signed up to speak is Mr. Blattner, and I think he's probably okay with that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| The motion then is for eight weeks on 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Second from Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Postponed for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Mayor, I missed, and I don't know who was going to propose this, but this is a possible withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| Item number 11P I had some questions about, and I talked to Mr. Donaldson this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| and he indicated he had spoken with Ms. Poplin about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| and I didn't know whether the intent was to have this withdrawn tonight or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| And if it is, Ms. Poplin, I'm happy to offer that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| It would be appropriate for that to be withdrawn because the only reason that would be before you was pursuant to an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| under the growth policy plan, the local agreement that expired in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| Yes, I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Then so moved to postpone 11P, and I apologize for being out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| And there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Any discussion on that or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| I thought the agreement didn't expire until this December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| Okay, other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Okay, we're talking about 11P to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Okay, all those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Other items withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Anything else to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Let's just take it that way at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| We will move on to a very brief mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| I know we have a lot on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| First of all, I'm hoping that everybody appropriately took yesterday off in observance of Bob Becker's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Congratulations and happy birthday, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Secondly, you know, we periodically try to have walking tours in various neighborhoods around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| We hadn't had one for the last month or two for various reasons, people out of town and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| We will be having one this Thursday in the Westwood neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| That's August 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| We start at 530 in the parking lot right behind the Knoxville Adaptive Education Center at 5719 Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| right next to Bearden Elementary, or if you've been around a while, Old Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| if you've been around a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| And we're going to end at Westwood Park back on Greenbrier Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| We usually walk for 30, 45 minutes and have 45 minutes or so of question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| So, obviously, everybody is welcome to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| If there's bad weather, we'll be at the United Methodist Church right behind there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| or right off on Sutherland at 4407 Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Was that Bearden United Methodist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Bearden United Methodist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| And that's this Thursday at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| And since we're on a hot streak, we're going to have another one, another mayor's walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| a Monday, August 18th, in the North Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| The walk will begin and end in North Hills Park, and we'll have question and answer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| There's limited parking there, so we want you to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| We also hope you know someone around there who can park in a friend's house or neighbor's or somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| or to ride with other folks that there is limited parking right there at that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| But that's next Monday at 530, August 18th, in the North Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| And finally, online registration for the 2009 Covenant Health Knoxville Marathon is now available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| And the race is March 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| It's not too early to get in shape, so you can go ahead and register for that, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| He wasn't listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Okay, reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Okay, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Pertaining to the South Waterfront, there are two public meetings coming up based on the two different design contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| that the city has with consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| The first will be on the 21st of this month at 6 o'clock at Corbella Temple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| and that has to do with the design work, the streets and infrastructure design work that Vaughn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| and Milton and their team are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| They're going to present the draft design that they've done for all the streets and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| And, again, that's the 21st of this month, August, at 6 p.m. at Corbella Temple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| The second is at the same location, Corbella Temple, one week later, the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| Again, it's 6 p.m., August 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| and that will be to review the preliminary work that has been done by Hargraves and Associates on the Riverfront Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| and Riverwalk in the same section adjacent to Lincoln Street and west of Lincoln Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| Both of those deal with the same general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Some of you may have seen an announcement in the paper Saturday, another proposed development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| And this all relates to that, but these are all public improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| and these are public meetings to review and vet the preliminary designs that have been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| And we need public input, so we encourage everyone that's interested to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Any other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| 8A is a resolution confirming the initial appointments to the City of Knoxville Public Arts Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| requested by Mayor and Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Let me say that I'm glad to see this come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| I want to thank particular Council Member Roddy for serving on the steering committee here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| for her involvement in helping bring this forward, and Council Member Pelo for agreeing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| I also wanted to point out that Council Member Pelo's term is for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| She'll be rotating off council along with myself around that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| So there will be four other members left on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| and at that time council should look to putting her replacement on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| She'll be serving for approximately a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| We appreciate her and also the hard work of Council Member Roddy in helping to bring this to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| 9A is an ordinance to close a portion of the turnaround at the end of a 10-foot alley off 18th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| subject to conditions and authorizing the Mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=998)|

| 0:16:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Mr. Frost just noted for the record that he is abstaining from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1015)|

| 0:16:58| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I just wanted to say that I don't have a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| There are some concerns about some of the other issues, but overall this is a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| The billing itself and this seems to be very appropriate, the alley closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| I think the contentious part is the street closure, but it's a good project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| and I want to see it happen in some form and have no problem with the alley closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1040)|

| 0:23:21| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Quick question for Ms. Rojara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I know I asked you this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| On this, especially on the agenda information seat, it says that they're going to provide services to 1,200 homeless persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| and find housing for 56 of them, which seems like a way to lose the planned and chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| Do you want to make a sort of explain a little more how more of these folks are going to get housed and how this is going to work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Well, this is funded by the emergency shelter grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| And what we're providing, this particular project, which is just one piece of the work that VMC does in terms of serving the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| and providing permanent housing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| If you notice on the budget, we're really just providing between our funds and their funds enough money for maybe one case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| So one case manager placing 56 people in housing, we think that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| Most of the people that are being served through this, the 1,280, those are folks that are coming into this day resource center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1458)|
| 0:24:28| who will be encouraged to participate in the self-sufficiency program and to seek housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| And there's our hope to actually place more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| But considering the amount of money we're putting in here, we can't really expect more based on our contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| But certainly VMC does more in general as part of their annual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Counselor Hoaglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Ms. O'Hara, I understand that VMC's intent is to move out of the day shelter business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| Would this be, do you think this is the last year that they'll be coming to us for funding because of that change in focus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| I can't say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| They haven't said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| It will be the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| They have not said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I know that CARM is still in the process of moving towards being able to provide this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| But I can't predict at this point when that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| And remember, this is also a resource center, so they would continue to serve people who are coming in to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| not as a day shelter, but to provide, participate in the self-sufficiency program and try to get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1527)|
| 0:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| As opposed to the day shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| But they haven't said one way or the other what their schedule is on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I'm not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1541)|

| 0:25:44| You just, Madeline, you just said something that I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| They're using old language, day shelter, when, in fact, they're not operating out of the old day shelter model, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| It's a self-sufficiency program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| They're providing services to these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| But it's my understanding that even when CARM moves to sheltering more during the day, if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| I'm not sure if CARM is using that, what terminology they will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| But the, yes, please, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| But this is a resource center, a day resource center that we're funding with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| because the idea is not that people just come and sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| They come and access services, resources that will help them move out of homelessness and into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Mr. Mayor, our budget is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1593)|

| 0:27:05| Yeah, if you would, yeah, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with East Tennessee Community Design Center to provide $45,000 in community development block grant funding for construction design and technical assistance for community improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1627)|

| 0:27:33| 11O is a resolution amending the major road plan for the city of Knoxville and Knox County to change Loves Creek Road to a major collector street through its entire length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1653)|
| 0:27:43| 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| We do have folks signed up to speak both in favor and against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Signed up to speak in favor is Mr. Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Mr. Mayor, members of council, I am Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1672)|
| 0:28:02| I am here on behalf of Mr. Ray Pinkstaff, who is also here at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| Let me give you a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| This matter has been before you all once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| It was back in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| It came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| If you go up Loves Creek Road north across Millertown Pike, on the right is the new food city store that's been open a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1698)|
| 0:28:28| Just beyond that is a triangular piece of property bounded by the Norfolk Southern tracks and a paper Loves Creek Road at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1708)|
| 0:28:40| There is a roadway that goes up there, but it would have to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Mr. Pinkstaff owns that triangular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| It is zone C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| It is his desire to put self-storage lockers there or a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| The property might now be described as derelict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| There are people there at night who are probably using the property for purposes that violate state law and perhaps a number of other laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1746)|
| 0:29:17| The C6, excuse me, the city zoning ordinance requires that a self-storage facility be located on at least a major connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1757)|
| 0:29:29| Why that is in there, I am not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I have not directly asked Mr. Donaldson that, but I have talked to some of his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Self-storage facilities are very low traffic generators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| When Mr. Pinkstaff purchased this property, he discussed it with representatives of the Alice Bell neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| As required by the C6 plan, he filed a plan with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| And then we ran into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| It came to you in May with the request that that provision requiring the location of a self-storage facility be a variance be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1799)|
| 0:30:11| The law department determined that that could not be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| The only way we can see to do this at this point, I think to accomplish what most people want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| something done with the property, is to ask that Love's Creek Road be designated as a major connector from Millertown Pike North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1822)|
| 0:30:33| as it is from Millertown Pike back to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| Eventually, as part of a road plan in the area, there will be a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| Love's Creek Road will be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| That will require a bridge over the Norfolk Southern tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| That is somewhere on the county's major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| I'm not going to say that's going to be done anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I suspect it will be done later rather than sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| because there are a number of projects out in that area that need to be done as far as road work is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| But that is a proposed county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| We are here asking that this short stretch of Love's Creek Road be designated with the remainder of Love's Creek Road as a major connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1879)|
| 0:31:31| You already have the Food City there, which generates major traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| Mr. Pink's staff, if this is approved, will have to build that portion of Love's Creek Road beyond the Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1898)|
| 0:31:48| to major connector standards in accordance with city engineering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| So that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| We've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Here is one solution that was suggested to Mr. Pink's staff after the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| And as a result of that meeting, we have submitted this request to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| It approved it unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| As a matter of fact, on consent, there was no known opposition at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| I found out either Friday or yesterday, I can't remember which, that there was some opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| I talked to Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Gene, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| I tried you, but I tried late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| I finally talked to Mr. Collins today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| I'm not sure that he's objecting to the project itself, but I'll let him speak for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1956)|
| 0:32:44| But we know of no one who actually objects to what Mr. Pink's staff proposes to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| And we would ask that you approve this so it can go on to the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| And we would ask them to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Mr. Collins, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Mr. Seymour, I think Mr. Becker has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| The C6 zone, was that on the property when your client bought it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| It was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Did you get it rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| When you got it rezoned, did you say we're building a self-storage facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| That was my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Mr. Pink's staff never made any secret of his intended use, and it is an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Mr. Collins, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| My name is Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| I live at 4606 Washington Park, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| As I stated to you in my e-mail, I just can't understand how a dead-end street can be classified as a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| This section of Love's Creek is just barely one city block long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| If any of you are not still familiar where we're talking, I don't know if you remember years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| we had the Beavers on Love's Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| And they drew a lot of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| A lot of people came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| And Love's Creek at that time used to be a through road and come out on Mill Road where you could drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| But that's the same area we're talking, right behind East Town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| But it's now a dead-end road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| So it's just barely a city block long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| I just don't understand how that can be justified as a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| I have trouble understanding how a dead-end road can be a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| It appears, the appearances seem to be that what I was seeing was the appearances where that MPC came along and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2086)|
| 0:34:57| well, you couldn't get what you want because you needed a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| So let's change the road so you can get what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Now that's appearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| That's what it looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| This just doesn't seem right to me that they would do something that this would happen this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2109)|
| 0:35:18| I apologize for not voicing my concern to MPC when this was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| This is my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| But I am here to state my opinion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| If this passes, it seems a precedent that any street or dead-end or alley can become a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| It appears that MPC will help a developer who needs whatever they need to get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| That's, like I say, that's still appearances to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| They may be deceiving, but it seems to me that's what this request, why this request is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| I ask you to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Mr. Froslick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| I can wait until after Mr. Seymour has his rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Mr. Becker has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Do you have a problem with the self-storage facility or just the change in the designation of a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| Well, when they put the request in, you know, we didn't oppose to the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| And I think the major thing is just the ---- I just don't understand taking a dead-end road and making it a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2176)|
| 0:36:25| It just appears that we're just going to do this so the developer can get what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| And that just, that appearance just doesn't seem right to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| I mean, are you going to do this anywhere in the city so anybody can do what they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| That just doesn't, I'm not happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Mr. Seymour, you have a three-minute or two-minute response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Very briefly, I don't think Mr. Collins' concern that this can occur just anywhere is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2205)|
| 0:36:55| There are plenty of checks and balances in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| We submitted the request to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| It was set for a public hearing in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| There was no input other than us at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| It is obviously here before you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| It has to go to the county commission also because it is the Knoxville-Knox County major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| So it requires dual approvals by legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| I've never been through the process, and I've been involved since the 70s in land use issues in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| I didn't know what to do until I did a little research when this issue came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| And I wasn't aware at the time that this standard that self-storage facilities be on a major collector existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2260)|
| 0:37:54| And I have been puzzled why that requirement because they are very minor traffic generators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2274)|
| 0:38:03| But Mr. Pinkstaff and I are here to answer any questions you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| It's something we're trying to accomplish a good purpose, I think, for the Alice Bell neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| this property, and for the city at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And this is the only vehicle we have determined by which we can accomplish that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| In the past, I've spoken with Mr. Pinkstaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| As far as I know, he's a good individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| This doesn't have to deal or do with Mr. Pinkstaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Let me read some street names for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| These are the names of major collectors in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| Think about these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| West Adair Drive, Alt Road, Ball Camp Pike, Baxter Avenue, Broom Road, Cecil Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| Cross Park Drive, Dean Hill Drive, Downtown West Boulevard, Inskip Drive, Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| Maryville Pike, Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| We've got traffic calming discussions on Tazewell Pike right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Young High Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Those are just some of the major collectors in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| There's a difference between those major collectors and this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Those streets are totally paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| This street is partially gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| I mean, they're saying it could be a future major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| And you've heard they're going to have to build a bridge over a railroad track and do this and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| I don't mean to be flip about it, but that's like I'm saying I'm going to be the future king of Siam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| I mean, it's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Or if it happens, it's going to happen much on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| I'd be happy being the king of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| But I think this is poor policy decision in passing something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| that could be used as precedence throughout the city for different developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| different parts of town, and it's a tail wagging the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| I'm really disappointed that MPC staff even legitimately considered turning a dead end street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2403)|
| 0:40:13| this gravel at the end, that you've got to go across railroad tracks that you get stuck in the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| I mean, I've talked to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| There's no traffic count on this street that's been done to allow it to become, you know, a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2421)|
| 0:40:30| If it's in the future, it's going to be years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| And it's appropriate to address it when it has legitimately come a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| It hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| It's not at that level yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| So I'm respectfully moved to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| There's a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| There's other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| And so I'm going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| We'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| But, Mr. Bailey, I think Mr. Bailey was next on the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Mr. Donaldson, I wanted to ask you if you could speak to the issue of why a storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| which supposedly has low traffic counts, is required to be on a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| That stems from before I arrived here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| It could be a result that in many commercial areas, all streets are classified as collector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2475)|
| 0:41:25| And in some high-intensity commercial areas, all of them are classified as major collector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| Now, Mr. Seymour used the term connector street, which is inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| We're talking about collector street, the purpose of which is to gather traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| and deliver it to an arterial without using the local street network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| And this segment of Love's Creek Road would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| There's a fairly significant commercially zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| And it would gather the traffic from that area and deliver it to Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| which is an arterial street, which is the functional class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| That's the definition of a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| There is no reason that a collector street has to connect at both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| It simply has to gather traffic and deliver it to an arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| That's the rationale for our staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| That's my driveway, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Don't you think that's kind of a mistake that if a storage facility has low traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| I don't know if that's accurate or not, but that it would, the intent, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| it just seems to me that, you know, it would be required to be on a major collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| meaning there would be a lot of traffic, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Wouldn't that be the intent of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Presumably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Someone at some point decided that the traffic from a warehouse storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| should have direct access to a fairly substantial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Well, shouldn't that be looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| We can do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| That's all for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Mr. Becker, I think, was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Well, I guess two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I guess this is actually a lot of follow-up on what Mr. Bailey was asking about why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I've always heard, and this is my way of saying I don't think we should look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| I've always heard that part of the idea of having self-storage collectors on a major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| was to keep them out of neighborhoods and to keep the traffic out of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| And I think it serves that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| I mean, we've got some unfortunate places where self-storage facilities have encroached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| the neighborhoods, and this is, I think, one way to limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| So I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I guess I'm also a little confused about Love's Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| I mean, Love's Creek Road is a major collector now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| It's on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| It's classified as a future major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Well, but Love's Creek down, you know, not this side of Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| From Millertown to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| From Millertown to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Now, when Mr. Forrest read the list, he included Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| Does the section of Baxter that is, you know, you get past the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| I don't know what the streets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| It's not my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| You get past the fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It's really wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| And all of a sudden, it narrows down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And it is basically a one-lane street for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| Is that part of the major collector that's Baxter Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Baxter from I-275 to North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Oh, just to North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| So that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| The section that we're doing, does it – I drove that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| And there's a section of Love's Creek that's wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| It's double yellow line, white stripes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| It goes back, and then it ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| And my sense was that's where the road ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| But there actually is – there's a gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| It's not even gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| It's dirt that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Are we declaring all of that a major collector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Or does Love Creek end where the pavement ends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Does somebody know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Look on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| It's a – it's still a street back to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| We're declaring all of it to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| It's a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| All we need is back to our entrance, which is 150 yards beyond the food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2708)|
| 0:45:18| We don't – excuse me, 150 feet beyond the food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| That sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| I supported Mr. Frost's motion to deny because I've actually driven this street all the way to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| I was foolish enough not to stop when the pavement ended like Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| I was trying to get to the rezoning that we have later on the agenda tonight from Ms. Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| And MapQuest said this is how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| And foolishly, I believed MapQuest and just plowed ahead into the mud all the way to the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| where I found out it was a complete dead end and it was, you know, a little bit undeveloped, a little bit scary back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| There's no way in my mind that that road that I have driven on the gravel and in the mud at a dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| at a railroad track could possibly be declared a – what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| A major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| I've driven it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| It's just not appropriate in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Well, Councilman Roddy, if you'd used KGIS, you'd have known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| I remember when that section of Love's Creek Road was open – excuse me –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| and connected to what is now Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| And their old Millertown Pike and Love's Creek Road were both grade crossings across the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| And both of those were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Both of those grade crossings were closed when the new section of Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| with the relatively new bridge – it's a few years old now, but new in comparison – was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| And that section of road was closed off altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| Of course, as Mr. Donaldson mentioned, even the portion of Love's Creek Road that is a real road that's used by regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2818)|
| 0:47:08| traffic is not even classified yet as a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| It's identified as a future major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| And the MPC's major road plan defines major collector as a street that primarily provides for short-distance traffic movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2834)|
| 0:47:24| and primarily functions to collect and distribute traffic between local streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| and high-volume traffic generators and arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| The spacing of major collectors is typically one-half mile, and intersection spacing is typically 300 feet or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| So I think if you take that first sentence and the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| it is an incredible stretch to think of this as a major collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| especially since the part of Love's Creek Road that actually functions as some sort of street or collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| isn't even yet eligible to be determined or designated as a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| That's identified for future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I would assume that means when there's more to connect to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| So I would agree with my colleague's statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| I think it's beyond a stretch to think of this as a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| It's an attempt to manipulate our ordinances and the plan in order to make something work that wouldn't work otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2896)|
| 0:48:25| And I think Councilman Bailey's question about going back and revisiting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| and trying to better understand why the ordinance says that may be the more appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| And we may or may not want to change it, but that's the way to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| Councilman, I guess, Woodhull is next, and we'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Earlier you made the comment that this was one solution to your client's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| What's another solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Just what Councilman Hulk was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| Nobody can, and that would require a request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| since it's part of the text of the ordinance from City Council, the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| I guess a citizen could make a request to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| but it would have to come from government to make a request like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2955)|
| 0:49:26| I frankly don't understand why it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| I've made inquiries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Nobody knows quite why that provision is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| There have been some possibilities suggested today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| but you see storage facilities on all sorts of roads in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| I don't know whether that's everywhere in the city of Knoxville or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| but they're on a lot of different types of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Well, it's been so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I've almost forgotten what I wanted to say just after Councilman Bailey spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| But, you know, I'm very confused by why we're having to even discuss this in terms of a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=2999)|
| 0:50:09| Frankly, when Councilman Frost read the list of major collectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| you know, my eyebrows went up because I'm thinking, oh, golly, well, that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| I mean, you know, Broome Road runs right through a neighborhood, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| So I think at some point in time someone had to have conveniently classified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| so that it could accomplish something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| which is just not the way we should be going about this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| And it appears to me that this council should try somehow to go about fixing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| And I think that's what Councilman Hawkins is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| because do you realize that we approved a storage facility on Bridgewater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| right at the edge of a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| We just did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Now, you know, we didn't protect that neighborhood from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and I mean, heck, you can say, well, it's right adjacent to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| Well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| But on the other hand, it's right next door to some folks who have been living there for 20-some odd years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| and right across the street from property that had always been residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Now, you know, at the time I saw no problem with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| because there was an agreement that that was the beginning and ending line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| But as to, think about the one on Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| a huge facility there between Peters Road and Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| It's just right adjacent to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| So I don't know how some of these designations for these streets ever wound up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| I can think, you know, Broome Road was barely two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| And then a few years back we talked to the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| and put in a little more asphalt there so two people could pass each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| But to me, to deny this gentleman the opportunity to develop that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| when actually it appears to me that development of land is an improvement for that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| and it certainly is putting that land to a very reasonable use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| is something we need to be fixing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| I would just, I don't know how we do that, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| but do we say that can we make a motion that this go back to MPC for consideration of how can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3134)|
| 0:52:26| I'd probably defer to Mr. Donaldson on that about the best procedure to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| and how to accomplish something other than what is before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| I don't think it's going to come as a result of referring this measure back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| I think that's going to require a separate application to make that the alternate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| You mean an inquiry into their, how they classified many warehouses and the location of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| You want to take a shot at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| What exactly are you asking us to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| The adjacency of many warehouses to neighborhoods or the road network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| Well, I just think to have to play games with naming a roadway or a driveway or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| a major collector to be able to accomplish development is just the wrong way to go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| Well, I would go back to the definition that Mr. Holquist read and state that this is, in fact, that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| I don't think we've been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| I think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Well, some classification is done after the fact, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| But some classifications are done before the fact so that when development occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| developers will be required to build to the collector standards rather than to a local street standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| if we tweak the zoning ordinance, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Well, is Bridgewater classified as a major connector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Do you have something there that's a resource?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| I know Ebenezer is an arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Well, I understand Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I'm talking about Bridgewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| I've got it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Bridgewater is a major collector between Cross Park Drive and I-4075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| It is also a major collector between I-4075 and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| That's really interesting, isn't it, when that was residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| It's a minor collector between Coventry Road and Cross Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Yeah, I guess I'm a little frustrated at the way this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| I don't much like self-storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| I mean, I think they're ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| I think they negatively impact neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| And, frankly, I think this is a great location for a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| It's down in a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| It's behind things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| It's away from things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| It's a great location for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| And we've got this challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| We made a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| This council, I think it was a great decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| In a way to limit self-storage facilities from getting into neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| we say let's make them be on major collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| And I think that was a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| It doesn't protect all neighborhoods, but it's a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| It moves them further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| It puts them on a place where if there's traffic, it's not going down my street to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| And now we've got a problem of it sounds like, well, this is a great place for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| but the road's not called the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| So the council is actually saying we should change the law to threaten every neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| rather than make a change in this one street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| And I don't quite get that because at some level it feels like no law is going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| And occasionally we're going to get something like this where we've said something to protect neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| It's going to make it a little harder to build it at a good location like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| And we have a whole board that does variances of things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| Our law department opined that this wasn't something they could vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| So it comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| And, in effect, what we're doing is something very akin to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| I don't mind calling this a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| It's a wide street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| It's got a double yellow line, white line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| It looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| And, frankly, all it's going to be is an entrance for a self-storage facility that's not going to have a lot of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| but it's going to keep that self-storage facility out of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| And I like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| So I have a little – I don't quite see where people are coming from at changing the law that would threaten every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3384)|
| 0:56:31| neighborhood as a way to get this self-storage facility in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Well, the issue is changing the classification, changing the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| It's bumping it up two levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Let me – Councilman Hultquist hit on the definition of a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| I mean, there are a lot of things that have been discussed tonight that are a legitimate basis for denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| But it's to collect and distribute traffic between local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| One doesn't give – one street doesn't give you a between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Two streets, at least, gives you a between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| We're talking a dead-end street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| My point is, is that when you get into the twisting and the contortion of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| how does that affect what's going to go on elsewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| You know, are you going to set the precedence where future councils can be reminded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| well, on August 12th, you all let this one slide through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| So you should let it happen in other instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| You know, Mr. Collins readily admitted he missed this one at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| Things can get missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| We're all human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| But that doesn't mean when it's brought to your attention that you gloss over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| You really need – I mean, there's a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| There's a major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| It's on the MPC's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Here's a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| In my opinion, it doesn't meet the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| In my opinion, it's not a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| In my opinion, it should be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Councilman Becker, I want to make it clear that I was not suggesting that we amend the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| I was saying that's the proper way to deal with it if we choose to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| I would tend to agree with you that we don't want self-storage facilities all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| But I think it's equally inappropriate to come in and amend or to disregard the very intent of the major road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3503)|
| 0:58:33| and those definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Those definitions are surely there for a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| There are reasons that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| They're there because over time it's been decided that we need to have those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| And while I'm at it, let me read you the definitions of minor collector and local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| A minor collector is a street that primarily functions to collect and distribute traffic between local streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| and arterials and provides direct access to abutting land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| A local street, a minor street that provides direct access to abutting land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| What we're after here, what's at question, is a street that only does one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| It provides access to abutting land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| So, as Councilman Frost said, we're really trying to jump two steps away or up by redefining what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| And you can call it a camel, but if it's a horse, it's a horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| And it's of a different stripe than what's being attempted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| So, you know, trying to say, oh, well, yeah, we have definitions, but they really don't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| I just can't go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| I'm wondering if we could make a recommendation back to MPC to look again at the requirement that the self-storage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| where they're located, with a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| And I understand Councilman Becker's concern about threatening all of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| Is there a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| But I also agree with Mr. Becker that this is probably a great use for this particular piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| And I would like to find a way for this to work for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Is there a possibility that the ordinance could read that self-storage facilities need to be on a major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| but could be considered on a minor collector or a local street with some kind of use on review for special cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| Is that a possibility, Mr. Swanson, that something could be written to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| That's always a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| You can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Ultimately, the legislative body can change the zoning code in any way you want to change the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| I'm just looking for a way to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I mean, this is a difficult piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| It would be nice to have some positive use on it, some positive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| But I also understand not wanting to open a loophole that threatens neighborhoods all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| So I offer that as a possible compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Mr. Swanson, do you have anything else to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| I was just going to say that I don't know that it's clearly been established that this does not fit within the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3667)|
| 1:01:16| Because we have professional planners who are in the business of studying this who have determined that this does fit the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| And so if you were to go X number of feet down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I don't think you're necessarily creating a precedent because I don't think the professional planners are going to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| with regard to any street that you might raise with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| So it seems to me that there's a possibility that you could say for X number of feet down this street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| because it collects from commercial activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| this street is a major collector consistent with what the professional planners have recommended to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| You don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Obviously, this is a policy decision for you all to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| I'm just saying that there are two possibilities out there that you can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| and decide based on your own understanding of that what is the best way for you to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| And I don't know whether the best thing is to amend the whole zoning code with regard to changing the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| for where a self-storage facility can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| or whether the best option for this is to simply say this fits the appropriate definition for a major collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3743)|
| 1:02:31| X number of feet down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| That's your all's call to make, and it's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Well, I guess a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Just, Ms. Roddy, it again feels like right now we've got a situation where the exception that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3760)|
| 1:02:48| comes to city council and has to be debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| It apparently has to go to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| By changing it to make it a use on review, it's something an MPC can do, and if nobody objects, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| It feels like we've got better protection as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| I kind of agree with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I like the way he said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Professional people have said this does meet the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| We have the whole end of the building up there that works on this, and they've said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| And we change our policies all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| I don't know how many times I've sat up here and said to folks when we're doing a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| well, the sector plan says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| And we've made changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| We do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| We do those interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I don't see why this is calling, you know, if this is a horse and we're calling it a camel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| I don't see the harm in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| I don't think it's a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| People can come back all the time and say, oh, my God, eight years ago somebody did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| or yesterday we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| We can always do things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| This feels like the kind of decision that should come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| And I don't quite understand this argument over the definition of a collector street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| and why people seem this fired up about what we're calling a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| My bet is if nobody had that, the access to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| we couldn't tell which street was a collector street and which wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| It doesn't make a difference, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| So, anyway, that's my, I will not say anything more on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| Well, I'll just go back to the example of Bridgewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| You've got a few hundred feet there that's a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Then all of a sudden we're a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| Same street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| We haven't even turned a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| We haven't, there isn't even a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| It's the same street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| We're only talking about, we've segmented that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| I think there was a reason that was done at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| And, I mean, I see this as almost that same example of where we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| it facilitates some type of development along the interstate by calling it a major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| and then we go to a minor collector and then suddenly it's a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| And, I mean, maybe nobody sees it that way, but that's kind of the way I see this situation on Bridgewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| So it appears to me that if staff, as Mr. Swanson said, has said that this meets the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| then why do we have to, why do we have to reclassify the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| Or do we have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Just in order to have some development occur there where it doesn't appear to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| it's not in a neighborhood, it's not, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| we don't have the issues that we have in some of these situations that we have to be very sensitive to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| But I don't believe any of this property along here is ever going to get developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| unless we find some means of allowing for development in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| where probably nothing but this type of development is ever going to be approved or satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Mr. Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| MPC staff is calling this a future major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| Future is not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| But I think we all generally know what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I mean, I kind of take exception to a little bit of what Mr. Becker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| talking about, you know, why do we have definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Definitions are used in the basis of law that we have involving zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| codes enforcement, and everything that this city, this county, and this state can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| to protect property rights, protect neighborhoods, protect businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| There has to be a sound basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| There has to be a definition of what is right, a definition of what is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| or you don't have laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| I mean, that might be taking it down a slippery slope, but you see my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| For years, you brought with you the city code, the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| What's in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| That document was important enough for you to bring for years until it was beat to heck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| Stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Put on eBay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| But definitions are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| Go through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Go through life safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| It talks about things for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| And the reason in many regards is public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| It's also protecting businesses, protecting neighborhoods, protecting property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| This isn't about Mr. Pinkstaff and what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| This is getting in and saying, we have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| We are going to conveniently disregard it for this instant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| We don't need to get into, in my opinion, starting to disregard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| You don't need to disregard the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| When council starts getting into disregarding things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| that's how council doesn't uphold its duty that we have sworn to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| That's how city council gets sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| I would respectfully submit that you can't go and twist and contort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| and make this street the same as Alt Road, the same as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| the same as Broom Road, the same as Downtown West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| the same as West End Skip, and the list goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| There's a difference, and it's a difference with a big distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Mr. Harkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| The motion on the floor right now is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| All those in favor of denial, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| We're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| We'll go ahead and do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| I think the noes win five to four, if I have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| So that being said, there's actually no motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Mr. Becker is the light I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| I'll move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| And would like to amend to limit the major collector to, what is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4156)|
| 1:09:25| 150 feet past the driveway entrance of Food City?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| Past the end of the existing road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Past the end of the existing road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| With the existing pavement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| Existing pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| I'll second the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| The motion that was seconded was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| And it was amended to make it 150 feet past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Let's make sure we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| We, I guess, amended to have the major collector run from Millertown Pike to 150 feet past the end of the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4191)|
| 1:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| And, Mr. Pelo, that's your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| You know, there's something that has always come up, irregularly at city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| when things have been discussed, whether it's zoning or contracts or other issues like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| And particularly when they're up in the districts that other people represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| you've often heard me say, I feel it's the district-specific representative's duty to ride herd on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| I've talked to Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| I've talked to other people involved in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| You all might have gotten e-mails from Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| You might have spoken with other people on, in this Alice Bell Spring Hill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| You might have spoken with Gene Mathis, who's sitting out there tonight standing up with Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4247)|
| 1:10:56| Other than the discussion here tonight, what, I'm just wondering what basis is there, Mr. Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| to make a motion like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| We all represent everybody, Mr. Frost, and we are, as you just made an eloquent speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| we're supposed to uphold the laws and the good of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| I think that what my sense on this is, I mean, I hear Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| That's specifically why he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Because he objected to what's going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| We're having a debate here over the definition of a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| And our professional people have said it's a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| And then we're sitting back here and we're going to override them because somebody thinks it shouldn't be a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| I feel like the reason I made that is it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| And I think that's why I got elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| You know, I sit here and listen to the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| Now, I kind of came here thinking one thing and actually voting the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| This is a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| I do want to say that I think Councilman Becker made some very strong arguments and so did Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| But I think at the end of the day, when you have a tough decision like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| I think one may want to err on the side of going with your professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| You know, I respect Mr. Collins and those individuals that are here on this issue and actually was hoping to find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4340)|
| 1:12:29| to kind of, as Councilmember Roddy was attempting to find a way to get to the right answer and split the baby here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| But we weren't able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| But I do take some exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| And I do appreciate Councilmember Frost in his statement with regards to letting the district rep ride herd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| And that's why I sat quietly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| But I listened to that complete debate and didn't engage in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| But I do think ultimately at the end of the day, in order for us to discharge our duty, as he spoke to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| part of discharging that duty is to ultimately, after we've heard from the discussion and the leadership of the district rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| is to ultimately kind of vote the way we think is best in that scenario and not to just defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| If we defer in all situations to the district rep, I think that that may be a situation where you're not discharging your duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| So, and I hear his passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| And I know Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| And I know those individuals that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| And I know they're passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| But I think that in the end, our professional staff here on this tough call, we may need to heed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| And I've heard this counsel on numerous occasions, depending on which way the professional staff goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| as they feel their preference is, they want to either back it or not go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| And that puts you in a bad spot sometimes, Mr. Donaldson, because I've heard us make those arguments when we agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| that we've got to listen to NPC and other professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| And I've heard us make those arguments when we didn't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Some of the same folk say, well, we can't listen to NPC on this because they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| But I think when you have a tough call, and I kind of heard what Mr. Swanson was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| or at least implying that professional staff has kind of made a call here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| And when they make a call in a situation like this, we may be in a best position to err on the side of what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| And I tend to really want to watch this area very carefully because it's not far from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| And I remember as Councilman Holcomb was talking about when it was a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| and when I used to go through it going to Oak Grove and Amazon Church and crossing over the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| and when the beavers were there and all that good stuff, and go to that store all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| And I'm very sensitive to the neighborhood concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| But I do think at the end of the day, that piece of property, this may be a good place, as Councilman Becker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| to put a piece of, put this development down at the end of this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| and also make the basis what our professional staff has said at NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| And that's not a statement that I'm always going to agree with you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| And I do disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I think you get it wrong sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| But in this situation, I think it's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| And I think so deferring to you may be the thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| And I say that respectfully to the representative of the 4th District who does an excellent job for his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| You know, Mr. Frost, I guess you're very passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| And I've seen you passionate once or twice before on issues that you and I have disagreed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| And on at least one of those, you were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| So, and I guess, you know, the truth is I have not had a conversation with Mr. Mathis or Mr. Collins on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| I went and looked at this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| And I don't know, just a suggestion, and this largely is because I actually do have a lot of respect for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| of postponing this for two weeks to getting a chance for people to talk about this a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| and to hear from Mr. Mathis and Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| I feel like I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I've also learned enough sitting around this table is that sometimes it makes sense to step back and think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| I don't know if I'm allowed to make a motion on postponing since I have the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| But if council would, if council thinks that's worth it, you don't have to answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| If council thinks this is a good idea, I would be supportive of postponing this to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| in a way to understand, Mr. Frost, what you're thinking because you're not stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Would you tell my wife, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Is that good to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| That motion failed for the last second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| Yeah, that was a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| I still think we're apples, we're a little bit apples and oranges here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| We have an issue in front of us tonight, and then we have a separate issue while related to what's before us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| is the policy issue is whether or not we need to change something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| I would respectfully submit that someone at a later council meeting brings up the policy issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4612)|
| 1:17:01| and whether or not something needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| And we try to address this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| I'd like to, you know, in talking about professional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| I've also spoken about this with Mr. King and Mr. Johnson in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| They've got PEs after their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| And at the last time I spoke with Mr. King about this, he hadn't heard from anybody from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| He was actually the one who told me, when we talked about this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| that a bridge was going to have to be built over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| There are issues in the city engineering department if this is a worthy item to be considered to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| You know, I appreciate good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| I appreciate good engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| But you need to look at them both in the totality of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| in determining, you know, what policy steps you're going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| I think we have an issue before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| And then we legitimately have this other, it's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| I don't mind asking Mr. Swanson, upon the conclusion of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| to do, to take a step necessary to address the policy that is being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| when we have another issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Does that attempt to address what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| It might have been an attempt, but it didn't succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| So is what you're saying, let's vote on this and take up the policy question later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| I mean, you know, we've had professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| I mean, the city is, excuse me, council has taken advice of professional staff in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| ignored the advice of professional staff in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| And, you know, when the folks in city engineering don't know about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| and quite literally snickered about this, I've got some concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4731)|
| 1:19:00| I mean, obviously, you all know how I feel about this change right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4740)|
| 1:19:08| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| I guess you don't want to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| And while you're thinking on that, Mr. King, are you snickering about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| Mr. King, as a professional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| No, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Mr. Mathis is wanting to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I'd like to take the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Okay, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| But we've been out here an hour, so if you could be real to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| Gene Mathis, 5266 Brig Lane, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| The issue I want you to think about is if you do approve this to be a major collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| what other businesses will we have to be fighting that we don't want because they are now allowed to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| into this particular area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| So that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4804)|
| 1:20:04| No one's even thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| I don't have my code book with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| So I can't say that these will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| But there could be some things that we don't want if you make this a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you, Gene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| The motion on the floor, Mr. Becker, there's a motion on the floor and it's been amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| and we're going to move to the vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Right now we need to vote on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| The motion to postpone took precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| What motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Nobody made a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| That was a theoretical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| It was a theoretical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| In a way I'm saying if people want to do it, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Right now the motion on the floor is to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Is there a new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| I'll move to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| That takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| The move is just to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| All those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Were there more no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Well, you know, you just have a habit of this, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| There probably were, but they were not audible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Would anybody else like to register a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| I only heard one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| So right now the motion to postpone is going to carry, going, going, gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| The motion is postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4885)|

| 1:21:44| There was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Was that a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=4907)|

| 1:26:29| I mean, my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| It's I4, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| My understanding at some of the overlays, we've done only the residential sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| This was the first one, and we did the entire redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| I think we excluded Lonsdale Homes, though, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| It doesn't hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| It only applies to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5208)|

| 1:27:13| No, this is just the first overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| The boundary that we used was the redevelopment area less Lonsdale Homes, and this just happened to be caught in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5236)|
| 1:27:24| No one thought about taking it off, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080812?start=5244)|
