| 0:00:30| All right, it is 1130, and we'll start our monthly agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| And I'll turn this over to Director Brooks to go over the agenda items that had the biggest controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:48| You will notice you got an email earlier that stated that there are other items that there is some concern about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| but lack of time, we probably won't be able to get to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| So we'd like to keep this on from 1130 to 1 today, if we go over a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| But let's try to keep on that, so be cognizant of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| I need a motion to conduct an electronic meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| We do that, Steve, at the meeting, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| We've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| This is an advertised meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| This comports with the governor's, falls in the ambit of the governor's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| I'll make a motion that we conduct our virtual agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| For procedural purposes, I would think we'd have to vote to even call to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:43| Are we OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Yeah, you're OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| You're OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Just that emotional spice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| So we have a motion by, who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=111)|

| 0:03:11| Is that what we agree on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=191)|

| 0:03:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| I'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Amy, do you want to go ahead and start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| I have a brief report that I'll provide to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| We also have a brief training that Alex Indle is going to do for the case map viewer, and then we'll get into the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| So good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| For those of you listening to our meeting today, I'm Amy Brooks, interim director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| And like I said, I have a few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Virtual meetings, as you all are aware, and we just discussed, Governor Lee has extended the virtual meeting option through the end of this month for all governing bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| And so planning staff will host all of our public meetings virtually through the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| We will reassess future meetings and consultation with the executive committee as we get closer to the 1st of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| I promised to give you all a little more notice than I did this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| We have a few projects moving forward that are currently underway that I just wanted to make you all aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| Transportation Planning is engaging a consulting firm to provide services related to a project called Regional Pavement Management System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:36| And this will involve the collection and study of pavement condition data for multiple jurisdictions within our planning area for the Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:46| And planning hopes to have a firm on board at the 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| There's also a Transportation Corridor Study that will begin after the 1st of the year to evaluate North Shore Drive from Lions View Pike to Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| This has been on our work program for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| This study will primarily be evaluating major safety and operational improvements such as intersection improvements, turn lanes, and other strategies for this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=300)|
| 0:05:10| They're anticipating that this will take about six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| The annual updates that our staff does for Knox County Schools enrollment projections is currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| And we also have some staff working on visualization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| This will be a tool for the use of this body as well as County Commission, City Council, and the community to look at what development density actually looks like as it relates to our zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:37| So that should hopefully be a really useful tool and sometime over the next year we'll be able to share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| And I hope that you all had a few minutes to look at the email that Allie Ketron from our staff sent out, I believe last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| It is our Senior Population in Knox County Technical Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| This is a very interesting report and I really encourage you all to take a look at it as part of our technical report series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| And it specifically talks about the baby boomers entering into their senior years and sort of how this can potentially create opportunities and challenges for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=361)|
| 0:06:12| And a brief update on our planned residential zone work that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| Planning staff along with Knox County engineering staff met with representatives from some folks from the development community late last week as part of a somewhat regular meeting that we have with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=377)|
| 0:06:28| to talk about things that are going on in planning as well as with Knox County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| We let them know that the review of this residential zone is currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| We solicit some initial feedback from them and then shared with them what our schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| And our staff is hoping to finalize that online survey that I mentioned last month to gather initial input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| So be on the lookout for that. We'll share that with you via your commission email and share that out with groups and other interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| We're also working with Knox County staff to set up a community advisor group to provide input into any proposed revisions of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| And we anticipate discussing this in more depth at your workshop retreat in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| And finally, I wanted to mention that the executive committee recommended approval of planning's final work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| It's agenda item 10B-20-OB on September 21st. It is an ambitious work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| It was reviewed by the Planning Commission last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| And the final draft, the reason the delay in that recommendation for approval was that we were just pending confirmation of planning's budget allocations from the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:38| As you all are probably aware, with the onset of COVID, there was just some concern that maybe we might need to make some adjustments to that work program based on those final allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=458)|
| 0:07:52| So are there any questions or comments from the commission before I introduce our speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Did you have to make adjustments to the work program based on COVID or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| No, luckily we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| Okay, so now we'd like to provide you all with a brief tutorial on how to use our planning case map tool that's available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| This tool is one you can use to explore current cases, but also to retrieve historic information for nearly 20,000 other Planning Commission items dating back to, I believe, the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:30| So Alex Zindel is a senior member of our Information Services team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| He has been with us for 15 years, and we're really fortunate to have someone of his caliber leading our GIS work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| So Alex is going to walk you through this planning cases tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Well, as Amy mentioned, I have been working with Knoxville-Knox County Planning for 15 years and about a year into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=526)|
| 0:08:59| One of the first projects I worked on was consolidating all the information about the locations of previous cases that have come before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| They were scattered in a number of places, and now we have them in one centralized database that can be searched as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| Just really quick, I remember the first time I heard the acronym GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| I was like, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| And then somebody said, well, it's geographic information systems, what it stands for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| And again, I was like, okay, that helps, but I'm still not exactly sure what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| I think almost everybody is familiar with information systems of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| You know, Amazon tracks all your orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| The DMV tracks, you know, your driver's license number, your vehicle registration, whether it's expired, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| But what makes geographic information systems a little bit different is that you get locational information, such as latitude, longitude, parcel ID, or in the case that we're going to see here, where previous rezoning cases are and where even current zoning cases are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:10:01| So with GIS, you get the what and the where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Really briefly, you'll probably hear KGIS a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| So what is KGIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| It's a centralized GIS system for the city, the county, and KEB, rather than, you know, each of these organizations paying for their individual GIS systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:22| They decided to invest in one centralized system and save a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| You can see on the left, you know, a lot of city, county organizations are connected directly to KGIS's database server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:38| You know, the city 311 office uses it, and the county, you know, stormwater engineering is both putting information in and getting information out, same as KEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:50| Us here at planning, we have a number of map layers in the KGIS database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| So the zoning right here, you know, when you, the planning commission approves a case and the city council or county commission approves it as well, we go in and edit the zoning layer, which is stored in the KGIS database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:12| And then once we make that zoning layer change, you know, it's accessible to the public on a number of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Hey, Alex, sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Are you, are you sharing a screen right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Are you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| I was meaning to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| I didn't hit that last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| It's popping up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| So yes, to back up a little bit, KGIS is a centralized database and geographic information system that all these organizations, including us, use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:46| And as I was mentioning, when a zoning change has happened, we'll update the KGIS database, and then everybody on the public can see that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=706)|
| 0:11:57| But what we're going to do is focus on this planning cases viewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| So I'm going to back out of that and show you how you can get to this if you go to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:15| And you look at the planning commission meeting updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| This maps button right here starts the planning cases viewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| And let's see if I can open another tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| While that's loading, you can also get to it through the KGIS homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| And it's thinking that I am logged in, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| But if you go to the KGIS homepage, KGIS.org, it will allow you to get to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| There's a big link on the first page, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| So this is our planning cases viewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| When it first opens, it shows all of the active cases on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| So as you can see, there's a lot of October cases on the upcoming agenda, as well as a few items that have been postponed from previous agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:07| We update this active cases layer when the preliminary agenda is posted on the third, three weeks, three Fridays before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:17| So when you get the preliminary agenda, this map will update and show all of the cases on that upcoming agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| So to navigate this map, you can zoom in using this plus button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| You can drag with your mouse to zoom into different parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| Another way of doing it, if you hold down your shift key and drag a box, it will zoom into that particular part of the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=815)|
| 0:13:45| So you can also use the search box up here if you get an email from a concerned citizen about the rezoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:54| You can enter it into the search box in the top right corner, and it will find it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| When you click on it, it will tell you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| So we are trying not to do that in this tour, but trying to keep the guidelines that you all want in place in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| So there will probably be videos and pictures you won't want to use because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| Right. Is somebody else here in another conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| Or is it just me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| There's somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Yeah, somebody's got their mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Yeah, they've been muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Alex, I don't know when you want to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I just had a quick observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| When I print, I always print that out when I go to site plans, and the yellow font is really hard to read on a printout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=874)|
| 0:14:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Consider perhaps another color or if any of the other commissioners have that same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| All right, I will make a note of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Yes, finding free colors has been a bit of a challenge because we have so many different case types in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| but we can look at that and possibly making that a darker color as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| But we can go back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| Once you zoom to an area as well, you can click on a case, and it will list all the cases in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| When it first opens, you get basic information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| You click on it, you get a lot more detailed information as well, including the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| You see these are pretty much the exact same staff report that you see when you get your agenda packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=929)|
| 0:15:38| And I'm waiting for that to open because if you've ever noticed on your agenda packages, you have this link as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:47| and it will open up the exact same cases viewer, but it will drive specifically to that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| But in the interest of time, we won't wait for that to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| The search bar can also search for addresses, 400 Main Street, which is the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| And it will drive you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| There's also some place names searched, like North Shore Elementary as well, so public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| It will drive you to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| So that kind of wraps up how you navigate and how you search for different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Next, we want to look at the different map layers that are available for you to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| You can either click this layers tab or this I want to change the visible map layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| So as I mentioned, the active cases are displayed by default, but you can turn on all of the planning cases that go back historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:57| So if you're familiar with North Shore Town Center, it's been under a lot of different development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| You can tell that there are quite a number of cases here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| So you can click a particular area and again, you'll get a list of all the previous cases that have happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| And, you know, you click on them for more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| You see the historic site plans and everything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Going back to the layers, we got quite a number of them in here, but I'll just highlight a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| So if you turn on FEMA flood zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| You can see the FEMA flood ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| I believe this is the area along North Shore Drive that got a lot of media attention during the recent floods in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| And as I imagine that this is going to be addressed in the new North Shore corridor study that's coming along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| And then we also have hillside and ridgetop protection area and the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| And while that's loading, I want to go ahead and point out that you can expand all of these to get a legend for what you're looking at right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:10| But we have the hillside ridgetop protection area overlay as long as the percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| Zoom in and get very high details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| And then as you can imagine, I'll turn off all this percent slope and the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| So I have other layers here near the bottom, the most recent aerial photography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| A couple of years worth of photography going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Obviously zoning is highly relevant to what you guys do so you can see what the zoning for particular cases as well as the surrounding zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:51| And that is about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Over here in the top right, we have a number of tools on this toolbar that opens up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| When I first started working with GIS, I kind of learned that you can look at so many different map layers of an area, even aerial photography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1144)|
| 0:19:14| Here we're seeing parcels and building footprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| So you have an idea that this is very developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| This area probably isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| But nothing really beats actually going to a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| So if you've ever used Google Street View, it's integrated into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| Sometimes it helps to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| I have something blocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| So the Google Street View window will open if you push this, create, center the map on this view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| That will open up this window so you can pan around and see what is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| This little icon on the map changes as you pan and zoom around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| So if you've got an upcoming rezoning case right here and you want to just kind of see how it looks and feels, you can look at it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| So this is about as close as you can get to actually go into a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| But the problem with Google Street View is that it's not located everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| It's only on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| So we also have these 360-degree aerials or oblique imagery or also known as pictometry as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1222)|
| 0:20:31| So these are like aerial photos, but they're shot at a 45-degree angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| You can rotate the view right here as well so you can face other directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| Where did the icon go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| There is also an icon that shows you where the view is centered and which direction it's looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:55| You can also select a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| So now we're looking at the February 2020 imagery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| If you want to go back in time and see how an area has developed over time, I believe these go back to, wow, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1262)|
| 0:21:11| There are also a number of other tools on the toolbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| In the interest of time, we won't get into all of them, but you can get a slope profile of an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| You can measure both distance and areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| They're fairly intuitive, but if you have any questions about it, there's also this help document as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:39| We click that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Alice, can I ask a quick question at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| What is the degree of accuracy on your parcel and your building footprints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| When we're measuring, it would be good to know with a plus or minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| Yes, that is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Parcels are created for tax inventory purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| So when KGIS started, gosh, in the late 80s, it was one of the first projects that they undertook was to map out all the parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1326)|
| 0:22:16| and they really took literal paper maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| In extreme cases, it was meets and bounds, which says starting where First Creek flows under Nalin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| go 200 feet to the north to the big oak tree and turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| So that's how parcels started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| And in areas where there are new subdivisions, surveyors have to go out and plot a new parcel boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:45| And as those surveys turn in their survey data to the county and they update the parcels in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| the parcel boundaries do get better and better and improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| Say this subdivision just came in right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| It could also improve the parcel boundary for this adjoining parcel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| They are very close but not precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| If anybody has any type of land property dispute, it's really a good idea to get the land surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| But for the most part, you can get a good idea of how large a parcel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| The building footprints are digitized off of the aerial photography, so I think that they're fairly accurate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:33| And one last little bit is KGIS maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| It doesn't recognize me right here, but you can also launch KGIS maps as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1420)|
| 0:23:52| This is also publicly available on the KGIS webpage, so the public is probably a lot more familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| You've got a few more types of zones that you can look up in addition to all of our planning zones in the planning cases viewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:24:08| But if anybody has any questions, I'd be glad to answer any other ones for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1448)|
| 0:24:17| Any questions for Alex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Just another real quick one. The topography map, is that LIDAR or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Yes, it is LIDAR based. So we can turn this back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| So if you never heard the term LIDAR before, let's see what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| There's the percent slope. And at the very top here, we also have contours that you can turn on the map separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| But LIDAR data stands for Light Detection and Ranging. It's very high precision, precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| A plane flies over and shoots down a pulse of laser beam pulses that land on the ground, I believe every square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| So you get an elevation measurement for every square foot throughout the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| And then they do base these slope maps and the contours off of that LIDAR data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| So yes, the elevation data is quite precise throughout the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| At times, it's pretty, you know, very positively astonishing how well, you know, a GIS can handle such highly detailed data over an area the size of a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:34| But yes, the elevation data is quite accurate. It's tied to control points on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| So the same control points that a surveyor would tie into, all of the LIDAR data has been geo-referenced in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:50| So this is something that's quite precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| Well, if you have any additional questions, as you, you know, explore this, you are more than welcome to get in touch with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:26:07| If you're not able to get me, you're also welcome to talk to Nick Shaneborn, who's also moderating a lot of these meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| But you have my email and my phone number, and don't be afraid to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you, Alex. Very informative. That's very helpful for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| And I will let you guys carry on from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| Thanks, Alex. Let me stop sharing. It looks like I did stop, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| You did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Okay, we can dive into agenda items now, when we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| So agenda item number seven, AF20RZ8B20SP, it's Metro Trailer Repair Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| This applicant is requesting consideration of a rezoning from CA and ACT Industrial to allow the existing tractor trailer repair business to legally operate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| So Michelle Porche is going to review this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Thanks, Amy. This property is out in the county on Rutledge Pike, pretty close to city-county limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| You can see the existing land use surrounding the property tends to be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| So there's the rural residential land use, single-family residential, and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| And the sector plan has this parcel, part of it anyway, and then a smaller parcel across the street as neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| But the surrounding area is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| In terms of zoning, this property is CA, and again, another slivered or smaller parcel across the way is so in CA, but the rest of the surrounding property is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:47| And just to kind of give you a little bit of history of the project, or sorry, the request, this property has been run as a trailer repair service for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:57| These are aerial views dating a little bit back. You can see that it was a fairly orderly business, not a lot of clutter or anything like that up to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:08| However, in 2020, they either expanded operations or started doing something differently in how they were operating their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| And so a lot of the parts and things like that were scattered around the site, and it became more of a salvage yard at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| And so the county received numerous complaints and went out to the parcel and told the operator that he would have to cease that part of his operations or rezone the property to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:35| And that's the reason behind this rezoning is that the owner would like to continue these operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| We're recommending denial of this request. He's looking to go to heavy industrial land use and industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:50| But we just feel like given the low density of the area, that's not really compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| And then looking into KGIS, there's a sliver of industrial right here, but most of it occurs down in the mascot mine area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1736)|
| 0:29:05| And then down here close to Chilhowee, Asheville Highway, Rutledge Pike area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| And so we don't really want to start another industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| So in terms of the land use designation or the sector plan amendment, the site doesn't meet the location criteria for industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| It's not an existing industrial area. It's surrounded by residential low density, so it's not really compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| And so that's why we're recommending denial of the sector plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| And at this time, I'll see if you guys have any questions about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| I have a question. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| If this is denied, we're just denying what he has developed his business into, not his original truck repair or whatever it was originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:30:04| He could go back to the same business he was in two years ago. Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Even though parts of the property are still an agricultural zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| Well, I mean, that is an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| But it's, you know, it's a business that's been in some time and the business operations, the building, the part of it is right along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| I can go into county zoning and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:56| You guys are seeing my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| This part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Okay, just wanted to make sure I hadn't just shared my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:14| I guess what I'm asking is what's his use on the agricultural portion ever legal so that it is now legal nonconforming or was it at that point illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:25| My understanding is that when he was spoken to by the county that they told him he would have to cease and desist the salvage yard portion of it, they're considering the new operations as a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:37| And so that's the part that he was told he would have to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| My understanding is that if the zoning falls through and he has to retain that CA zoning that the original operation was never in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:57| I'm just looking at the uses in here to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Hey, Michelle, Steve Elliott here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Can I interject here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| The business operated as a vehicle repair service in the CA zone and expanded on to the agriculture zone and we we have deemed that to be a auto salvage yard, which would only be allowed in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:22| And I think that would still require a use on review to even been industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| Is that correct Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| I believe so I can go back into the ordinance and double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| I don't know the uses of each zone off the top of my head so I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| So it sounds like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| If this is denied there will have to, we will have to see this again, so that they can continue business in some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| No, the vehicle repair is allowed in the CA zone so he would have to cease and desist the auto salvage in the ag portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:33:02| Vehicle repair allowed in the agricultural portion of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| It is not, and it was isolated on the CA zone and just recently expanded into the agriculture zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=1988)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Any other questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| So the next one, number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2010)|

| 0:33:34| This one Michelle sent out an email to you all earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| This one, this applicant is requested to withdraw their application so this one will be voted on at the meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| If there's no objections I'm going to go ahead and skip this one at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Okay, seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| So the next one is agenda item 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| This is also another industrial request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| 10A20RZ, 10A20PA, and 10A20SP for Hudson emulsion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| This applicant is requesting to rezone a property containing this emulsion manufacturing plant, which is a legal nonconforming use from light industrial to heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:13| So Michelle will review this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| Okay, so this one is a business that's been in existence since either the late 50s, early 60s, hard to pinpoint the exact time point, using historical aerial views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:28| It was previously zoned I-2 and it's been that since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| We rezoned that with the new zoning ordinance to IMU which is a fairly comparable zone to I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| Looking at the existing land uses, it's basically bordered by rights of way to the west and south telecommunications utilities to the north and then this is the area that's causing problems for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:52| Right here is the single family area across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| And so looking at the sector plan it's light industrial with traditional neighborhood across the street as well and again the rights of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| And then finally in looking at the zoning, we can see that this property is IMU as well as a good bit of Woodland Avenue, sort of a corridor of some IMU land uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2105)|
| 0:35:15| This is Central Avenue which is bordered by commercial on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| The property has IH to the north and then this neighborhood right here is a small lot, small houses, fairly dense neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| And finally, just for a context of the site, you can see what the business is currently operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| So it's an emulsion manufacturing facility and so they use large tanks as part of their processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| So this is a concrete pad where all of the tanks sit and then the trucks enter and exit the site from here and then traverse the site and this is a gravel drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2141)|
| 0:35:52| And looking at Street View, this is what it looks like, the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| And then the surrounding area land uses, that single family residential along here across the street and then just kind of a pictometry view to kind of show you a little bit of how those two sites relate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:36:12| And so we're recommending denial of this one as well. And the reason for that is just because in looking at that zoning, like I was saying earlier, there's that corridor of IMU land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2172)|
| 0:36:26| And so we want to be consistent with that and also aware of the fact that it's right across the street from these smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| The business, if the zoning were to not to be approved, if it were denied and the IMU zoning would be retained, the business would still be allowed to be in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:44| They just wouldn't be able to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| The reason that they're asking for this zoning is to make their business compliant with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| They want to be legal land use within their zones that if they do want to make changes, they can do so without having to come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| Right now they have a request, they would like to remove four tanks and replace them with two. We had originally thought that they were going to be expanding, so replacing with more tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:11| And so I think that's the genesis for this rezoning, rather than going to the BCA. So we're recommending denial, which would enable them to replace their tanks without needing a variance, it wouldn't be an expansion of their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:25| They would not have to cease or anything like that. It just wouldn't, they would not be able to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| So Michelle, would they not be able to expand or they would not be able to expand without coming to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| They would not be able to expand without going to the BCA. So for them, because their use would not be, it's not conforming to be allowed to continue for the zoning ordinance, but not allowed to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:53| So if they did want to do that, they'd have to get a variance from essentially from the Board of Zoning Appeals that will allow them to expand their operation. So it would not become before this board would have to go to the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:38:04| So it doesn't really prevent them from expanding, it just forces them to go to the BCA for approval of the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| Correct. And if they want to replace tanks like what they're currently proposing to take some larger tanks away and bring in some smaller ones that I think probably the technology as it grows and gets better and these things become more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:24| they will be able to replace like for like or that sort of thing without having to get that BCA approval because it would be not considered an expansion. It's only if they would expand that you have to go to the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2304)|
| 0:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| Is that considered to be a use variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| No, it's considered an expansion of operations. So they're not getting a variance to allow a certain use. They're just allowing an expansion of an existing operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| The BCA can't give use variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| They're only allowed to deal with land issues specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:10| Any other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Okay, so the next one is agenda item number 13. It's 10D20RZ, 10C20SB, Daniel D., and Kimberly O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:26| You all have received, I believe, quite a bit of correspondence about this. So this applicant is requesting a Resilient Plan Amendment from LDR&A to Neighborhood Commercial and CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:36| And this is also Michelle's case. I'll turn it over to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Okay, so this is at that intersection of Choteau and South North Shore Road. You can see that the site is surrounded by residential development for the most part except for a commercial node to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:52| So these parcels here are designated commercial. There's NC zoning and then the rest of it is LDR and single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2392)|
| 0:40:02| The CN zone expands up into, there's a small shopping center here at the gas station and some other little outbuildings along this area. That's part of the CN zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:14| So we're recommending denial of this one as well. And sort of for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| When this CN zoning was originally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| The development of this neighborhood here. So it's basically surrounded by agricultural. These buildings weren't adjacent to the CN zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:37| And so right now we have this parcel here, and it's a fairly small parcel, and it abuts a house. You can see the corner of the house right here is very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2437)|
| 0:40:48| And so some of the uses that are allowed in the CN zone are not necessarily compatible with the single family residential. In particular, the zoning ordinance calls out certain NAICS codes as being allowed within the CN zone and NAICS just means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:41:06| classification system. And particularly it calls out NAICS 621 and NAICS 532. 621 is ambulatory health care services and includes things like surgery and medical or surgical and emergency centers, ambulance centers and organ and blood banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:23| None of those would be appropriate at this location. And then 532 includes truck, utility trailer, RV leasing and leasing of commercial industrial machinery and equipment. And those would not be appropriate at this parcel either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:36| And granted, it's not the use that the applicant attends. I think everybody knows that it's a beer garden that's proposed to go here. But if you're supposed to look at all the uses that are allowed within the zone and development falls through and it's got that CN zoning, any of those things would be able to go in there by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:53| And so even looking at the rush knot, there's some potential adverse impacts, mainly due to the size of the site. So obviously the noise of the people coming and going, lots of voices and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:42:06| Dumpsters, typically we don't like those to be located along the right of way. They're towards the rear of the site, which would put it closer to the residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| So then, of course, you've got the dumpster noise of that in the mornings when the trash is being serviced and potential smells and issues like that. And so even looking at that use, which is much less intense than those other ones, it wouldn't be appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2533)|
| 0:42:29| And finally, looking at the plan amendment that they have, they're asking for that neighborhood commercial plan amendment zone. And the neighborhood commercial is really more supposed to be smaller sites, smaller nodes that have just a few services that service everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2549)|
| 0:42:44| It's not really intended to be something that becomes this one and then this one and this one, kind of forming a line down a road. It's supposed to be more contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:53| And so we didn't feel like it really met the intent of the location criteria, as well as there not being an error in the plan and no change of conditions that's recent enough to warrant a consideration of the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:43:07| So those are the reasons that we're recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| Does anybody have any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Did this not come up a couple of years ago as a doctor's office, or was there a rezoning attempt or a use on review attempt they were wanting to do as a doctor's office? Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:24| Yes, there's actually been several. So let's see, there were, starting in 2001, there's been, I think, three or four. So there was a case that went from, asked for rezoning, that was, so they basically asked for office neighborhood commercial, and I believe general commercial, in some form or another over the past 20 years since 2001, it dates back and each time it's been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:54| Okay, so the doctor's office was denied back when they were doing that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| I'm a little confused because I agree with being one acre and the access to the road is truly not appropriate for most forms of residential. I'm really surprised that that office was considered appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:20| Commissioner Adams, did you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I guess this is a what if question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| What would be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| I'm trying to understand how this parcel, if it's not appropriate for neighborhood commercial, and it's not appropriate for like an office, what does the community see as feasible there other than the grass strip that it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:53| I haven't really heard from enough community members to be able to speak to what they would like to see there. I think sometimes people just don't want the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:45:02| I feel like an office zone, an office space would be appropriate there. I think it was just the particular type of office that was being proposed at the time was what caused a lot of distress with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:17| But I feel like an office zone would be appropriate as a transition between the neighborhood commercial and the residential along here. But it would be like a smaller office with not a lot of cause for parking and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2717)|
| 0:45:30| Because this area, it's kind of hard to traverse because of the roundabout, you can't really have access, you know, immediately close to the roundabout. So it kind of forces it onto here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:40| So there's really not a whole lot of options. It's kind of a difficult site due to the area, its location at the intersection of those two, like a collector and archery hole, and it being so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:53| I think back when they were doing the office, there was an allegation of a pain clinic that was going there, and the neighbors got a hold of that and really went wild with the concept of a pain clinic going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:46:05| I don't know if it was going to be or not. But now, my other question was, was this part of the neighborhood, was this parcel part of the subdivision Choteau Mill when it was originally developed, and was that part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:19| I have heard that it is. I haven't actually pulled any of the information, but typically what happens, even if you did have a subdivision that was plotted, there wouldn't be anything contained within that that we would look at that would prevent them from rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:39| So any sort of deed restrictions or anything like that that they would have would be a civil issue between the owner of this parcel, the developer of this parcel, and the HOA for these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:53| Commissioner Graf, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Yes, I was wondering, what is the definition of a beer garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| What are we talking about? I know what we're talking about. I want to hear what you say we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:15| Yeah, it's a smaller facility. They serve, I think, mostly craft beers and just maybe finger snacks. So I don't think they're going to have a full-fledged kitchen that they would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:28| They do have typically some sort of outdoor amenities so that you can kind of sit outside. And sometimes there's like sand pits and corn hole and stuff like that. So it's a little bit more, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:43| Do you have to have, is it because you have fewer food sales, like 50% food sales or something like that? Is that what defines a restaurant from a bar or tavern or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2863)|
| 0:48:07| Yeah, that's a good question because, you know, I did have a question like that when I first started in looking at this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:16| And Steve, I know you kind of weighed on this as well and looked at the use of a restaurant versus a bar and determined that we could in fact count it as a restaurant because it did serve some types of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:29| I don't think it goes into the detail of what types of food it needs to be or what percentage of sales. But please correct me if I'm wrong, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| Yes, for sure. The NAICS system that was used for the neighborhood commercial, I did speak with our law department and under the restaurants, they listed the code 722, which is the category for, I think it is called food services and drinking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:56| If you Google that and look it up, you'll find that underneath that, it lists like drinking places that serve alcoholic beverages and their primary business is alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:49:07| I also went and looked up the state liquor licensing and it says there that I think if more than 50% of your sales are alcohol, you're considered a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you, Steve. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| What kind of buffer is being proposed along the adjoining neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| I don't know yet. We did meet with the developers. They did have a conceptual site plan, but it's just conceptual at this point. We don't really have anything beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:39| I know you guys have seen some emails and gone back and forth. There is an ordinance stipulation that you can't have a beer permit sold within 300 feet of a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:49| Without them getting some sort of relief from that, which I don't even know how they would get, I don't know that they would be able to get a beer permit to sell beer at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:58| Hey, Michelle, I think it actually says that you can issue one within 300 feet, but the property owners have the right to come in and oppose your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:10| My staff, I asked my staff and none of them have ever witnessed that happen. So we're not sure how that works. If one of the neighbors would come in and oppose the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:21| I have an access question. Given the frontage of the property on Choteau and the two intersections, the roundabout and Choteau Mill Lane, is it even possible to put in a commercial driveway within the restricted area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3021)|
| 0:50:36| We can't deny it on the access of the site. So as long as they would meet, you know, Knoxville Avenue, they would be able to access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| Is it even possible to put in a commercial driveway within the restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:59| We can't deny it on the access of the site. So as long as they would meet, you know, Knox County's regulations in terms of how far they needed to be from an intersection, they would be able to put it right along in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:14| I think Aaron Fritz is on. He can maybe answer that question, but I think access would be difficult for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| Yes, Commissioner. Just like Michelle said, we can't deny them any access, but we would be looking to push their access as far away from that roundabout as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:33| Our access control policy stipulates that a commercial driveway can't actually encroach on that property line, so they would have to be off that property line at a minimum of five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:45| So we would encourage them to push it as far away as we could, but we couldn't deny them access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| You know, I know there's lots of negatives about this site, but gosh, the other commercial development where I think the Mexican place is and the pizza place, I mean, that's really been, it's been wildly successful over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:52:12| You've got all those people coming off the lake. I mean, gosh, it just seems like a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| Commissioner Browning, I agree with you. You know, when you think about what some other facilities that have the beer garden title have done for the areas, like, you know, there are several in South Knoxville and in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:42| It's a gathering place. Like, it's a friendly gathering place. It's not an icky bar kind of, you know, seedy sort of environment. It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| And I think I was excited to see the place being used in that sense of a gathering space, especially because of the work across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3170)|
| 0:53:03| It just seems like there's some synergy happening there right now. And I appreciate Commissioner Smith bringing up that it's been denied in the past for other uses. It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3183)|
| 0:53:15| I would caution the commission that we need to look at the zoning and not the proposed use. Uses change over time. And what may be a fun project now in five, 10 years, it may be entirely something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:31| I think we need to focus on the rezoning and not a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| Hey, Pat, isn't Neighborhood Commercial and NCN both, don't they require use on review for any proposed uses in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:50| I would let staff answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| It depends on the use. It's not all of the uses within NCN that are used on review, but there are some. Here's the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:54:05| So these top ones are the ones that are allowed by right, meaning they would not have to come before you. This list, just looking through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| And then kind of, you know, there's the main headers if that makes it a little bit more readable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:22| And then the ones that are permitted as use on reviews that would have to come before you, child daycare, adult daycare, restaurants, this one would, fueling service stations, drive through facilities, outdoor storage, self storage, and vehicle repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:42| If it was zoned and the beer garden did want to come in, it would require use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| I know it would be well received in the area, but I certainly understand the point of we need to focus on the zoning rather than the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3295)|
| 0:55:12| Any more questions? Going to move on to the next one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| So none of them are easy this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| So agenda item number 21 is 10L20RZ, 10B20PA, and 10B20SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| Benjamin Mullins, this was submitted on behalf of Hillwood Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| You all have received a few emails about this, not too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| And as you can imagine, this one was quite challenging for us to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| It's unique in several ways, which make the consideration of the request challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| It comprises over 75 acres, hundreds of thousands of vacant building square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| It's a flat, oddly shaped parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| And we rarely consider sites for rezoning of this size in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| So it's regionally significant due to its size, its location, the prominence of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| And so based on all of these factors, and combined with the decline of the mall over the last decade, which I'm sure you all are aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| and the final closure of the mall last winter, a significant change in conditions has occurred and continues to occur in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| So as you all know, this is an area that we have a lot of concerns about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| And we are especially aware of the importance to weigh carefully any changes when they involve rezonings to more intense zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| such as industrial, which we've already discussed a couple of those cases today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| So I'm going to turn it over to Michelle, who's going to review the staff findings in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| And I'm sure you all have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| So I won't spend too much time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I'm going to turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| So I'm going to review the staff findings in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| And I'm sure you all have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| So I won't spend too much time talking about the site, because I think everybody knows exactly where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| But I do kind of want to touch base a little bit on the surrounding existing land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| It's quite a broad mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| You've got multifamily and the rural residential and single family along through here, some agricultural forestry vacant, and then lots of commercial along through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:10| And then, of course, the right away to the south and sector plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| It's currently designated as the mixed use regional commercial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| And surrounded again by a pretty broad mix of general commercial MDR and some other commercial over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3442)|
| 0:57:31| So if you're looking at the zoning, the area is, for the most part, CR2 along Millertown Pike and North Mall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| And then it's not until you get into this area back here behind the mall that you get into some RN1 and RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| And then agricultural, some RN4 along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| And then, I can't see what that is behind you guys, RN3 on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| So looking, we've had a lot of questions come up as to what about if it was IMU, what about if it was IRD instead of the industrial general designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3480)|
| 0:58:14| And so I've got this comparison up here just so you can kind of see what the differences are between the zones in terms of the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3494)|
| 0:58:23| And so, basically, if you're looking at building height, for example, the general industrial zone is 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:32| That's the cap. And IRD, it's 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| However, once you get over 50 feet, you have that setback rule for one foot for every two feet of height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| And then setbacks are pretty similar in terms of the general industrial and the heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3523)|
| 0:58:54| And then, you know, so you don't, there's not really a whole lot of difference, I guess, is what I'm trying to say, other than the building height between the four zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| However, the IMU also has some building design requirements and some site design requirements, but they're pretty minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| So the IMU does offer some protections in the way of what the building would look like and what the site design would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| But again, it's pretty minimal. It just kind of talks about the fenestration, how, you know, how much transparency there needs to be, no blank walls, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3555)|
| 0:59:27| And then, you know, in terms of the commercial site design, surface parking can't be located between the principal building and the front lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| It's got to be located to the rear. Sites must be designed to ensure safe pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| And so, you know, answering the question of the IMU, I would say that surface parking, if it can't be located between the principal building and the front line, that might push the parking more towards the residential side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3578)|
| 0:59:50| And that could also impact the access and where the trucks are traveling. So I would probably have a little bit of caution with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3590)|
| 0:59:59| The other thing I wanted to kind of look at is in comparing the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| So here is the use matrix. And these are all the industrial zones and these are all the uses. And I've highlighted the ones that would be maybe more, I don't want to say more controversial, but less desirable, I would say, on a particular site close to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:24| When you're looking at the four zones, there's not a whole lot of difference between the lesser, less intense uses that are highlighted. And so IMU does allow a lot more lesser or less intense uses than the other zones do, as you can see through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3624)|
| 1:00:40| But once it gets into some of these other uses, then they start to become a little bit more similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3640)|
| 1:00:48| And in looking at the industrial uses specifically, this is kind of how they stack up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| And, you know, so in this particular use, the warehouse distribution center, and looking at that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3654)|
| 1:01:05| Okay, so that's allowed in all of them, but then you've got storage yards that are allowed in some of these and not in the lesser. And that's basically the main difference right there is the self storage facilities and the storage yards between the industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:21| Once you broaden that out and compare it to all the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:30| Trying to figure out where to move my panel screen so that I can actually see what's going on on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| Okay, so some of the uses that we're talking about the storage yards and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| Those are also allowed in the current zone where they're located, the CR zone, and so the P represents what would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:52| So stuff storage, while they're also allowed in industrial they're currently allowed where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| So it doesn't really offer any additional protections as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| Looking up in here, obviously the industrial zones, the industrial uses would not be part of that in the CR. The craftwood and the design would, but not the general or the heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3725)|
| 1:02:16| So that's basically what you're looking at. So it kind of becomes a question of not necessarily which industrial zone, but either denying the industrial and retaining that CR or approving the industrial and letting it go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:30| That's how we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| So I'm sure y'all have lots of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Well, the zone that's being proposed is it have no review, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| That's correct. It would go to the city, so it'd have to meet all the zoning ordinance regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| So there are like the landscaping buffer that's required between a non-residential use and residential use could come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:57| Those kinds of things, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| I mean, but we don't know for sure what you have an idea what they want to do, but you don't know for sure what they want to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| Yeah, I mean, they shared a site plan with us. It's conceptual, but because there's nothing that would, you know, they could always change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3787)|
| 1:03:16| There's nothing holding it to being done the way that they would show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| I don't know that it's really, it's relevant, but not necessarily because, again, you're having to consider all of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| What is staff's recommendation, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| Oh, I'm sorry. That would be important to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| We are recommending approval, and it's mainly for the reasons that Amy was talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| Just due to the size of the site, it's 78 acres, it's over 600,000 square feet of vacant building space that is already in the process of becoming blighted and would only do further decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:57| And so our concern is that, you know, this property has been in decline for over a decade, with the final nail in the coffin being that it closed its doors just this past May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:07| I think it was in May, earlier this year. And so, you know, that's only going to deteriorate further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| And so, you know, if we wanted to wait for what would be allowed in the CR zone, there's no telling how long that would take or what that would end up looking like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:22| And the property would be in further decline with blight associated with that, which would have a negative impact on the property and the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| So the worst case scenario is this could just be a big self-storage development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3872)|
| 1:04:40| Yeah, in terms of the uses, it could be that now. The self-storage is allowed in the CR zone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| Oh, it is? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Yeah, it is. So this is the CR zone down here, just kind of scrolling through. Let's get down to some of those yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:57| So craft industrial uses would be allowed now, and industrial design uses would be allowed now, but not the general or the heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| And so then once you come across to the industrial zones, this is that craft design or the industrial design, this is that craft, and this is the general and the heavy industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3904)|
| 1:05:16| So the IG does not allow industrial heavy, but it does allow the craft, the general, and the industrial design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3916)|
| 1:05:28| Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Yes. Michelle, I hear the term blight being used. Sometimes we mix up vacant with blight. Are we sure this property is blighted and how would you all define blight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:46| I don't think that it is now. I think it's in the process of becoming that, and to me, that just means that the property starts to fall into disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| You know, the surrounding landscaping isn't taken care of so that you've got, you know, weeds and things kind of growing everywhere, which can attract things like rats and stuff like that, vermin, to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:06:07| I know in lots of cases, there are some instances where, you know, people can tend to congregate in and around those sites where you can't really see into them and have some sort of nefarious activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:19| Those are the kinds of things that we wouldn't want to see happen on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| I have a question about the concern I have is the property that is around it that is currently used for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:39| I believe we received a helpful message from Commissioner Ryder, or Councilwoman Ryder, kind of detailing some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:51| But as I understand it, there's nothing that, at this stage of the game, there's nothing that we can really do to protect or make sure that those are going to be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4011)|
| 1:07:01| That would have to come into play if this was approved and then down the road through additional reviews? Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| Yes, that's correct. So the city doesn't allow conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| So the suggestions that were placed in the staff report were just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| They're just recommendations if this project or any project was to go forward in terms of considering the multifamily residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4038)|
| 1:07:28| You know, during the plan review stage, once it gets to the city's plan reviews and engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| they have the zoning ordinance and they have requirements for a lighting plan and other things that can be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| But no, at this time, we cannot condition the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| Michelle, did you have something to add? No, that's basically what I was going to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| I just think that in general, it is a large piece of property, but I hate to be pressured into giving somebody no review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| I mean, it could be. I think this property has real potential and it sounds like it could be repurposed well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| But I think we ought to, you know, make sure that it's done nicely because it I don't know that just I'm not saying I've made up my mind one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:15| but it concerns me to have no review on a property of this size because we're afraid of the weeds getting out of hand or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4095)|
| 1:08:25| I mean, I think that we have regulations with codes that they can be enforced to keep this place in shape until a good tenant's found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4105)|
| 1:08:34| I don't want to screw anybody's deal up, but I think that an opportunity to have this thing redone in a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4114)|
| 1:08:43| Commissioner Phillips. Yeah, thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Was there any consideration given to discussing the plan development requirements, which I think helps protect the surrounding businesses as well as the residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:09:02| You know, I do have a little concern that this is if this were a greenfield site and you didn't have development pretty much all the way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4142)|
| 1:09:16| Now that that's another issue. But, you know, this comes after the fact. This is a developed piece of property and now we're changing the entire use of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4156)|
| 1:09:29| And I think that allowing the Planning Commission and City Council to review what actually goes in and have some control over it, I think, would help make everybody a little more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:44| And that's a great question, Commissioner Phillips. It was suggested early on in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| So the plan development process is one that a plan is required upon approval. It's an overlay. It's not a change to the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| But it is a process that has to be initiated by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| It's not, you know, we can make recommendations, but they really have to initiate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| It is much more involved, but does provide you with that additional level review and discussion of tradeoffs in terms of, you know, community benefit and what they'd be willing to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4207)|
| 1:10:21| But that would be a good question for the applicant on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| So, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Yes, thank you. So I'd like to just briefly read a little bit from the East City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:37| Under the East Town Center Mall area historic context. It says Knoxville Center formerly East Town Mall located in Knoxville, Tennessee is a super regional shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4237)|
| 1:10:50| The mall opened in 1984 is located at Exit 8. The area lacks visibility from the interstate due to overgrown vegetation and the interstate right of way lacks science from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:11:01| In addition, the roadway circulation pattern around the mall area is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| Recommended uses a mix of uses should be allowed within this area including residential office institutional and commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| When redevelopment occurs, the current zoning should be replaced with design oriented zoning such as a form based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| The concept is allow is to allow mixed use building forms that are more urban and incorporate multiple modes of transportation plan commercial or residential zones could also be considered land uses should be consistent with medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:35| office and general commercial. There's an opportunity to include this area and future redevelopment scenarios including the mall, including parcel consolidation and creating a regional center possibly a town center concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4295)|
| 1:11:49| Further on in the sector plan under transportation considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| It says to pursue Washington Pike Millertown Pike and Broadway I 640 interchange improvements under the five year and 15 year plan responsible agency would be T dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4315)|
| 1:12:07| So with all that being said, I know that you know the mall closed less than a year ago. I don't know that a year of, you know, vacancy is enough to say that light has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:19| I think this is a large parcel of land, and no we don't want it to fall into disrepair but whatever happens on this property has a huge impact on what the city center looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4339)|
| 1:12:34| So I think that it requires a little bit more thought whoever tries to develop it. And I think that part of who chooses to develop it and what they choose to do has a large part on what the city does with I 640, and with Washington going into that area, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:54| if it continues to be confusing to enter, then there's not a lot of good opportunities for developers to do something with it. So, I would hope that that's something that is on the horizon for T dot, or the city to consider redeveloping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4374)|
| 1:13:11| I just want to be maybe clarify that, you know, it's not within our purview to determine that this property is blighted, I think that we said that it has the potential to be invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:20| So I just want to be really clear about, about what you know where staff is coming from. When making that that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:31| Commissioner Hill. Did you have a question. Yes, thank you. And I hear and those are good comments you made Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:40| It's funny I hear about this access and visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| But then I look at that area and I see Sam's is doing extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Walmart is doing extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| Many of the restaurants around there are doing extremely well and grocery stores are popping up over there and seem to be doing extremely well so when I see access and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:14:07| I don't think the mall is necessarily a visibility issue I think it's a concept issue. And while I haven't made up my mind yet I am really one I think if the community overwhelmingly wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4447)|
| 1:14:22| Then I think they probably deserve it just like as you guys go and review sector plans ever so often you get the community input so if they overwhelmingly want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:34| We probably ought to consider that. But going back to the root of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| I think, as we consider all the possible uses in industrial, you know, my guess is the reason they want to do, they choose not to do a plan development is if they ever left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:53| Then there would be a big question mark as to how those buildings could be repurposed. And so it, it puts a big question mark to the use as they if they ever moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4493)|
| 1:15:08| So, this is a this is a tough issue but again, I think we've got a concept issue here more than sight and visibility and access. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4508)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you, Commissioner Corbett says her hand raising is not working. Did you sell some questions, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| Yeah, I just wanted to, I had two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| One is I just wanted to confirm that there is no available zone that would allow the distribution center and require a review by the planning commission is that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4532)|
| 1:15:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| And then I was just I haven't had a chance to get to the staff report yet. What are the plans that T dot has to improve that on off ramp, because I've seen the track back up into the interstate shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4549)|
| 1:16:04| And with traffic I'm sure that will be compounded. When does T plan to improve that off ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:13| See if I if we can call on someone from city engineering. Let me scroll to my screen and see if someone's available to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| They may or may not be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| Instructor cannon available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| This is something you can answer or not but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I don't know the exact timeline commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| I know that T has had plans been actively doing the design for improvements at that interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:52| I wish I had better information and Amy with your permission. Let me track that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| And I will get an email to you. We're also evaluating Washington Pike within the city itself right now to determine the scope of those improvements and begin to push that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4618)|
| 1:17:12| Relatively soon that one's been dragging for a while I think back to 2015 that is coming back to the front burner, but I will get you more information on the interchange itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4632)|
| 1:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Any other comments or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| Seeing none, we'll move on to the next agenda item. Oh, I didn't have one more comment. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| I just wanted to point out that the evaluation of the roadway circulation pattern I mean I'm reading that directly from the sector plan for the city, and the recommended uses nowhere does it say that industrial is something that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:57| wants in that section of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| 2014 sector plan so it's about seven years old, not super duper old maybe it requires some more evaluation or an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4681)|
| 1:18:10| I understand that the mall closing is a significant change for sure and could, you know, shift how that part of town is used but I don't know how beneficial a distribution center would be to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| Okay, let's move on to the next one so number eight is nine a 20 RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| The applicant is requesting a rezoning from PR to a and Liz Albertson is the planner who will review this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you. I mean, can you all hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Yes. Okay, great. I'm going to share my screen with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4733)|
| 1:19:04| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| I cannot hear myself talk. I wish there was a way I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4748)|
| 1:19:17| Okay, can you see the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Um, so this is the area. This is agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| This is off of ball road in the northwest county sector of a small dead end road called Zion Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4769)|
| 1:19:39| This parcel is highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| There is an existing sort of church like building that is in the rear portion of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4781)|
| 1:19:51| And the applicant is currently zoned as planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| They are asking to go back to agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| It had been rezoned I believe in 2016 to planned residential. So they are asking to go back to the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4802)|
| 1:20:12| This parcel is low density residential and our sector plan, as does the surrounding agricultural zone area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4812)|
| 1:20:20| The existing land uses include a mobile home park in this large parcel that you see kind of adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| And this site used to be actually a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Elder care. And so that's why it shows up as multifamily at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4835)|
| 1:20:45| Again, they're asking to rezone to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| And this is just generally the description of agricultural zone district provides for a wide range of agricultural and related uses, as well as residential uses with low population densities and other compatible uses, which generally require large areas or open spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4849)|
| 1:21:06| And I know we've received several comments about this one because of the, you know, perhaps applicants intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4866)|
| 1:21:15| But again, I just want to remind everyone we're considering the zone district, not a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| So they're applying for agricultural. Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| How does the proposed use fit in under the agriculture under low population density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| Well, so in the applicants application, they have not said what they intend to use the property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4896)|
| 1:21:45| But, you know, we have received an application for next month for a use on review for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4905)|
| 1:21:55| And that, you know, use the applicant worked with Steve Elliott, I believe on this as well as our previous director, Gerald green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4915)|
| 1:22:04| And it was noted that the type of use that they're proposing would most likely fall into the lodging and boarding houses use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:13| And that is a use permitted on review in the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| It's a use permitted in CA and CB, both commercial zone districts in the county, but it's a use permitted on review and agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4939)|
| 1:22:30| And then just another real quick question was, what about the remaining building to the rear. I don't even see how it has independent access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4950)|
| 1:22:41| So let me try to bring my other screen up and zoom into this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4961)|
| 1:22:55| I think it's just a warehouse back there like a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| And I think also it is not it's on a separate parcel from this one. So that is not part of the application for a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4980)|
| 1:23:10| So that's my point is, it's a separate independent parcel, I don't see have access except to go through this, because the road the dirt road behind it climbs quite steeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=4990)|
| 1:23:31| So, um, this is Zion lane. This is where the end of the right of way of Zion lane is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| And this parcel currently has access off of this Zion lane at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| I, you know, it appears that there is a access running all the way back to this parcel back here. So I assume this parcel is getting access this way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5027)|
| 1:23:59| Do you see that access which way where I see internal access I see the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| This is where Zion lane ends. Um, so, uh, this, you know, is kind of like a flag light here so it looks like they're using this as an access at the end of Zion lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5046)|
| 1:24:24| It seems from the aerial that they're accessing the pavement within the proposed site, unless the building has a garage door right on that dirt road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5064)|
| 1:24:40| Just as you turn it, the dirt road is above or equal to the ridge line of that house or building. So I'm just wondering if they're separated, how that's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5080)|
| 1:24:54| I'm just, I know you don't have the answer it's just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| Possibly was owned on the same parcel and probably has an easement or something but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5099)|
| 1:25:11| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| I'm curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| I know we're, we're only talking about the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| And there's so many different types of uses available under agriculture. Is there any other zone that might also work for for what's being potentially intended that might lessen the issue for neighbors if it doesn't work if they change since we're changing the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5124)|
| 1:25:51| It's my understanding that this use, and Steve Elliott's on the call still if he could chime in that this use has been determined to be in line with the boarding house use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5151)|
| 1:26:04| So, um, you know, as far as I know, this is the use that they have been aligned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5164)|
| 1:26:31| Since the county zoning ordinance is fairly old and these types of uses aren't really called out explicitly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| Steve, do you have anything you'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Actually it's a church it's purchasing it I think it's angelic ministries that and they're going to home, they're going to house. I think 12 individuals that have maybe been homeless at one point and they're going to teach them life skills in the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5204)|
| 1:26:58| Yeah, I will say that's a another good important point to make too is that it has been determined that as a boarding house, they would be limited to 12 individuals that have been homeless at one point and they're going to home, they're going to house. I think 12 individuals that have been homeless at one point and they're going to teach them life skills in the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5218)|
| 1:27:19| Yeah, I will say that's a another good important point to make too is that it has been determined that as a boarding house, they would be limited to 12 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5239)|
| 1:27:31| The only problem is, though, the ag zone is surrounds this place. You really can't look at, I don't know, it seems you have to look at the zoning and if it's appropriate. Is that an appropriate zone for that property given, given its location. And it seems like it should be to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5251)|
| 1:27:50| I think you're correct, Scott. We, you know, my office has deemed it to be an appropriate use for the zone. I guess the location is the question. And we would leave that up to the board to decide if it's an appropriate location or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5270)|
| 1:28:03| I just want to point out, just so the commission remembers that I believe event is permitted in agricultural zone. So it's possible alternative use might be an event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5283)|
| 1:28:19| In the agricultural zone, the rural retreat is use permitted on review that would allow an event center type use, but the minimum acreage for that, I believe is 10 acres. And then if they were going to have people stay overnight, the minimum would be 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5299)|
| 1:28:45| No, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| Okay, I don't see any other hands raised. So the next item is number 14. It's Jenny 20 RC and this is Ben Mullins on behalf of Primo's land company. This is similar quest that was heard this spring and Liz Albertson will provide you an overview of the application and why you're seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5330)|
| 1:29:06| We toggle back to my other screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| So, yes, you may remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| We toggle back to my other screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5360)|
| 1:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| So yes, you may remember this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| It looks very similar to one that was on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| back in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| However, the applicant has come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| and they have added an additional two plus acre area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| along the frontage with West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| We described a little bit of sort of what's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| about this application in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| They are requesting the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| They would like to go from their existing agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| and also the CA zoning to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| They're asking for a density up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| Staff continues to recommend up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| dwelling units an acre, partially because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| the recommendation of the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| and then the densities of the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| There hasn't really been anything major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| that has changed out here, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| since we reviewed this in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| So our review is still very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| to what it was in May for this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| but we're including this recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| for the additional two acres added to this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| This is what the slope analysis looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| Again, this is West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| and this is Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| Are there any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| Is the property that's zoned CA right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| is that a separate lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| No, it's actually all one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| So when we advertised it the first time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| if you'll notice when you look at the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| for the case in May, it said part of a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| And so they were only requesting to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| the rear portion at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| that is currently zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| They weren't including the CA portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| but it's actually all one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| So now the application says all of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| And it went to County Commission and they sent it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| Yeah, they actually denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| Yeah, sorry, I think Director Brooks, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| Yeah, it was denied by County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| Can you tell me what aspect caused them to deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| Was it, was anything in particular or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| Let Commissioner or sorry, Director Brooks, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| There was a lot of concern from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| about access and congestion on roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| and particularly the access to Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| There was quite a few community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| that came and spoke about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| There was quite a few community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| that came and spoke about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Well, the neighborhood does not want connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| in the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| They want all the traffic to be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| So if it was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| is there a period of time they have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| or did somehow is the change from the CA to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| enough of a change to resubmit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Yeah, that's a good question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| I was gonna point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| So typically there's a year timeframe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| in which applicants have to wait to request after a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| But with the addition of the rest of the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| they can come back in with a similar request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| because it wasn't exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| It was with the addition of that front parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| So if this is recommended for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| it goes to the county, are they going to deny it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| I can't, I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5632)|
| 1:34:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Yes, there's a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Commissioner Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5648)|
| 1:34:08| So tell me a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| why we recommended four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| I was looking at the Hilltop Ridgetop Density Calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| and actually came up with five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| by our own calculations as recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| So how did we end up recommending four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| It's actually, I think it's 3.77 is the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| Let me double check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| I was just looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| I was looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| And unless I'm misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| the density calculation that's in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| Yeah, so it's the one above it that says 3.77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| So the applicant is proposing five dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| for a 23 acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| So what they are recommending would yield 118 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| We are recommending up to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| The slope analysis recommended up to 3.77 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| an acre, so that would have resulted in 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Okay, I'm not seeing that particular one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| So this is page seven of the PDF file for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5722)|
| 1:35:30| Let's see, I will try to toggle back over to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Yeah, Liz, if you can share it, that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| Okay, can you see my screen here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| This has page seven from the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| This is the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| So it's a 23.77 acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| So it's two acres larger than it had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| the last time this came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| because they're including the CA zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| 3.77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| So we're just placing it on the actual slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| for the density, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| So that's part of it, that's not the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| We're also looking at the adjacent zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| So, you know, if you look in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| there are a number of planned residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| that are zoned up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| and up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Gotcha, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| What is that area, the small frontage section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| that is currently zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Does anyone know what that is used for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| Because it's not, is it a truly commercial usage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| No, it's currently a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| How did it get zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| You know, we have lots of commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| around the county in places that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| sort of predate kind of our record keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| that Alex, you know, demonstrated that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| So this one, you know, doesn't show up on our map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| to let us know when it was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| So it was likely something that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| anywhere from the 1950s to the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| And then the parcel right beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| your curse, yeah, bingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| That one, the same thing, it's really a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| but it's in a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Mr. Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| So my interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| it could only be an interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| is that I remember there were comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| about Blacksburg Road being a blind curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| or being on the blind curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| and traffic backing up on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| So I think that a lot of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| in the surrounding area were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| with the traffic impact that would have and accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| So I believe that they purchased this additional parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| on what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| East Emory Road, West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| as potentially, there's no way of knowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| as potentially another outlet for that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| so that people are not all building up on Blacksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| So just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| Because of Commissioner Dent commenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| about the community response last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| just to double check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| this has come up so quickly again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| that the community has been alerted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| They have been notified that this is returning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| Yes, the same process that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| for the application in May occurred for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| Postcards went out, an ad was ran in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| and sign was placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| And I believe we do have some people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| to speak in opposition of this for the Thursday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5960)|
| 1:39:28| What is the density of the subdivision to the left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| The RA zone subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| I'll have to toggle back, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| to the previous staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| but I believe it was around maybe 2 1⁄2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| dwelling units, Snaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| Okay, any other final comments or questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| Okay, seeing none, we'll move on to agenda item 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| This one is also Liz's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| It's 10I20RZ, Worley Builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Liz is going to discuss the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| and staff's recommendation for a lesser density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| than requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6015)|
| 1:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Yes, this is off of Low Betty Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| So this is actually not too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| from the Zion Lane area that we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| This is also not too far from Amherst Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| This is Ball Camp Pike and Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| Low Betty cuts through the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Low Betty is currently closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| I don't know if any of you have tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| to drive out there to see this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| but it's challenging to get back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| because they are developing the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| at this location here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| I think it's called Carrico Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| So it's challenging to get back here to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| It is a five-acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| It's a relatively shallow parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| They're asking for up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| Again, you can see it's larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| more estate-like housing over in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| This Chaud Road extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| is expected to come through here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| It's under construction, I believe, currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| So some of this rezoning that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| in recent history, I think, have occurred largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| because of knowing that Chaud Road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| would be coming through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| So again, they are asking to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| to planned residential five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| However, staff is recommending a lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| It's part of a mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| that's acknowledging the major improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| that are coming in through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| as well as desire for more residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| and commercial office uses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| So that's why you see this zoning pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| emerging out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Again, this side of Low Betty Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| is more estate-like agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| and ag forestry vacant currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| There are a couple of single-family houses out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| So because of that difference in sort of the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| of the east side of Low Betty Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| we are recommending up to two dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| rather than up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| And that's also because of sort of the type of lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| that's being proposed at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| or sorry, the lot size at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| And this tract that's being proposed for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| is approximately 200 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| And again, it's almost just five acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| So they could potentially accommodate 25 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| at this location if it were zoned up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| dwelling units an acre, which seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| that would be very challenging to fit that many homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| in here and also deal with consistent access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| So we're recommending up to two dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| rather than up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| I can't see hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Jeff Roth, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| No, I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| Okay, so let's, no questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| We'll move on to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| All right, agenda item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| It's a special use application for a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| two family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Applicant Ryan Rowe and Mike Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| will review this one with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Sharing my screen here with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| So just let me know if you're not seeing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| but so this project includes three duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| on Mars Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| Mars Hill, it's along North Gallagher View Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| if you're familiar with West Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| So West Hills neighborhood is to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| and then the Walmart and up to the I-40 near the mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| is down here to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| So the property, it does, the property does back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| to Gallagher View, but the access is off of Mars Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| So there won't be any access that crosses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| the capitation greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| I just wanted to mention this one or just bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| because it's not a very complicated case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| It is three duplexes we are reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| under the old planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| because the property was formerly zoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| And so because of the new transitional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| or transition rules within zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| that still applies because there was a former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| development plan for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Originally it was proposed for an assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| That plan has long since stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| But I wanted to just show you the site plan that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| And it's a little more basic than what we typically see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| You see that there's three duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| based on into Mars Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| They had to revise the way that the driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| will come in on lots two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| So there's this kind of green boxes here and here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| to show that access will be from the middle of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| to the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| A lot one will have two driveways and I'll show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| So this is what they were originally submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| The garages would be on either side of the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| on the outsides of the units and the main entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| would be in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| So lot one will still use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| And you can see here on their site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| it's in the architecturals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| that they have two driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Because of the lot width, lots two and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| are not wide enough to have two separate driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| So they'd either have to get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| through the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| or they would need to basically flip their floor plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| so the garages are in the middle of the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| and the entrances are on the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| That way they could have one driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| that comes in off the Mars Hill Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| and would service both garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| So I just wanted to, this is a little bit atypical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| to what we would normally see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| So I just wanted to make sure everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| was aware of what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| From a contextual standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| let me go back to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| Mars Hill Road, it's actually a decent road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| from a drivability standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| But there's not a whole lot of context out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| There's only a few existing houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| And there's not, you're not trying to like line up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| these new units and driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| with the existing context of houses along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| There's really nothing to compare it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| or trying to relate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| So from a contextual standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| there's really not, staff doesn't have too much concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| with what they're proposing and the driveway layouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| and the locations of the units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| And I'll be happy to answer your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6479)|
| 1:48:06| I don't see any comments or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Are there any other items that may have interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| to the commissioners that you'd like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Amy, I'm going to bring up one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| So the November meeting commission will be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| to consider an amendment to the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| that will allow for consents to be heard as a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| So what we've done always in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| is that at every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| we make a motion a second to hear consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| And then we actually vote on approving the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| Under this, we would essentially eliminate the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| to vote every meeting on hearing consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| that will be allowed in the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| So in the future, once after commission approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| after the November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| then all will be required is a vote to approve consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| as read and not eliminate the need to hear consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| Is that confusing to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| Amy, did I explain it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| I think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| We're not voting on it, but we're still voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| We're voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| The amendment to the bylaws at the November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| which will then allow in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| consent items to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| We don't need to vote on hearing consent at each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| We just vote on approving consent at each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| So what we do now, cause I'm still new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| It realized we did two motions for consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| one to entertain it and then one to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| we're just narrowing it down to one motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| Hearing two motions is relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| When I was on before and we had consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| it just took one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| So this is something that's come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| I don't know why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| but we didn't have it the other times I was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| I have a question about number 38, which is the Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| Is that one going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| is that anticipated that that's going to be on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| and then we won't be talking about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| Mike, do you want to speak to that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| I don't know that we haven't reviewed for consent yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| Do you have a particular concern or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| I do have a particular question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| I was thinking back about recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| when we updated the zoning codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| and I was thinking that we had some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| I haven't cross-referenced this yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| but I was thinking we had some language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| about invasive plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Looking at that updated plant list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| I think a couple of the plants that are on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| might be considered invasive in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| I was wondering if that has been double-checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| I haven't looked at that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| Typically that gets looked at in the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| So we can make them aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| but they should change up some of those plant things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| But yeah, that's typically looked at in the permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| But yes, Commissioner Easton, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| I don't know off the top of my head where exactly that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| I'd have to look, but we do reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| the city's maintained list of appropriate plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| in the code that is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6717)|
| 1:52:05| So we'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Enjoy your Tuesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201006-agenda-review?start=6742)|
