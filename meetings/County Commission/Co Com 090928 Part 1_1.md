| 2:30:59| before she passed away at age 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9059)|

| 2:32:35| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| authorizing the presence of pet dogs in outdoor dining areas of restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9158)|

| 2:32:50| 6-1 to approve with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9170)|
| 2:32:57| What is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| I'll let Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| I'm not sure about the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| It was added intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| But the purpose of this was the state of Tennessee passed the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| which would give restaurants the opportunity to have things like a yappy hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| or to bring dogs in outdoor facilities if they chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| But the local governments would have to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| So I put this on the agenda to give restaurants the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| They're not forced to do it if they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| If they want to, this gives them the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| And there are very strict regulations that they have to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| should they decide to allow these dogs on these outdoor patio areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| There was also a slight fee if they wanted to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| I think we put up to $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| They don't have to charge anything if they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| But if they want to charge something, it could be up to $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| So that's the background behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| I believe that was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| So it would be up to $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9236)|
| 2:34:01| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| I already made a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| I didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| There was no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| Then I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| With the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| You know, and, again, as I spoke about last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| my only concern with this resolution as written is that there's no limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| I mean, it's nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| It would be great to have a yappy hour or things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| But what this would do would allow dogs in, any type of dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9285)|
| 2:34:50| in any type of restaurant unless they, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| I don't know if there's an opt-out process for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| But, I mean, to be brutally honest, and I know pit bulls are nice, can be nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9297)|
| 2:35:03| but they can also be bred to be not so nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| And so I will use that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| And, you know, if there's a baby, if there's someone there having dinner, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:16| we could have a bad situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| So I just want to make sure that we're not just rubber stamping something that we're not fully thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| You know, I think this opens the door to have any type of dog in outdoor eating areas in a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:35| People, not everyone's a dog lover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| I personally like dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| I don't like large, you know, aggressive dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| But, you know, and I really don't want to have my meal sitting next to one having to keep an eye on my steak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:49| and the other eye on my dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| So I'm just asking us to consider, you know, maybe, I don't know, if we should delay this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9351)|
| 2:36:00| think about it, put some verbiage in there that would restrict that somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:08| Mr. McKenzie, you're scared that dog will get your steak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| No, it's not the steak I'm worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| They can have the steak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| Mike, you know, I'm not going to eat outside where a dog can eat, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| But my concern with the resolution is not codifying more a health department issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9384)|
| 2:36:31| You know, you've got the issue of waiters and waitresses being outside, going inside and outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| that may handle the dog and may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| We've got more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| I think a resolution doesn't cover it enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| I think we have to have the health department involved and have an ordinance instead of just a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| because I think there's a sanitation issue more than a wanting to eat with a dog issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| That's just my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| I understand the concerns expressed by my two colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| But the concerns have already been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| This is outside, not inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| We're not going to be letting dogs in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| This is an opt-in situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| This doesn't say that you have to allow dogs in restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| It says you may if you choose to, if the business owner chooses to allow dogs in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| And the business owner can control what kind of dogs they allow in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| Just like people, they can refuse to allow ornery dogs in their establishment if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:40| I think what this really comes down to, and, again, this is not going to affect my district very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| My district is predominantly suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| But this is going to affect urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| As we become a more walkable city, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| with greenways that are connecting restaurants and things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| you're going to have situations where people are going to choose to walk their dogs on the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| They're going to choose to stop and have a cup of coffee or have a beer on a patio while they're out walking their dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9485)|
| 2:38:13| And I think that the vision that we have for our city, that we want Knoxville to be a very walker-friendly and walkable city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9493)|
| 2:38:21| I think that part of that is allowing folks who are walking their dogs to stop and maybe have a snack or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9501)|
| 2:38:29| I don't see that there's any problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| And, in fact, I see that there's benefits with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| That's why I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| I guess my question is, it has to be outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| And must there be access to that outdoor area without coming inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:54| or can they parade their dogs through the restaurant to get to the outdoor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| They cannot come inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| They cannot come inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| So they must be able to access this area without coming inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| If I could, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| if you look at the language of the resolution, that is verbatim from the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| So I didn't get awful when I drafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| I melded into the resolution that which the state promulgated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| So the language you see is a mirror image of the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| And it reads, for instance, that the pet is not permitted in the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| The restaurant owner can preclude the entrance of the animal if it's not well behaved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| If people come in contact with it, that work there, they have to wash their hands, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| But, again, your resolution mirrors the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9578)|
| 2:39:39| That was just a question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:40| And, Sam, to answer your question about losing your state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| one time I went outside during dinner to where my neighbor's dog came into the yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:53| and knowing that they would want it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| I walked out through the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:56| I left the door open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| And before anybody could say or do a thing, that dog got up into my chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:05| and ate the biscuit off my plate before they could even stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| So that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| I'm not sure if I'm for this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| But, you know, I guess I believe in allowing private ownership to make those decisions on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:24| So I guess I'll probably be voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9628)|
| 2:40:29| I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| Didn't our mayor recently declare Knox County is the dog-friendliest county in the world or something along those lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| So we can stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| We don't need this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| Did you have something else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| Yeah, one quick point, and I'll keep it well under three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| Prior to Mr. Smith's resolution passing on liquor by the drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| a lot of times access to a liquor license was used as an excuse for annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:13| One thing I do think we need to be aware of is that pets are allowed on patios in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| The city of Knoxville has already spoken on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| So there's a possibility if you've got a nice restaurant that's along a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| that they may actually turn around and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| we'd like to be annexed so we can let our neighbors who are walking their dogs on our patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| Yet another reason to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| Mr. McKenzie, if a dog ever eats your steak, I'll gladly reimburse you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| And no dogs may buy by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| That's one of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| You know, I really don't wish to make too light of an issue out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9711)|
| 2:41:56| But there's two things that I want to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| Looking at the resolution that was taken straight from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| it says that the restaurant shall have the right to refuse to serve the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| So they have to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| So let's be crystal clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| If we pass this resolution as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| the person will have to take affirmative action to opt out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| as opposed to a restaurant saying that this doesn't apply unless you want it to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:35| And then the second part that I guess, again, just kind of disturbs me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| is that Particle or Section 7 says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| accidents involving pet dog waste shall be cleaned immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| and the area sanitized with an approved product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| A kit with appropriate materials for this purpose shall be kept near the designated outdoor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9774)|
| 2:43:00| It doesn't say who is to clean that waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| And I think some owners would think that since the kit will be owned by the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| that that would be something that the restaurant staff would have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| which I think is not the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| So it looks like I'm not going to win this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| But can I make two amendments to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| One to say that we add that the dog owner is the person who shall clean up the waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| And the second one is that we clarify this language to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| ask the law department to clarify this language to say that people will have to opt in to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:45| If the maker of the motion would accept those two fairly reasonable, I think, amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| I'm looking at our law director on the opt in, opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| I think that to require the dog owner, we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| but I think it's ultimately up to the restaurant owner to make sure that it is clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| and that if, indeed, that does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| So I think we could say the owner would be responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| but I think that the restaurant is ultimately going to be responsible for making sure that it's clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9848)|
| 2:44:13| and that the proper sanitation is done for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| That would be a big tip, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| Or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| Mr. Law Director, what about the opt in, opt out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| Well, again, this is a new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| It's untested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| So I think we have to be careful getting too inventive in terms of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| But, you know, in a nutshell, it does empower the restaurant the right to refuse service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:38| If a restaurateur permits dogs per se| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| and the one patron brings in an animal that's unruly or that appears to be dangerous or bothersome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9881)|
| 2:44:47| who can refuse to permit the animal on the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| I think it would be just a matter of the restaurateur posting a sign saying no dogs allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| if they didn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| Or if they do, they could say dogs allowed and you could do it certain days of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| certain hours of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| It gives them a lot of flexibility as to when they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| They don't have to do it every single day if they want to do it just like on Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| That's the way I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| that it gives the business owner a lot of flexibility as to when they do it, if they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:17| So I guess bottom line is I don't have a problem saying that the person is responsible for any waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:23| but I still think the restaurant is going to have to be ultimately responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| But the other thing is I think that the language is pretty clear if they want to opt in or opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9925)|
| 2:45:33| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| I was going to get to the same point Commissioner Hammond did was the waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| It ultimately is going to fall on the restaurant owner to make sure that his restaurant is sanitary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| And although the owner of the animal should feel obligated to clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9946)|
| 2:45:54| or at least assist in cleaning it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| I don't see how we can get the owner of the restaurant off the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9957)|
| 2:46:02| as to making sure that his restaurant is sanitary and meets all codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9962)|
| 2:46:09| So I'm not going to be in favor of that particular amendment to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:17| Did you add those amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| I'm just going to go ahead and leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| I think our law director has said that it's pretty clear from what the state has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| If I've got to watch somebody clean that up, that's going to sure spoil my dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| I'm here to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=9994)|
| 2:46:40| Ecclesiastes says there's a time and a place for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| And I don't believe the place for a dog is at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I'm sorry, folks, but that's the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| I don't even know why we're involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| I can't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10019)|
| 2:47:00| Here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10020)|
| 2:47:01| Now, I have dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| And, of course, this is supposed to be just up to the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| I don't think any of these restaurants are going to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| I'm a dog lover and I have dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| But when me and my wife are eating, our dogs are outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10030)|
| 2:47:14| You know, and I just don't ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| I don't even know why we bring this kind of thing before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| Well, we're bringing it because it's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| And restaurants have said that they would like the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| a few of them have said they want the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| If I don't want to eat at a restaurant that has dogs, I don't have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| I mean, I have that opportunity not to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| But, anyway, it is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| We have to do this to give the restaurants the opportunity to opt in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| And so that's why it's brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| And so it's up to us to vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Let's vote it up and vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:45| No amendments to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| Let the restaurants decide what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Has the health department weighed in on this at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| I haven't heard anybody say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10072)|
| 2:47:59| Has the health department weighed in on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Sam, I want to comment on some of yours real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:08| I love dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| I've got a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| You know, you talk about having a dog and having it on a greenway and bringing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| You know, some people get there and run a greenway or dogs, you know, run with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| I'm sorry, but when I'm eating dinner, I don't want a panting dog sitting there panting while I'm trying to eat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| and, like you say, worry about having to clean up another mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| I just think there's a big health issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| And Commissioner Hammond talked about, you know, going in or not opting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| You know, sometimes you're invited to dinner and you don't pick the place where you're having dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:41| And, Mr. Pinkston, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| I don't think we need to be talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| It's something that we don't need to be bringing before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| But I just think it's just unsanitary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| I don't want fleas jumping off the dog and onto somebody else's little baby sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| and they get fleas and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| I just think it's very unsanitary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10143)|
| 2:49:04| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| I don't see any other likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| I think we're probably going to have a roll call, but let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| Roll call starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| This is on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10170)|

| 2:50:50| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| 12 yes, 6 no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10252)|
| 2:51:04| On page 16, this is resolution 9-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| to prohibit handguns, county parks, natural areas, historic parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| natural trails, campgrounds, forests, greenways, waterways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| or other similar public places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| 6-0, to defer 30 days and schedule public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10300)|
| 2:51:45| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| I'm probably moving a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| I appreciate everyone who came out today to speak on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| but I think it would be best for all of us to defer it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10315)|
| 2:52:03| to make sure we have ample time for everyone to give their opinion on this at a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:13| Everyone expected to be able to debate this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| That's why they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| Commissioner Hyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| If that's the will of the Commission, then that's the will of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| I don't think that this is one of those issues where we've made up our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| I believe that most everyone knows how they're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| I'm prepared to vote on it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| And so rather than deferring it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| I would like to see us go ahead and vote it up or vote it down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| A substitute motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| I'll make that a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10366)|
| 2:52:50| This is on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| Yes, I just wanted to say that we do have some folks that are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| and I certainly want to hear from these folks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| In fact, Mr. Womp just came in, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| He'd like to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| But there's a lot of folks that aren't here today, and they're not here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10390)|
| 2:53:14| because I've told them that we would probably have a forum where they would be able to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10394)|
| 2:53:21| And so, you know, I'm certainly ready to vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| I don't think it takes a crystal ball to figure out how I'm going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| But I just wonder whether we should have the workshop to give some of these folks an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| I've had a workshop on my e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| I've never seen anything like before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| Except the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| Commissioner Hammond, your substitute motion is simply to go ahead and vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10436)|
| 2:54:01| It's not an up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| It's just that you want to go ahead and vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| Well, I'll clarify it, and I'll go ahead and make the motion that the commission of Knox County allow handguns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10449)|
| 2:54:15| in county parks, natural areas, historic parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| In other words, to allow permit holders the opportunity to carry their weapons in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| That will be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| I just wanted to make clear I didn't want to have to vote twice on something if we can vote once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10464)|
| 2:54:28| because if we were just going to decide to hear it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| then all you'd have to do is vote no on the original motion and then get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Thank you for your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10475)|
| 2:54:36| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| Doesn't it make more sense to either vote to deny the motion or accept the existing motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| When the existing motion is to opt out, and Commissioner Hammond can make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10485)|
| 2:54:51| I mean, that seems to make more sense than introducing a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| It's the same either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| Procedurally, it just makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| We don't want to make any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| And actually, that's not the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| The motion on the floor is a motion to defer, and Mr. Hammond's motion is no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10504)|
| 2:55:10| It's a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| No, I meant before the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| So it's not like we're taking one motion and flipping it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| What we're doing is instead of deferring it, we're going ahead and hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| I just wanted to echo Commissioner Hammond's thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| I feel like that everybody came with their minds made up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| and I don't think 30 days is going to change anybody's mind between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10536)|
| 2:55:41| In fact, I just think it will cause a whole lot more disturbance in the community than letting it go 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| We just need to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| The city has, and now it's up to the county commission to make their decision on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| So I'll go along with what Commissioner Hammond suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10555)|
| 2:55:59| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| Yeah, I just want to make sure I'm clear on this, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| Your motion is that we vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| Yeah, my motion is that we vote to allow permit holders to carry their handguns in county parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:16| natural areas, and what the resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| I'd just like to remind all of us sitting up here that we were elected to represent the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:32| and the people's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| I think you've seen from the e-mails that we've all gotten in the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10594)|
| 2:56:39| plus I'm sure that some of you did like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| I sent my own survey out to people in my district to see what their feelings were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:50| not just so I would have feelings from coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| and thank you all that sent those to put in your zip codes on so we know what areas are represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10614)|
| 2:57:00| But I sent a survey out in our own district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| and I had one out of 30 that would have been opposite this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10624)|
| 2:57:13| So I'm here to vote for the wishes of the people in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10633)|
| 2:57:20| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10642)|
| 2:57:23| Mr. Law Director, if this item wasn't even on the agenda today and we did nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:31| the state law would allow the use of the handguns to carry the handguns into the parks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10651)|
| 2:57:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| The way the law reads is that the legislature changed the law permitting those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| who have permit carries to possess handguns in nature trails, parks, campgrounds, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10666)|
| 2:57:54| If you did nothing, the law would stand and permit holders would be permitted to so do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10674)|
| 2:57:59| If you opt out affirmatively, then you would preclude that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:05| So is the motion that we have before us, actually the substitute motion we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:13| is it still proper to vote that we're voting in the affirmative of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| or is it that you really need to be voting to vote out of the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:22| Well, if you want to change the current state of the law, which as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| you're permitted to carry handguns in parks with a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| then you would affirmatively vote to opt out and thereby prevent that right to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10710)|
| 2:58:36| So essentially, in terms of just specifics and articulating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10716)|
| 2:58:44| basically your motion would be to not take any affirmative action and allow the law to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10724)|
| 2:58:52| So would that change the motion that Commissioner Hammond has posed before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10732)|
| 2:59:00| Well, I believe the intent was not to opt out of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:04| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| The intent is to allow permit holders to carry their guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| So that would be that we're voting to not opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10748)|
| 2:59:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| That's an affirmation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| I just want to make it clear, simple, easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| Don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10764)|
| 2:59:25| And legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| Regardless, you cannot legislate guns away from criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10773)|
| 2:59:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| This process has been, you know, a very difficult one for me in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| I personally am for this amendment as it applies to these what they call lonely type parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10785)|
| 2:59:53| campgrounds, places, trails and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10793)|
| 3:00:00| The one area that bothers me, and I do say this with a little bit of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10800)|
| 3:00:06| is the recreational ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| I officiate sports, and no one, a fan is short for fanatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:19| And when you're talking about little Johnny or little Susie out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| I know we've heard a lot to the differences, but people become irate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:30| Rational people lose their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10830)|
| 3:00:34| If you don't believe that, you should have been around Neyland Stadium when we lost to UCLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10834)|
| 3:00:40| So, you know, that emotion is what I'm concerned with, that uncontrolled emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:48| Yeah, if they had an opportunity to count to ten, then I'm sure they would calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10848)|
| 3:00:56| But, you know, I've seen situations where players have been hurt, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| a leg broken on their child and they feel that it was an inappropriate hit, whether it was or it not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10861)|
| 3:01:08| If they feel that way, there's a rush of emotions that come over rational people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10868)|
| 3:01:15| that come over law-abiding people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10875)|
| 3:01:18| And I think every adult has probably experienced that sometimes in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10878)|
| 3:01:27| The issue, so that's my only issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| So I'm looking at it from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| Again, from campgrounds, walking trails, you know, IMES, nature center, that type of facility, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10892)|
| 3:01:41| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:44| I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10904)|
| 3:01:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10905)|
| 3:01:46| I only have three minutes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| So I just want to make sure that we fully understand what we're opening up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10910)|
| 3:01:58| And I would challenge the state legislators, folks running for governor, to say that they have not seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10918)|
| 3:02:08| We've all seen people become irate, rational folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:13| So that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| And I'd like to ask Doug Patel, put him on the spot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| but I'd like to ask him to come up and just talk a little bit about that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| Commissioner McKenzie, I guess I can sort of echo your comments, too, with some of the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10956)|
| 3:02:40| And I think mine come from the feedback we've got from some of our groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:45| We sent out an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10965)|
| 3:02:46| We've got about 30 groups we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10966)|
| 3:02:49| We heard back from, I think, 12 or 13 of them, and 10 out of those 12 or 13 were opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10969)|
| 3:02:56| very much for the same reasons you have, that they work every day in a youth environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| And they have concern, not so much from the standpoint of somebody, you know, having a gun for personal protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10980)|
| 3:03:05| I think most folks understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| But the fact that you do have situations where, you know, normally rational folks do have to act differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10987)|
| 3:03:13| especially when their kids are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| So I think, again, the same concerns that many of our groups have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=10995)|
| 3:03:23| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| I would just like to say also that one of the reasons that I brought this forward was because our Greenways Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11006)|
| 3:03:35| and the Parks and Rec Advisory Board both recommended opting out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| and the administration, I believe, supports that position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:48| And among my district, who I represent, the feeling is different from the constituents that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11028)|
| 3:03:59| So not everyone in Knox County feels exactly the same on this issue, nor would I expect them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:05| I think my biggest concern also is safety at ball fields where people do lose control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11045)|
| 3:04:18| I am worried about accidental shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11058)|
| 3:04:23| I'm worried about, and I know that a lot of people who are here today are very responsible gun owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:29| and they go out and they train and they take target practice on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:35| but there are a lot of permit holders who do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| Handguns are not the easiest thing to aim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| I'm worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| I'm concerned that the city has opted out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| We have some greenways where city and county greenways are interconnecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| so you would be able to carry a gun on part of the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| but then you'd have to find some place to walk on the city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:07| We have county parks that are within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| Parks that are used for school activities are opted out automatically by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:22| That's a lot for people to keep up with, to keep track of, to keep straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| It's a confusing patchwork of laws and parks and greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| and I think that unfortunately the sheriff's department was not able to provide me with statistics in county parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11134)|
| 3:05:45| but I imagine they would mirror the statistics for city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| In fact, I would expect them to be even lower because of the lower density in the county than in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11149)|
| 3:05:55| but I know that our city parks are extremely safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| that the majority of the small percentage of crimes that have taken place in city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11158)|
| 3:06:05| had to do with breaking and entering or vandalizing vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11165)|
| 3:06:08| and you can't use a firearm in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| That's forbidden by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| Also, I brought this forward because this is what I wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| was a really good open debate in our community about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11180)|
| 3:06:26| I didn't think it was fair to just let this pass without having some discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:32| It's too important an issue to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| I'm not even going to take three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:42| In fact, I think everybody here knows how I feel, so I'm not going to even debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| I just want to thank Mr. Huff and all of the work that he did getting carry permits available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11207)|
| 3:06:55| because I'm alive today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| I am alive today because this state had carry permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| and I just want to thank him for all the work he did in the early days getting permits available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11223)|
| 3:07:09| and I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| In reply to Mr. McKenzie's concern a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11237)|
| 3:07:23| in the state law it is prohibited to take it in a park where there's a school scholastic athletic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11243)|
| 3:07:34| So that part's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| That's in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11256)|
| 3:07:37| That's in the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| We can't do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11258)|
| 3:07:41| So I'm like Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11265)|
| 3:07:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:49| I want to just echo my same thoughts as Commissioner McKenzie has in terms of our rec leagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11269)|
| 3:07:56| and Commissioner Brown, I think only on school property, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11276)|
| 3:08:05| It doesn't cover rec leagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| Well, I checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| The reason why I'm even commenting on this is I had checked with Joe Jarrett before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11288)|
| 3:08:13| because I had the same thing in terms of I had, you know, the rec teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11293)|
| 3:08:19| And, Mr. Jarrett, right now the law is in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11299)|
| 3:08:24| and has been for several days where you can carry your guns in our parks and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11304)|
| 3:08:29| The way I understood from Mr. Jarrett, and he can clarify if I misunderstood that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11309)|
| 3:08:35| we can only opt out completely out of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| We can't say you're allowed to have guns in greenways, forests, campgrounds, except rec ballgames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11319)|
| 3:08:48| Is that correct, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| Members of the Commission, the way the Attorney General has interpreted this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| is that essentially the state preempts this body of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11335)|
| 3:09:00| The only option you have is either to opt out of the law or remain in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11340)|
| 3:09:04| There are laws in the books that preclude handguns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11344)|
| 3:09:08| Even if it's permitted in a park, if there's a school sanction function, they are not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11348)|
| 3:09:13| But beyond that, the Attorney General has consistently thus far weighed in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11353)|
| 3:09:18| And that's all the law you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| This is a new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| It hasn't been thrown to the courts yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| We don't have any black letters, stereotypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| In other words, we don't have any preexisting appellate law we can rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| We rely on the plain reading of the statute and that which the Attorney General has opined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| So just using an example here, the rec leagues that would play, say, at Tommy Shumpert Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:43| if we pass to allow guns, you could take your gun in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11383)|
| 3:09:48| Now, Central High School baseball team will be using that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| and people would not be allowed to have their guns in there because that is a school activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11392)|
| 3:09:59| So, you know, there is a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:04| but there's still a small majority of people that are affected with the rec in terms of rec leagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11404)|
| 3:10:10| considering the ones that aren't affected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| So I ask that, and there's no way we can opt out of any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| We just have to clearly opt out or opt for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11417)|
| 3:10:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| Yes, Doug, I see you're up there at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| I've got a question I want to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:28| How many stabbings, beatings, whatever have we had of our umpires in the last five years, let's say, at our parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11428)|
| 3:10:39| None that I can recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| The reason I say that is, you know, we've got very dangerous weapons that are at every baseball game now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11440)|
| 3:10:46| They're called baseball bats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:47| And I was just wondering if we had a lot of beatings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| Well, we've not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| And, frankly, we've not had a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11450)|
| 3:10:52| We have had altercations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| We've had folks arrested in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| In particular, and around our youth areas where folks get heated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11456)|
| 3:10:59| I mean, I'm getting the impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| I don't have any young children, so I can't really comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| But I get the impression these baseball games are just extremely dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| I mean, is it really that dangerous there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| I don't think it's that dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:10| I think the concern from our volunteers that are in these parks every single night is just an honest concern that when you have folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11470)|
| 3:11:18| the emotions run high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11478)|
| 3:11:20| If a firearm is in a pocket, is there an opportunity to pull that out and make a worse situation out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11480)|
| 3:11:25| That's their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| Yeah, I guess my only response to that, and it's just a common sense thing, I am not, like some people on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11486)|
| 3:11:33| I'm not a permit carrier holder, and I obey the law, so that means I don't carry a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11493)|
| 3:11:38| But if we have these weapons lying around now, baseball bats, if we have people carrying knives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11498)|
| 3:11:45| I mean, why would someone think that you're going to resort to shooting one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| when you're not going to pick up a bat and hit somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| I mean, to me it just seems like you're not going to resort to lethal violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11512)|
| 3:11:57| when you're not taking the advantage of baseball bats and those other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11517)|
| 3:12:03| A couple of other comments that I've heard on people is that they say, well, our parks are relatively safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:09| The same comment I would have is that our rest areas on the interstates are relatively safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11529)|
| 3:12:13| but we know what happened to the Lily Lid family a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| We would say also that when a couple of our young people go on dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11538)|
| 3:12:23| and they're not really doing anything wrong except minding their own business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| they should be relatively safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| But we've got court cases, as has been mentioned a little bit earlier, what's happening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11548)|
| 3:12:34| And we might even say that if you're in church, you should be relatively safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11554)|
| 3:12:40| and that anything that happens there is just an insignificant statistic to all of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11560)|
| 3:12:47| But the problem is that when you're a victim of a crime and you have to deal with these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11567)|
| 3:12:53| it's not an insignificant statistic, it's a very real thing that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| And I want to make a quote right now, and I don't know if anyone can guess who made this quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11577)|
| 3:13:02| but it was made on May 22, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| And it says, there is no evidence that guns in our parks has any significant impact on public health or safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11585)|
| 3:13:15| And that comment was made by President Barack Obama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| when he signed into law allowing guns in our national parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11599)|
| 3:13:26| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11609)|
| 3:13:33| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| He's officiated the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11616)|
| 3:13:37| I've been the coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| I've coached basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| I've coached baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| And I have seen the people that you would think are the most reasonable people out there turn absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11622)|
| 3:13:54| Just you wouldn't recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| The anger, just unreasonableness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11637)|
| 3:14:03| And I really was truly hoping that there would be a way to try to craft this, but evidently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11643)|
| 3:14:11| You know, I agree with the Second Amendment rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11651)|
| 3:14:16| I believe we should be able to bear arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11656)|
| 3:14:19| I wish there was a way that, you know, just because Johnny and Susie are at a rec league game at one of our county-owned parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:31| instead of having to be playing basketball inside a school where there can't be guns, it's the same kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11671)|
| 3:14:37| I coach CBFO basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| You can't carry a gun into the school where they're playing basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11679)|
| 3:14:44| unless you can carry the gun to Farragut baseball where they're playing at our same kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11684)|
| 3:14:51| They're just at our park instead of at our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:56| And so it's put me in a dilemma because I do believe in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11696)|
| 3:15:02| and I was hoping there was a way to have a compromise here, but Commissioner McKenzie is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:10| in his assessment from the coaching side as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| And, you know, I'm really not sure how I'm going to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:21| Mr. Chairman, if I could ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:24| If I could ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| And this may not be something the law director can tell us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11725)|
| 3:15:28| but I think it's important and this issue will come up, as Commissioner Carringer pointed out, like a Tommy Shumpert park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11728)|
| 3:15:34| And we have 16 of the other parks that we do host high school and middle school events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| So in a park like that, and, again, this may be something we have to flush out later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| but if we have one ball field out of four with a high school event on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11742)|
| 3:15:47| as well as a dog park and a greenway trail coming through that particular park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| is the entire park then off limits to a permit holder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| And does the county then have a duty to post that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| So those are questions that we probably need to have answered in terms of how we administer this new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11758)|
| 3:16:03| So there are some questions here that I think that will need to be flushed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| as well as leased pieces of property that we have, how does the law apply there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11766)|
| 3:16:11| and greenways that are on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| So there's still some questions about exactly how this will work that I don't think we have all the answers for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11773)|
| 3:16:18| My other question is, to go along with that, is it only during the time that the school event is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:26| so let's say the Tommy Shumpert park, if there's not a ball game going on by Central High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11786)|
| 3:16:33| or any other school activity, does that open it up to carry a gun, or is it always off limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11793)|
| 3:16:42| I mean, I'm just not sure how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| Mr. Law Director, do you have any, bring any clarity to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| It's my understanding, based upon that which is written thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| is that the park would be off limits during the course of its use by a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11812)|
| 3:16:57| But if it's not being used by a school, then the park would be open to persons with a lawful carry permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11817)|
| 3:17:04| So, in other words, if a school uses it one day, that doesn't henceforth make it out of bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:10| And just to add, you know, I've had a gun pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11830)|
| 3:17:15| and it was a situation where I was going to work, I was a student at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11835)|
| 3:17:24| I made a right-hand turn on a green light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11844)|
| 3:17:29| And because the driver coming along Kingston Pike felt like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11849)|
| 3:17:35| because he was pulling a boat, shouldn't have to stop at his red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:40| And then when he got mad at me, he decided to pull his gun out and shake it at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11860)|
| 3:17:45| And I did get his license plate, and he did have a carry permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11865)|
| 3:17:50| So, although I have great respect for the NRA and great respect for most handgun carry permit holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11870)|
| 3:18:01| there are a few that aren't as responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| So I'm going to keep that in mind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| I appreciate those who have come and spoken about the gun issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11892)|
| 3:18:17| and I appreciate the respect with which you have accorded us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:23| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie and Commissioner Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:30| and share some of the other concerns that have been expressed around this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| A statistic that I think I'm aware of is that in Knox County there are about 425,000 citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11914)|
| 3:18:43| Of those, less than 15,000 have a carry permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:49| My math tells me that's less than 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11929)|
| 3:18:54| Now, in my district, I have gotten, as all of you all have, a lot of e-mails and phone calls and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11934)|
| 3:19:02| My district apparently feels a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| I find comfort with the position I have taken, and obviously as a co-sponsor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11944)|
| 3:19:12| my position is fairly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| And I would like for us to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| I know this is a hard thing to do at this point, especially given the situation in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11958)|
| 3:19:25| having upheld their ordinance to not have guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| I think we add an unnecessary bit of confusion for our citizens that may inadvertently be in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:39| and often, I don't know, because I use the parks, I use the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| and I'm unaware, just like Doug Patel said, of real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| To me, it's almost like finding an answer to something that really isn't a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:52| But I do hope we will consider favorably, well, I guess we're considering Mr. Hammond's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11992)|
| 3:19:59| so at this point I would be opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| But I wish we would consider putting this off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:05| and I don't mind at all listening to people and scheduling a public forum if we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12005)|
| 3:20:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12011)|
| 3:20:14| Commissioner Kingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| Contrary to what everybody is saying, these parks aren't safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| The greenways aren't safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| This greenway that runs between Southern Avenue and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12024)|
| 3:20:28| just a few years ago there were several women raped on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12028)|
| 3:20:32| We don't know how many of these women were raped that never came forward because of the shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12032)|
| 3:20:38| It turned out that the guy that was doing the raping lived there, had an ankle bracelet on him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| and would walk out of his house, go down and rape a woman, and go right back into his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12044)|
| 3:20:48| They likely never caught him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12048)|
| 3:20:51| So I think that we should all uphold the Constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12051)|
| 3:20:57| You heard me say that when we made appointments people didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12057)|
| 3:21:03| I said I cannot go against the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:07| They can holler Black Wednesday all they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12067)|
| 3:21:10| I'm here, and I believe that the Constitution of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| and the Constitution of the United States is the only power that people out here that work for a living have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:20| against the criminal elements and the people that have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| And I will always vote to uphold those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| And the Constitution, both of them, says we have the right to bear arms, and that will be my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12086)|
| 3:21:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12093)|
| 3:21:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12097)|
| 3:21:38| I had a question for Doug, and this is really in response to Commissioner Brown's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:46| I think the initial statement was that school events were going to be opted out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12106)|
| 3:21:51| but that's somehow saving a lion's share of recreational activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12111)|
| 3:21:57| Roughly speaking, you know, thinking of the sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| what percentage of the games that are played are high school events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12121)|
| 3:22:07| as opposed to solely in your Prairie View Parks and Rec events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12127)|
| 3:22:12| Is it less than 5%, less than 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| I mean, just generally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| Boy, it would be hard for me to count, but certainly no more than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| Probably much less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12140)|
| 3:22:21| So a majority of the events there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| I just wanted to be clear about that, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| And just let me be clear about something else, and that's that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| a lot of times a no vote means this, or you get pigeonholed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12152)|
| 3:22:38| Let me be clear, and I know a lot have been brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| it's been brought up, the Lillied Horror horrific event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:48| and I guess more recently this Kirsten and Newsom event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12168)|
| 3:22:53| You know, as it relates to this trial that's going on on the other side of the breeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12173)|
| 3:22:57| we're about to take up, be taken up, if and when they convict, you know, this next culprit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12177)|
| 3:23:07| I'm really hoping that they opt out of the needle and give strictly electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12187)|
| 3:23:12| So let me just, you know, a lot of times people want to, oh, well, you're for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| Since you're against this opt out, it means you're against, you know, everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| And I hate those pigeonholes, and I hate those stereotypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12202)|
| 3:23:26| So that's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| I just want to make sure everyone understands my issue is that is what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12208)|
| 3:23:34| That is my issue, and that is the only reason that I'm wanting to opt out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12214)|
| 3:23:40| And even if this vote, I guess this vote passes, I'm still going to ask our law director to continue to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12220)|
| 3:23:51| I mean, I don't know whether it was just a cursory look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| but I'm going to ask the law department to dig into this to see if there's other things that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12234)|
| 3:24:02| to keep the guns out of the recreational facilities where youth are playing their sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12242)|
| 3:24:12| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| Yes, I wanted to respond to some of the things that Rick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12255)|
| 3:24:22| Our rest stops get a whole lot more traffic than our county parks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12262)|
| 3:24:31| And the man who came into our church and killed people last year was stopped by people who weren't carrying guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:41| I also dislike being pigeonholed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:46| I don't presently have a carry permit, but I grew up hunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12286)|
| 3:24:51| I shot skeet and trap in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| I was rated an expert marksman every year that I was in ROTC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12293)|
| 3:24:58| I've been a victim of violent crime, and I'm not just speaking about when my family was shot at last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12298)|
| 3:25:06| I've been assaulted. I've been raped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12306)|
| 3:25:09| I'm very aware that there's evil in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12309)|
| 3:25:12| I have dealt with it firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| My concern is for the children in these rec leagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12315)|
| 3:25:20| Even one child who is injured or killed is too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12320)|
| 3:25:29| And the reason I think that you don't see people stabbing and swinging baseball bats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12329)|
| 3:25:34| is because that requires a certain proximity to your victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12334)|
| 3:25:38| With a gun, you don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| You can shoot from a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12340)|
| 3:25:44| And that's my concern is what's going on with the rec leagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12344)|
| 3:25:49| and a very confusing patchwork set of parks and laws for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12349)|
| 3:25:57| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| Commissioner Ivanhoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| I guess everybody's been talking about what they're for and what they're against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:09| because I do have a handgun permit and I don't have a gun on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12369)|
| 3:26:12| I ain't going to say that Lumpy's loaded or he's not loaded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12372)|
| 3:26:14| but I do think that the Second Amendment does give us the right to carry and bear arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12374)|
| 3:26:19| to protect our families and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12379)|
| 3:26:22| I live on Victor Ashe Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| One morning about two months ago, there was two guys in my field at 3 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| I didn't run and grab my gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| I did run out there and holler at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12390)|
| 3:26:32| But now I feel like that if they had got my lawnmower or my weed eater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| I feel like I should have been able to take after them with some kind of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12396)|
| 3:26:39| because I guarantee they had something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| And, therefore, I'm ready to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| You know, we've played around with this all day, and it's time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12404)|
| 3:26:48| You know, Booms Day, 200,000 people were down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:51| Was anybody shot at Booms Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| I don't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| And a lot of booming went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12415)|
| 3:26:56| There may have been some people down there shooting their guns off and nobody knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| But Market Square, we can take our weapons to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12419)|
| 3:27:03| You know, I coached basketball at Badger Field and Enskip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12423)|
| 3:27:08| Sure, those people lose their cool, but I've never seen a weapon in 30 years drawn on those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12428)|
| 3:27:13| I mean, it could happen tomorrow and it could happen any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12433)|
| 3:27:17| But sensible people that has their permits are knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12437)|
| 3:27:20| When you get a driver's license, it's your responsibility to control that vehicle on the right side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12440)|
| 3:27:25| You can run over somebody and kill them with a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| Sure, we have road raids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12447)|
| 3:27:28| People do shoot birdies at you, draw a ball bat at you, maybe point a gun at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12448)|
| 3:27:33| That's going to happen regardless of what we do here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| But I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12456)|
| 3:27:37| Are you calling for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12457)|

| 3:29:43| How many of them would admit to carrying in the parks now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| Would you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12587)|

| 3:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| Certainly we know that there is a whole lot more than that in the parks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12597)|
| 3:30:01| How many incidents have we had in the last year, two, five, ten involving guns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12601)|
| 3:30:08| Can anybody remember one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12608)|

| 3:30:30| I hope folks did listen to the impassioned words of my colleague, Commissioner Proyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12630)|
| 3:30:35| I bow to her experience and her courage in bringing forth this issue for our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12635)|
| 3:30:41| and I regret that her motives were improperly and rudely challenged from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12641)|
| 3:30:50| I went to my dad was an umpire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| He saw fan outrage personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12654)|
| 3:30:59| And you don't have to rely just on anecdotes or personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12659)|
| 3:31:03| The National Association of Sports Officials reports 100 incidents this past year of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12663)|
| 3:31:11| at various events, physical contact, et cetera, between coaches, fans, players, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| Even if it's just a handful of instances where someone loses control, even a well-intentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12676)|
| 3:31:23| well-trained, well-regarded person, that's a risk I don't want to take at our community sporting events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12683)|
| 3:31:29| and that's a reason that this overly broad permission must be voted against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12689)|
| 3:31:39| Seeing no lights on, the motion on the floor is to substitute motion on the floor is to allow guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12699)|
| 3:31:52| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12712)|

| 3:31:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| Mr. Chairman, so the motion is to do nothing to change state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12720)|
| 3:32:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12725)|

| 3:32:08| This is to affirm the state law to allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| Yeah, affirm state law to allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| An aye vote would be to affirm state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| A no vote would be to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12735)|

| 3:33:40| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:51| I would like to say a couple of things after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12831)|
| 3:33:55| I think it was apparent that which way this vote would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12835)|
| 3:33:59| but I would like to commend Ms. Broyles for her courage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12839)|
| 3:34:04| as well as several other speakers that were in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:09| opting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12849)|
| 3:34:10| I think there are many issues certainly that probably could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12850)|
| 3:34:16| have been vetted and investigated a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| if we'd waited 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12859)|
| 3:34:23| This is a classic wedge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12863)|
| 3:34:26| I hate to see the issue used in public as a political hammer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12866)|
| 3:34:34| and it is being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| It's being used to beat on the city mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| and I think that's totally out of order and disrespectful to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12881)|
| 3:34:48| I hope that, well, this body has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12888)|
| 3:34:54| I have respect for the cumulative voice of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12894)|
| 3:34:59| and no matter which side of the issue that I'm on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12899)|
| 3:35:03| and I think we should respect each other in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12903)|
| 3:35:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12907)|
| 3:35:08| We need to take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12908)|

| 3:35:26| I'm going to give Michael Horms a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12926)|
| 3:35:31| Mike Horms, Knox County Chief of Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12931)|

| 3:35:35| One minute, one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12935)|
| 3:35:36| You have a memo on your desk, and the reason I'm bringing this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12936)|
| 3:35:41| you get so many memos I don't want you to lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| December the 7th at noon is our legislative luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12943)|
| 3:35:47| That will be with our state senators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| and state general assembly members at Calhoun's at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12950)|
| 3:35:54| A little difference this year, we're doing it earlier, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12954)|
| 3:35:58| Number two, we're not doing it with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| The city has five new city councilmen coming on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| so we're doing it with just county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| Number three, we're asking you in advance to submit your issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| next year that you'd like to see legislatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| Maybe none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12973)|
| 3:36:14| You may have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12974)|
| 3:36:15| We'll comprise a list of those and actually present those to the delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12975)|
| 3:36:22| as issues the county commission would like to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12982)|
| 3:36:25| I think last year we had maybe some communication issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| and I think it's important that we actually talk face-to-face with our delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12988)|
| 3:36:33| Sometimes those meetings end up just being kumbaya and barbecue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12993)|
| 3:36:39| but if we have issues we want to address in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| let's talk to it then and our lobbyists will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| That's one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13003)|
| 3:36:44| Item number two, Wednesday at 1130 at Tommy Shumpert Park is our senior picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13004)|
| 3:36:49| We have over 600 citizens already confirmed, senior citizens that attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13009)|
| 3:36:55| Usually, we have at least a couple hundred show up at Don RSVP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13015)|
| 3:36:59| so we're having a luncheon with our seniors, Tommy Shumpert Park, 1130 Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13019)|
| 3:37:05| and we're going to have some exhibits there and also some health-related things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13025)|
| 3:37:10| We're going to deal with the seniors there on such issues as flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13030)|
| 3:37:14| Hey, Mike, so we just send those to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13034)|
| 3:37:18| Yeah, and I will compile those and send them all back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| so the entire county commission will see every issue you submit before we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13042)|
| 3:37:27| it won't be a secretive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| It will be a list we'll compile and give back to you, but discuss that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13049)|
| 3:37:34| December 7th, noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| Commissioner Grove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13056)|
| 3:37:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13058)|
| 3:37:39| The president of the League of Women Voters, Jamie Dobbs, is here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13059)|
| 3:37:43| and she wanted to read a statement on behalf of the league dealing with land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13063)|
| 3:37:48| and stormwater issues, and unfortunately, she's going to have to leave between 515 and 530,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13068)|
| 3:37:55| and so I've asked the chair if he would allow her to read her statement now before we get to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13075)|
| 3:38:03| And he has graciously agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13083)|
| 3:38:05| So, Jamie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13085)|
| 3:38:13| She broke five pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13096)|
| 3:38:17| I'm Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive, Knoxville, and I am the president of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13099)|
| 3:38:26| Thank you for this opportunity, commissioners, to state the league's position on land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13106)|
| 3:38:32| and to express the league's support of your consideration of a more comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13112)|
| 3:38:38| and proactive development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| Our position states, we believe that the citizens of Knox County should leave our land, water, air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13121)|
| 3:38:50| and cultural resources to our children in better condition than when we became responsible for county planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13130)|
| 3:38:58| Therefore, we support policies that place restrictions on development of ridges, slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13138)|
| 3:39:06| open spaces, and vegetation that have been identified as critical to maintaining our community's air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13146)|
| 3:39:13| and water quality, our biodiversity, functioning habitats, and or historic scenic character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13153)|
| 3:39:21| Additionally, we support programs and strategies which conserve natural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13161)|
| 3:39:27| reduce storm water pollution, and protect waterways by smart growth practices and other concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13167)|
| 3:39:35| which will be detailed in a forthcoming letter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13175)|
| 3:39:40| Overall, we support the principles and strategies stated in the 2033 Knox County General Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13180)|
| 3:39:47| as well as land use planning processes and policies which ensure coordination of planning by all agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13187)|
| 3:39:57| and institutions which affect land use in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13197)|
| 3:40:01| We support staff studies and a public input process prior to any plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13201)|
| 3:40:08| We support training curriculum of all newly elected and appointed city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13208)|
| 3:40:14| and county officials to include best practices for land development and growth management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13214)|
| 3:40:21| Again, we will provide more detail in a follow-up letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13221)|
| 3:40:26| So, commissioners, the League of Women Voters of Knoxville-Knox County is committed to education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13226)|
| 3:40:31| and advocacy on these issues, and our land use and development studies continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13231)|
| 3:40:37| On February 16th of next year, we will host a public presentation on Knox County environmental standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13237)|
| 3:40:44| at the Beck Cultural Center for our February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| The speakers will include representatives from Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13247)|
| 3:40:51| and the Tennessee Clean Water Network, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13251)|
| 3:40:55| We invite you to bring your lunch and join us and to see our new website for the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13255)|
| 3:41:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13262)|
| 3:41:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| Mr. Chairman, you had mentioned the two resolutions, 905 and 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13267)|
| 3:41:12| There's also 911 included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13272)|
| 3:41:14| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13277)|
| 3:41:18| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, can I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13278)|
| 3:41:21| We had given the people who were here to speak on the guns and parts issue the option of speaking during the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13281)|
| 3:41:27| or speaking when we were considering it, and we got rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13287)|
| 3:41:33| and forgot to give the people who deferred an opportunity to speak, so I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| Everyone spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13298)|
| 3:41:40| No, there were several people who wanted to spoke who didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13300)|
| 3:41:43| They didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| Then I guess we won't be apologizing to them, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13305)|
| 3:41:51| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| On page 15, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13316)|
| 3:42:01| Tennessee approving the charter of the Knox County Audit Committee, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13321)|
| 3:42:08| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13328)|
| 3:42:10| N-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13330)|
| 3:42:12| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13334)|
| 3:42:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| Properly moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13341)|
| 3:42:24| Yeah, I'd like to hear from, I think, John Key at this time if he would come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13344)|
| 3:42:39| Mr. and Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I didn't expect to be first up on this particular subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13359)|
| 3:42:45| but I guess when you're called upon first, you go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13365)|
| 3:42:50| I know there are others who probably want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13370)|
| 3:42:53| I'm here on my own behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13373)|
| 3:42:56| I'm speaking as a person or a citizen who's interested in how Knox County governs itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13376)|
| 3:43:03| I know others are similarly concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| and I'm sure that that interest likewise extends to members of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13385)|
| 3:43:13| I'm going to start out by saying, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| I don't have objection to the creation or the empowerment to a degree of the audit committee that's the subject of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13395)|
| 3:43:24| particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| While there may be and probably likely is no objection to creating it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13406)|
| 3:43:32| and empowering it to conduct activities, advisory and supervisory in nature, to assure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13412)|
| 3:43:39| as the Local Government Modernization Act at CCA 9-3-401 itself says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13419)|
| 3:43:46| to assure that local governments maintain adequate accounting records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13426)|
| 3:43:51| and comply with generally accepted accounting principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13431)|
| 3:43:56| While that is true, there are numerous questions and concerns that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13436)|
| 3:44:01| and have heard others express as to when, how, why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13441)|
| 3:44:07| and to what effect the committee may undertake its broadly described duties in the current charter that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13447)|
| 3:44:17| And in the interest of time, I'm going to start out by saying that I believe perhaps all of you recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13457)|
| 3:44:27| that currently office holders here are subject to an annual external audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13467)|
| 3:44:32| an internal audit that has capability for being exercised pretty much at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13472)|
| 3:44:39| They all participate in providing information to the comprehensive report of financial transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13479)|
| 3:44:44| I think perhaps with one exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13484)|
| 3:44:46| all of them provide monthly reports to the county mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13486)|
| 3:44:51| and have for some time been providing copies of that to internal audit and to this body, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13491)|
| 3:44:59| As to some others of the office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| additionally there are tax reports due to various state agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13501)|
| 3:45:06| I want to say in the interest of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13506)|
| 3:45:09| I don't think it's really easy or that this may even be the right kind of forum to deal with the kind of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13509)|
| 3:45:18| that I see that are the product of my having said a number of times to this body and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13518)|
| 3:45:27| that it's the law of unintended consequence that you first end up having to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13527)|
| 3:45:33| when you undertake certain legislative actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13533)|
| 3:45:37| I submit to you that there are numerous undefined terms in this charter that you, by taking action today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13537)|
| 3:45:48| in essence, cede to this committee to define those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13548)|
| 3:45:54| And in addition to that, by adopting this charter as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13554)|
| 3:46:01| you would be ceding to the committee all definitions, the setting up of procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13561)|
| 3:46:06| and parameters of that body, the requirement for reporting, the selection of external auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13566)|
| 3:46:13| approving the staffing budget and other subject matter of your internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13573)|
| 3:46:21| and having, in essence, all auditors report directly to the committee as opposed to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13581)|
