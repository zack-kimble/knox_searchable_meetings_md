| 0:00:40| I'll take a few moments of silence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=40)|
| 0:00:53| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=63)|
| 0:01:15| I'm excited. I want to take a moment and welcome our newest board member, Mr. Travis Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| Welcome. Travis won the primary election as District 8 board member two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| So it was a very quick turnaround. It's on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| And he was appointed by Knox County Commission at a special session yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| to fulfill Mr. McMillan's remaining term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=94)|

| 0:01:41| Is there anything you'd like to say, Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| You can also learn how to turn your microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| I just want to say I'm grateful to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| I appreciate the folks in the 8th District putting me here, ready to get to work and excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=113)|
| 0:02:02| It was a quick turnaround. It's kind of been a whirlwind, but I'm happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| We're happy you're here too. Welcome again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Thank you to everyone who's in attendance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| We would just ask that you be respectful and courteous at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| And please be mindful that the sound is carried very easily in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| So if you need to speak to your neighbor, take a call, just step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| Finally, I want to wish all of our students, families and staff a well-deserved restful spring break next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| I know it's much deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Board members, we have a few changes to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| First, as a result of discussion at the work session on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| you did receive an email yesterday explaining that the attachment on item 7C6 has been updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| and attached with Mr. Dupler's signature, approving it in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Also, a second version of policy D140 being considered as item 8M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| with some clarifying changes in line 12, has also been attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| So just keep in mind that any motion on that item will just need to identify whether it's version 1 or version 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| Additionally, you received an email today regarding the addition of a memorandum of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| for Shura Foundation, which is one of our 21st Century Community Learning Center partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| that's a mouthful, serving some of our Region 5 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| They made a late request to be added to the list of partners in agenda item 9A for their grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| And since that item is time-sensitive, Superintendent Griswick and I agreed to that addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| So if you have any questions, we can certainly discuss that when it comes to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| Are there any other requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| A motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Christie. All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| All right, motion carries. And then I'm going to kick it off to Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| I think we have a few special recognitions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you, Madam Chair. We do. We're going to begin. I think I'm going to go to Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| All right, perfect. He's going to go to the podium to recognize our award schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| We had 24 of those, so he's going to speak to that tonight. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| All right. Thank you, Dr. Reiswick, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| We're always excited to get to recognize great achievements, and obviously we've really got some exciting news tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| I think when we think about the work we do here in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| In February, the State Department of Education announced the latest group of award schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| based on the data that came from last school year, the 2022-2023 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| The reward school is the state's highest designation given to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| and it recognizes schools that are making gains in terms of both their achievement and their growth for all students and student groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Only nine schools from our district received the reward designation in the last cycle, but that number rose to 24 schools for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| So we were really excited about that significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| We're extremely proud of the hard work by our teachers, our principals and students, and the school staff that made this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| We're also encouraged that this is momentum that really is being reflected in other assessments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| As you know, TCAP scores that were released for last year, we showed a gain of nearly 5% in third grade reading proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| which was the highest level in the district's history, is what we reached last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| and the math proficiency for grades six through eight rose by 4.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| Over the last two years, our district has made the excellence and foundational skills priority a huge piece of our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| and a huge piece of the work at the school level, and these results show that the hard work in our schools is paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| We'll continue to work to make sure more schools join this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| and in the meantime, we want to take a moment to celebrate this great milestone that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Before I close, I do want to give a shout out to each of this year's reward schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| and we're going to ask them to be able to come up and receive a poster, banner, and take a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| So we're going to ask that we'll begin with Region 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Yep, and they're right here, ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=360)|

| 0:32:26| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| So this is a state law that increased the time from 30 minutes to an hour credit or half credit to a full credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1953)|
| 0:32:44| And so basically our job is to make sure that they're following the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Yeah, Mr. Digby, you want to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Madam Chair, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| So this provision was in state law previously, but as you alluded to, Reverend Butler, I mean it was at one time the half credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1979)|
| 0:33:09| and then this last year the legislature extended it to a full credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| But the door was open for this through the release time law, which has been in effect for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=1994)|
| 0:33:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Do we have any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| That motion was made by Ms. Horne and seconded by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| Yeah, why don't we do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2021)|

| 0:36:45| We do have some public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Aya Agale, and I may have said her name wrong, and if I did, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| But if you'll state your name and county of residence, and then you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| I'm Aya Agale, Knox County, and I'm a sophomore at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| I'm here today to tell you a story that has repeated itself time and time again around our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| Last year, I was in geometry class when my best friend's face suddenly dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| She leaned over and asked me and our other friends, do you guys have any pads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| All of us quickly shook our heads because none of us had thought to bring any that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| I remember how quickly my best friend's mood shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| She started biting her lips, and her hands started to shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| What was she going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| None of her friends had anything, and the only teacher in the room was a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| I told her that the nurse sometimes has pads in her office, but it wasn't a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| Another girl said she could try to see if someone in another class could meet her in the bathroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| but that's technically class cutting, and you could get in trouble for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| With no easy option, my friend decided to just go to the bathroom and see what she could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| When she came back in, her shoulders were hunched over in embarrassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| She told us that she had called her parents, but they were both at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| She ended up leaving early because someone saw red on the back of her jeans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| I wish I could say that this was a rare occurrence, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Since then, countless girls have left early because they didn't have period products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and even more have had to suffer in discomfort, hoping they could just disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| Now you might be thinking to yourself that this seems like a problem for us girls to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| We should be better prepared for these situations, but not every girl can afford these products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| Almost 13% of our county lives under the poverty line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Our schools are able to give us toilet paper, soap, and even computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| but they can't give us the basic necessity, period products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Now you might be thinking to yourself that this seems like a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| Oh, the mission of Knox County is to promote education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| but by not having easy access to the basic necessity of these products in the bathroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| half of the student population is being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| I understand that lately the school board has been trying to bridge inequalities between different schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| so I would also like to let you know that there are certain schools who have free period products in their bathrooms already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| They have PTO committees who can, but not always, pay for this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| but other schools don't have the same opportunities to afford to pay for this themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Knox County seeks to be a beacon of change and innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| We can see this through the implementation of the 865 Academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| but nothing would show change in leadership more than putting these products in our school bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| Twenty-five states have implemented legislation for free period products in their school bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Twenty-five states, but our state does not want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| This initiative would be costly, and it is understandable to be wary of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| but I urge you to consider it as the movement for it grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| There's a petition in our schools that already has over 500 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you, Aya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| Warren Smith. Warren Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2369)|
| 0:39:38| They're checking at the moment to see if anybody has an overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2378)|
| 0:39:47| I'll move on to the next one, and then we can go back to that one if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Tiffany Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2392)|
| 0:40:03| Sorry, Tiffany Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| All right, I will move on, and if they come in, we'll happily go back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| Courtney Piper. Is Courtney here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2415)|
| 0:40:25| Very good. I apologize. I know it's a little difficult getting from overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Tiffany Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Tiffany, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2432)|
| 0:40:45| Tiffany Matthews, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| I'm a proud parent of four children, two of whom have IEPs for autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| I want to express my gratitude for the excellent work done by the special education teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| teachers, aides, and the rest of the staff at New Hopewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| However, I wish they had more support from the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| I wish they had more support from the central office to truly achieve the superintendent's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| fourth stated priority of success for every student and uphold my son's legal educational rights under IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| It is unfair for my son's teachers and special education teachers to spend time outside of their regular planning hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| preparing modified content, which takes hours a day to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| They should be fairly compensated for this extra time or have someone from the central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| or anyone to help prepare modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| They deserve more support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| During last summer's board of education meeting, Jason Myers claimed that there is a bank of modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| available for teachers to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| However, this was a complete lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| There is no bank of modifications, but there are 64 exemplars available for grades three through eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| in the four core content areas for an imaginary child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| After attending an IEP meeting with a friend and the general education teacher responsible for modifying content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| I discovered that the teacher had not seen the exemplars or the presentation of do's and don'ts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| of modified content created by KCS employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| This is a significant concern because they have only received training on alternate assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| which is insufficient in teaching them how to modify content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| Then in January, Jason Myers presented a presentation to the board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| that outlined the beginnings of special education the KCS way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| It outlined KCS progress towards Chairwoman Henderson's resolution to make Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| a model district for excellence in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| He outlined several action items specifically requested in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| and labeled them special education the KCS way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| That included an RFP for technical assistance partner to access the state's special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| inform the development of a five-year strategic plan for special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| and provide programmatic support and other items like modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| During his remarks, Myers stated those RFPs for special education technical assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| will be out the week of January 8, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| However, it's March and the RFP is not out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| And the public has yet to receive a progress report on this item or any item from his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| So today, Chairwoman Henderson, I ask you to commit to a special education the KCS way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| Progress report as part of every monthly board work session agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| until all items from your resolution and Jason Myers' January 8th presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| to the board of education are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you, Tiffany.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| I'll ask if Warren Smith, did we find him? Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Did we find him? Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| While we wait on him, I think I saw Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I'll have Courtney Piper come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| Then after Courtney, just so people can move this way, is Melanie Fleury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| Courtney, if you'll state your name, kind of residence, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| It's okay. I can project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Courtney Piper, I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| I'm here today to talk about the private practitioner's policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| and hopefully resolve a lingering issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| That issue is KCS stating it has a policy against something when no such policy exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| Last month, I had a few email exchanges with KCS about allowing remote access supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| from a BCBA to the RBT providing ABA therapy to students with autism in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| The RBT spends the most time with the student in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| and is required to be supervised directly by a BCBA for a certain number of hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| For a number of reasons, sometimes this supervision needs to happen remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| I think it's important to emphasize this is not video recording and it is not recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| On February 22nd, the KCS health services supervisor sent an email to all approved ABA providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| stating KCS does not allow remote access anywhere on school property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| and attached the private practitioner's policy for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Prior to that, I had email exchanges with KCS employees who stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| the private practitioner's policy does not allow remote access supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| and private practitioners must adhere to school handbooks and rules unique to each school as well as privacy laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| Well, I read the private practitioner's policy again and a sample of school handbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Nothing in these documents prohibits remote access supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| or what is more commonly referred to as telehealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| And about privacy concerns, the private practitioner's policy states that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| practitioners must sign a confidentiality agreement and adhere to all applicable privacy laws like HIPAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| Remote access supervision does comply with HIPAA and FERPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Ask the providers how and they will walk you through the protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| Additionally, I find it odd that KCS told ABA providers that remote access is not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| but the school board executed contracts with McNabb and Harmony for telehealth services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| for in-person and virtual students both during class time and outside of class time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| Clearly, there is some existing KCS guidance on this matter that ABA providers can certify they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| I'm told the policy will go to board review but meanwhile services for some are in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| So here we are again. KCS says it has a policy against something when no such policy exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| At one point, that was KCS's position with ABA. Prior to that, it was a do not resuscitate order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| Then on the Compass Points podcast, I heard Commissioner Larson Jay say he had been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| KCS had a policy against paying for playground equipment and there was no such policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| So Superintendent Reiswick, I'm asking you today to initiate a zero-tolerance campaign at KCS for this practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| If your staff cannot locate a policy on paper that prohibits something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| that should be a cue to collaborate with parents on a solution instead of resisting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you, Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| Melanie. Melanie, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| Thank you. Melanie Flurry, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| As many of you may recall, this is my son, Elijah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| And to remind you, he is in the third grade in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| His IEP was well built and includes placement in the general education classroom with support from a one-to-one aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| I'm so nervous. I am here today because Elijah needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| His teachers need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| It's been six months since the board passed Madam Chair's resolution to make Knox County Schools a model district for excellence in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2889)|
| 0:48:19| This resolution was supposed to bring much needed solutions to a longstanding culture of resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| Once the resolution was passed, I, along with other special ed parents, breathed a hopeful sigh of relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| After all these months, we have not seen these changes you all publicly promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| We are still hearing teachers voice feelings of not being supported or saying during IEP meetings that they have not been trained in specific techniques or given certain materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2919)|
| 0:48:50| We have not seen any outside expert come in to assess our district's approach to inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| And we have not seen the culture of resistance soften whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| On September 7th, the board also publicly approved a contract for special education position backfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| What is the status on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| I am continually told that my son's team is extremely understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| In fact, they either take my son out of his gen ed classroom and group them together with special ed students in just one classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| or he misses out on recess or encore because they are understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| That is a direct violation of his IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| But let me ask you, if an ICU nurse doesn't complete his or her job and then says, sorry, I was understaffed, that's no consolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2973)|
| 0:49:43| And a teacher's job is just as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| They need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| It has been two months since Jason Myers gave a passionate speech with a detailed presentation on special education the KCS way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| which included an RFP for a partner to assess the state of special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| Myers stated that that RFP would be coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| However, it's March and it still has not come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| Not only that, but the public has not received a progress report on this item or anything that was mentioned in that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| So today, Madam Chair Henderson, I ask you to commit to a progress report that will be listed on every month board work session agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3016)|
| 0:50:25| so that not only the special ed parents, but the public can hear a progress report on the resolution that you have proposed and publicly approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3025)|
| 0:50:36| We need help. My son needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you, Melanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Alexis Rhodes, Alexis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| Alexis Rhodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| And if not, Alexis, Michelle, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| Michelle, if you state your name and county residents, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| My name is Michelle Meehan and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| My son, Max, is a second grader who receives special education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| I'm here tonight to comment on Miss Henderson's resolution to make Knox County Schools a model district for excellence in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| That was voted unanimously to adopt last September by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| I was truly excited when the BOE members committed to Miss Henderson's resolution, along with Dr. Reiswick and his staff's commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3095)|
| 0:51:44| Miss Henderson clarified that line item two of the resolution was written broadly with intent to bring in an outside inclusion expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| In November, Jason Myers said the request for proposal would be disclosed by January, possibly as late as February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| On January 8th, Mr. Myers also gave a presentation, the KCS Way Special Education, that included a request for a proposal to partner with an outside inclusion expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3121)|
| 0:52:13| It is March 7th, and we are still waiting for the RFP to be disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| Many parents, especially children, have said this is the number one item that is truly necessary to make KCS a model district for excellence in special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3138)|
| 0:52:29| which I hope everyone would agree that the resolution inherently means to follow the board's own special education policy following federal and state special education laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3149)|
| 0:52:43| Also, I would like to touch on teacher support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Currently, KCS has a handful of students on modified content who spend the majority of their day in the general education setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| When the district brings in an outside expert, just like with the blended preschool program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| the district will flip from a handful of kids in their true least restrictive environment to hundreds and hundreds of the kids in the gen ed setting with modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3180)|
| 0:53:10| It's a tsunami coming your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| In August, the Board of Education Work Session, Ms. Christie mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| one of the most significant deficit areas identified by both teachers and parents is the availability of resources to create modified content that allows students to access the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3197)|
| 0:53:28| After that comment, Mr. Myers shared that his team created a bank of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| The exemplars are 64 examples of modified standards for grades 3 through 8, which KCS spent $14,400 to create last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3213)|
| 0:53:43| There is also a presentation about do's and don'ts of modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| I have been in several Friends IEP meetings where general education teachers are responsible for modifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| They have not seen the exemplars, nor have they been offered any training on how to modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| It takes two and a half hours per subject, per week, per kit to modify appropriate for and experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| KCS's current practice is teachers do it on their planning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| That's not enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| We have solutions, curriculum materials prep time, which comes with additional funding, a modification support team similar to autism and support and vision services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| and eventually a large bank of modified content that will reduce the need for curriculum prep time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| Roberta Dennis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| Hi, Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| If you'll state your name and county residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3280)|
| 0:54:48| I'm kind of nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| Hello, my name is Roberta Dennis, and I have been a custodian at Knox County Schools for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3291)|
| 0:54:59| On behalf of my fellow custodians, I want to first thank the board and Dr. Roswick for the resolution supporting our rights as employees to speak on issues like our pay and working conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3299)|
| 0:55:20| Many of my coworkers have been afraid to voice their concerns because they are worried about retaliation, and I hope this resolution will give them confidence to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3320)|
| 0:55:41| Today, I want to talk about the important matter, the need for a fair and just wage increase for school custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3341)|
| 0:55:55| We are the backbone of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| We work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure a clean and safe and comfortable environment for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3359)|
| 0:56:12| It is time to recognize our contributions by providing us with a well-deserved pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3372)|
| 0:56:27| Custodians play a vital role in keeping our schools clean and orderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3387)|
| 0:56:36| We keep the schools and offices, the common areas, the classrooms, and other facilities in top-notch condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3396)|
| 0:56:51| Our efforts allow teachers, staff, and students to focus on teaching and learning without having to worry about cleanliness and hygiene in their surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3411)|
| 0:57:11| Despite the crucial nature of this work, it is disheartening to realize that our current pay does not reflect the true value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3431)|
| 0:57:26| Many of us face financial hardships as we strive to make ends meet on wages that may not be sufficient to cover the rising cost of living, especially in today's economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3446)|
| 0:57:44| We are hard-working individuals. We take pride in our work and deserve to be rewarded for our commitment to everyone's well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3464)|
| 0:58:15| I'm Joe Maddox. I'm from Knox County. I'm pastor of the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, and I'm also the co-president of the Justice Knox Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3495)|
| 0:58:27| We represent nearly 10,000 people, citizens in Knoxville, and we come from all nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3507)|
| 0:58:35| We're really here to applaud you, so when I finish, the applause is going to be for you. It's not going to be for my presentation, because my colleagues and I have come tonight to applaud you, Dr. Rosrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3515)|
| 0:58:52| And Ms. Henderson, we appreciate your request for a report about data following the public forum last month, and we appreciate Dr. Butler and Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3532)|
| 0:59:05| We appreciate your request to include the data that we were seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Dr. Rosrick and Ms. Lautner, we especially appreciate the report that you did on Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| It was an outstanding report, and we have actually distributed that information throughout our network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| We've distributed the meeting video and highlighted your report, as well as slides and conditions, additional data that you provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3563)|
| 0:59:33| We agree with your stated philosophy of discipline. It requires both high accountability and high respect, high support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3573)|
| 0:59:44| We also agree that the ultimate goal is student success, and I don't know of anyone who's not interested in the progress of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3584)|
| 0:59:56| We support the strategies that you have in place, especially through the control of the School Culture Department, directed by Ms. Janice Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3596)|
| 1:00:07| And we really appreciate what you shared with us about the work at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| We actually investigated Fulton's work in our research, and we have highlighted it in our campaign to change the picture of school discipline and ultimately student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3613)|
| 1:00:29| So we ask you again, Dr. Rosrick, to meet with us. We would like to share our thoughts about the consistent regular data reporting on this subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3629)|
| 1:00:40| and to discuss a potential addition of points that can give community confidence that you're serious about the change of the picture that the current data present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3640)|
| 1:00:53| We believe that most of you are serious about changing the picture, and we have the capacity to support, to build support through the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3653)|
| 1:01:04| So meeting with us would help us to build that support, Dr. Rosrick, and we want to help you and the board to continue this critical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3664)|
| 1:01:13| We applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you, Joe. I'm told that Alexis Rhodes is here. Alexis Rhodes came in. Very good. Did we get a hold of Warren Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3675)|
| 1:01:31| None of that? Okay, very good. Alexis, if you will state your name and county of residence, and you will have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3691)|
| 1:01:40| Alexis Rhodes, Knox County. Thank you. Traffic was awful. So nearly six months ago, I found myself standing here telling you all about how my six-year-old son only received six minutes of my time that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3700)|
| 1:01:53| I talked about how the special education task force clearly outlined a cultural resistance within Knox County schools, and I told you that this culture runs deep and is like a cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3713)|
| 1:02:05| infiltrating nearly every KCS central office employee I've interacted with. Let's just say that it's a good thing that you all are not oncologists, because it has been six months, and you continue to let that cancer spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3725)|
| 1:02:19| There is a difference, though. It would be unfair if I didn't point out that cancer doesn't discriminate, but Knox County schools does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| KCS continues to demonstrate that they prefer to allow a double standard to exist, one in which they care to ensure the lives of parents of non-disabled children are minimally inconvenienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3746)|
| 1:02:36| but cannot extend the simple respect to the parents of disabled students and those on their support team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3756)|
| 1:02:44| Sorry, I'm bothered by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| How so? Examples of this double standard are plentiful. At the music program I attended at A.L. Lotz last week, hundreds of what I'm hoping are the parents and families of students, though no one could be sure because not a single ID was checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3768)|
| 1:03:02| at the door or any other point recorded as our first graders sang along to Dolly. Some, again, what I'm hoping are families, even took the time to set up a tripod and to get the perfect recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3782)|
| 1:03:12| Nobody raised any concerns. There were no concerns during the school's Veterans Day parade when the man walking behind my son and husband smiled and recorded the event and the hundreds of students lining the hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3792)|
| 1:03:23| There was no concern when the onlookers recorded my son and countless other students at the annual Leopard Fun Run today. No concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3803)|
| 1:03:32| Yet when my son's ABA provider utilized remote access to observe and view in live time, not record his session, KCS is suddenly concerned for students' privacy and safety. May I remind you that the hundreds of recording onlookers within my son's school have never entered into an agreement with KCS to maintain student privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3812)|
| 1:03:51| However, BCBA is not only contractually obligated by KCS to maintain not just my son's but every student's privacy, she is also bound by far more strict ethical guidelines set forth by her licensing board as well as state and federal laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3831)|
| 1:04:05| So what's the difference? The difference is that my son's services are not as cute and fun as a bunch of six and seven-year-olds singing 9 to 5 or Rocky Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3845)|
| 1:04:13| The difference is that my son and his services aren't supported as much as our veterans and by the way my husband's 10 years on a submarine walk in the park compared to having a disabled student within Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3853)|
| 1:04:24| And the difference is that my son's services don't run around the parking lot to raise $40,000 for new playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| The difference is that there is a way to safely meet all students' needs and then there is the KCS way which still includes the culture of resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| Not much has changed in six months. I was tired six months ago and I'm still tired now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| But until my son's rights get prioritized over Knox County School employees' egos and budgets, I'll keep finding the energy and I'm not asking for the moon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3883)|
| 1:04:51| I'm simply asking that KCS offer the private practitioners they screen and approve a fraction of the latitude that KCS already offers the strangers that they allowed to record my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3891)|
| 1:05:02| Thank you, Alexis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| So our next two speakers are here to speak about some graphic images that were found in several of our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3910)|
| 1:05:19| All of you on the board actually were sent an email about the topic that contains some of those images that are found in some of our KCS middle and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3919)|
| 1:05:29| But that email was actually filtered and quarantined by KCS's email system, which is a bit concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| Dr. Reiswick and I have spoken about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| The folks that are here would rather actually find a solution than create a stir, which I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| And so Dr. Reiswick has some steps he is taking to address some of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| So rather than them speak, they're willing to listen to his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| I think he's also going to speak to something about the special ed and the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| But I will turn that over to to Ms. Henderson and Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| I just wanted to take a moment as the board chair to address some of the comments that were brought to my attention this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| In addition to numerous messages I received over the past week, I want to be clear that I firmly believe in academic freedom and texts that challenge us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| However, the books that have been brought to our attention this week are not challenging texts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| Parents have come to us with books that contain sexually explicit imagery, and that's not academic freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| That's inappropriate content for minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I don't think anyone up here would be for sexually explicit imagery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| Prior to this meeting, I independently verified that the books that were brought to our attention are indeed in our libraries for students to check out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=3998)|
| 1:06:47| And these books are paid for by taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| Dr. Reiswick, I truly appreciated your presentation on data this week, and your staff did a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| As chair, I'm requesting a similar presentation from you and your staff to present to us the current process to challenge a book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| the process of book selection, and any recommended changes you have going forward to avoid sexually explicit imagery in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4024)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| And I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| I think, you know, I understand, too, as a person, the concerns in our community around some of the materials in some of those books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| It's always difficult to define when you're looking at materials and media to define obscene and profane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| I know we've had long conversations with that, even with the law department, and that's not an easy definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| So it is a complex subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| As a father, I mean, I don't want my daughter to have access to that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| She's a Knox County student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| You know, but as an educator, as you've stated, I mean, I think part of exposure to diverse ideas and viewpoints is part of the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| and what we grow, but we do need to make sure that it's age appropriate, the things that they're exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| I also agree as an organization, you know, using taxpayer dollars to buy profane or obscene materials is not what those dollars are given to us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4081)|
| 1:08:11| I do want to point out, though, that our librarians under Sarah Searle's leadership, who does an incredible job, do a tremendous job every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| and they really work hard in that gray area that we're talking about to try to find books of interest to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| and really to try to build that love of reading for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| So I want to be clear that, you know, we applaud the work that they do to try to kind of walk that line and make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| And I would say, you know, we've talked a lot about spirit of continuous improvement in lots of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| We heard some of those tonight, and I would like to say something about the special ed in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| But I have Dr. Wilson and I have had some conversations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| I know he's talked with Ms. Searle's as well, and we would like to, to your point, bring something in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| I think those are the two areas I think that we're most vulnerable to and need to look at to make sure we're tight on our selection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| how that happens, making sure that we can bring, and if there's places we can improve that, that we can bring that to you all in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| And then also, how do we review our current process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| You know, there's things in place for that, but how do we make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| how can we be, to your point, transparent about that process so that folks understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| So we'll make sure, again, you guys who know Ms. Searle's know she's pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| And we want to get better, you know, and we want to be good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| So thank you for that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| We'll be ready in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Sherry and Sherry, do either of you want to speak or you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| You'll just wait and see what the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| That concludes public forum, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| Oh, yeah, he wanted to speak to the, sorry, the special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I apologize, I interrupted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| No, no, no, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| No, I do, I appreciate, and again, this has been a great process for us with the task force working with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| and this is why we wanted to have an ongoing task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| and I think that was part of the resolution that the board passed to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| You know, I know a lot of you all know Dr. Brown inherited or was forced into, no, I'm kidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| he's actually excited about it, the position, and I think that did delay us a little bit on the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| We did talk about this month being a month to do updates for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| I know Monday was a long night of updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| So he is prepared for next month to bring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And great questions, too, about the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| That is something that he and Dr. Loy have been working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| and they'll be able to update on that as far as where that is, too, as well as some other pieces to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| So I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Dr. Brown, but I wanted to say that is coming in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Yes, thank you, Dr. Roswick, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Yeah, so we discovered, as was shared with you all tonight, that the RFP has not been released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| I've actually been working with Dr. Loy and Cheryl Martin, who's in charge of federal programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| who works on many of those RFPs with county procurement to get that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| I will also say I've also asked her to see if there's an existing state contract so that we can expedite that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| because, as you all know, the RFP process can drag that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| We do want to get a third party in here as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| and continue that spirit of continuous improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| and making sure that we offer our students the best special education programs possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| And I guess since we're done with public forum, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Everybody have a great spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240307?start=4285)|
