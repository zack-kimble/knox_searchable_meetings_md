| 0:00:49| First of all, I want to welcome everyone to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| We welcome our guests that are here this evening, folks that are going to speak, and also those people that are part of the administration, part of the city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=52)|
| 0:01:01| So, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| This is the first time, I think, that we've done a workshop outside of the city and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=63)|
| 0:01:09| So, I hope all of you will take an opportunity to take a look at this building if you haven't done so, so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| Also, I would like to announce that we would like to give our condolences to Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| His mother has passed away and was unable to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| And in his place to welcome us to the facility is Aaron Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| Aaron, if you would like to take the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| Like I said, this building is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| Well, it was built in 1884.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| But to us, it's brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| We moved here from the city county building and from 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| And it's been a fantastic location for our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| It's also a fantastic place for public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| We've had soccer groups and community groups use the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| But it's our first public meeting, especially with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| So, we're happy to have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| I think all of you all were involved in the process over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| This complex has gone from 20 or so buildings to very few buildings and a lot of open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| And now there's some green work going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| So, I just want to thank the city council for their support over the years and continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| Moving forward with this complex as well as every other part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| We've got urban wilderness, which we just came from, really cutting the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| Crippled Walk Forest and all these different activities going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| So, we appreciate you all's support and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Everybody else, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| The restrooms are down the hall on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| There's a men's and women's restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I'll get some bottled water to have out here in the hallway for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| And we're actually also receiving our first award tonight from Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| This building is one of the fabulous 15 for our preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| So, we're heading down to the Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| But I hope you all have a wonderful evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| And Shanika is the girl out here at the reception area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| She can assist you all if you need anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Also, I want to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| In two weeks, we're having another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| A workshop on the reuse plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| And we're going to have that at the new Public Works facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| So, you'll get a chance to see it and review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| In a lot of ways, it's a lot easier for other folks to get to that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| So, that will be in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| With that, I want to just go ahead and jump right into the ordinance that we're going to reuse tonight, which is parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| We have Gerald Green, who's going to make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor Green, members of the council, members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| This is still the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| The city staff, NPC staff, have been working on this for some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| And I'd like to start just by acknowledging some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| The core group was Chris Cooper up here and Aaron, Chris Halley, and Joshua Parise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| The numerous other city and NPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Some of them are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Curtis Williams from the engineering department played a great role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| Jim Pegerman from the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| We were starting the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| I don't know where the initial draft came from, but that initial draft provided us some guidance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| We've changed a lot from that initial draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| The initial draft probably had 15 to 20 pages of landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| A full landscape ordinance within the parking ordinance would be not appropriate at that parking standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| It probably took 10 plus pages of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Those were lightened to the delight of some and to the chagrin of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| But trying to research something that would be a compromise and would meet the needs of the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| Many members of the community, some of whom are here, and I appreciate that because that gave me perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| and gave us as a core group of city and NPC staff guidance and moving forward with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| We had certain goals with this and it was to incorporate some current practices and standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| and provide more options for providing parking to reduce the land area devoted to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| I know we all have different opinions, but I see a lot of underutilized land that's provided for parking that's never used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| I'll provide some more examples later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| To reduce the stormwater and other impacts of impervious surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| To address issues related to the development and redevelopment throughout the city related to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| To enhance the safety of all users of the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| That includes the motorists as well as pedestrians who are traveling from their vehicle to the entrance of the commercial or other structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| And people who are walking from their home, walking through a parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| To improve the aesthetics of parking areas and provide consistent standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| I've talked to some of the council members and some of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| For example, our landscaping standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Now there's some in the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| There's separate ones in the C6 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| The planned commercial districts, the shopping center districts, the town center districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| The traditional neighborhood districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| It makes it difficult for developers to find all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| It makes it difficult for future ARN staff to enforce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| When someone on opposite sides of the street could have different landscaping standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| So we're trying to provide consistent standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| In terms of community involvement, we've had two community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| The first one in June and another one in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| The draft ordinance has been available consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| We've made updates on the MPC website since May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| We've had a public hearing at the MPC meeting on September 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| It was also discussed at the MPC agenda review meeting on September 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| We've had, as I said, numerous meetings with the members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Those meetings and conversations are ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| I think the latest ones were probably this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| And they will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| When I get to the next step, the next step is to continue to help council decide staff on this to receive public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=430)|
| 0:07:20| Reasons for updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| The national standards have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| I was at a ULI meeting in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| Urban Land Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| And a panel of the group listening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| They were talking about the commercial parking standards are 3 per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| We currently require 5 per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| So we're above the national standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Everyone's changing and we need to keep up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| We need to address the impacts of providing too much parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| It limits our development opportunities and potential within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| The stormwater impacts are significant with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| There's a challenge in redeveloping older areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| We have the areas on a request on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Or rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| Or rezoning property C2 that quite frankly should not have the C2 destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| To avoid the parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Expand the options for providing parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Now to provide just an overview of the updates and the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And I'm trying to get to high points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| I know you'll have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| There will be lots of opportunities for questions once we finish this brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| But there is overall a reduction in the required minimum number of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Peter Aarons and I worked quite a bit on trying to find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| Where is an appropriate median minimum number of parking spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| And we tried to address that while continuing to ensure that adequate parking is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| There is a provision for reducing below the stated minimum the number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| Upon provision of the parking study and approval of that parking study by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| The minimum number of parking spaces is below that set for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| We established a maximum number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| That's something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| We did that to address issues like my favorite example I'll show it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| Those angles on North Broadway which exceeds the minimum number of parking spaces by 48%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| And I drive by that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Some of you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| And I've never seen it more than a third goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| We need to encourage that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| There's also the example of Target at North Shore Town Center that is now marketing part of their parking area as a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| Approached us to see if it's okay to reduce their parking, number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| And it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Even the development community is beginning to realize that that paved surface that's unused is not appropriate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| The maximum number of parking spaces that can be exceeded by 20% just by providing that excess parking on impervious surfaces to address the stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=605)|
| 0:10:16| If you want to exceed beyond 20% it would require a parking study and that that excess parking be constructed on impervious surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=616)|
| 0:10:26| The access and dimensional standards have been updated with the current engineering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| Bicycle parking is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| There is a requirement for bicycle parking for everything except single family homes and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| We enhance the opportunities for shared and remote parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| We increase the distance that shared and remote parking can be away and address the issue of not allowing pedestrians to cross in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=646)|
| 0:10:56| For example, under the current ordinance, parking for flats and huts can't be provided on the other side of Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| Because of that provision that the pedestrian cannot cross in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| However, we would permit that under the proposed ordinance and the pedestrian crosswalk is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| There is a minimum five year lease required for that remote parking and that's in the remains consistent with the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=674)|
| 0:11:24| I wonder if you could stop someone from just pulling over and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| He just can't count the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| He can't count the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| But they can park wherever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Unless their meter expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Then they contribute to the city's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Again, it's the parking that can be counted when their plans are drawn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| There's consistent landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| We're providing some consistency as I stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| There's standards now throughout the ordinance providing them in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| There is a provision for alternative landscape compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| If you can't meet the standards, the developer, your design professional can propose something that's different that meets the intent of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=721)|
| 0:12:10| And that alternative landscape compliance is reviewed and approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| And there's another level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| If they can't meet the alternative landscape compliance and still feel that there's a parasitical standard or other hardship that would not enable them to meet the landscape requirements, there is a provision for appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=738)|
| 0:12:30| Accessible pedestrian walkways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Again, trying to make parking lots safe for all users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| It's to increase the safety of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| And also, there's a provision with regard to policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| We don't want this to be an excessive policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| And some of those, it's a should rather than a shall not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| We're trying to mirror the ADA standards for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Enhanced graphics in the ordinance to provide a better visual and indication of what we are requiring in the verbal standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=773)|
| 0:13:06| Just some of our challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Some of you may be more familiar with the photos in this area than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| But this is on Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| How do we address redevelopment of these buildings when there's no parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| The approach was to zone the C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Is unlimited height and intensity appropriate for this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| The mixed use building on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Is shared parking appropriate for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Where we know that the tenants won't be there when the offices are in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| And we're making provisions to make that easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| What should our parking lots look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Again, my favorite example is Doe's Angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| This is on Jackson Avenue on the right, showing basically a sea of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| Here's another approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| The slide on the left is something I pulled off the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| The one on the right is a photo across the street from Jackson Avenue from the sea of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| Showing the impact, just a little bit of landscaping you can have on a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| And the appearance of what I'm seeing in the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| This is, again, the Doe's Angle showing the existing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| And I apologize for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| The scanner wasn't quite as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| The one on the left shows the existing development with the enhanced landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| Most of the enhanced landscaping is along the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| If you look on the left side, that short cutout, that's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| More enhanced landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| The strike area on the left side of the parking area is the access parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| That would have to be permeating under the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| They could continue to exceed the maximum number, but it would have to be permeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| The slide on the right shows another development option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| And I haven't checked with DOT to see if they can get the two entrances off Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| But this shows them meeting the proposed parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Same size building, but doing it and still having a quarter acre of land available for other development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| And that's one of the things we want to promote, is how can we use our land more efficiently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| And it goes to a bigger philosophical question than just providing parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| But how can we allow Mr. Dill, for example, to look at a half acre land and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| instead of one building with parking for that, we put two buildings and do more intense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| because we don't need to provide that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| This is, and I apologize for the, I was trying to get it all fit on one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| but the differences between the current ordinance and the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And we can go over this if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| But again, I've tried to touch on most of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| The minimum spaces required in the reduced areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| We have a maximum number of spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| There are provisions for providing less than the minimum number currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| The only approach is providing or applying for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| And I think most of you got an email from someone today who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| those variances are handed out without meeting the requirements for a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| And we're trying to address that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| The remote parking, allowing it to be a greater distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Setbacks, currently the setbacks are for the parking areas of five feet from residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=985)|
| 0:16:35| 10 feet from the front of the street front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| We're proposing a range based on the intensity of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| For example, industrial districts, we have a parking setback of 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| office of commercial abutting residential 15 feet, multi-family abutting single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| or I guess 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Bicycle parking requirement, where it is currently there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| The shared parking is not directly addressed in our current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| There are provisions for shared parking in the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Pedestrian access is not addressed in our current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| It is addressed in our proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Again, trying to mirror the ADA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Requirements for divided medians, terminal islands, and interior islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| are currently required for blocks more than 20,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| The proposed draft has required parking for all parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| and greater specificity in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| We are looking at a proposed revision to that now to revise that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| based on the comments we received and the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| I'm not going to go into detail with the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| What we're trying to do with the proposed ordinance is take all those different standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and standardize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| They would be required for vehicular use areas more than five dozen square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| based on there is a proposed revision to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| It's in your council agenda packet for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| There is a 10-foot landscape strip required adjacent to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| for those parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| There was a comment about reducing that to five feet for smaller lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| and it appears that will work based on the research I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| and we'll have to state that the trees planted in that for the smaller lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| in that five-foot strip, or the small trees, not large trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| I don't think the large trees would spot in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| There's another 15-foot landscape strip when abutting a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| I think we all have seen what happens when you have a parking lot right next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| It's not a good neighbor, but abutting a 15-foot buffer strip with landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| seems to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| There are specific requirements in the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| and the parking for parking lots is imposed against break-directed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| As I said, I'll try to hit the highlights and go back quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| I didn't want to assume what questions you may have and try to answer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| before you ask them, but I'd be happy to answer any questions you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| and try to explain our thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Some of the questions, Krista Fugaro is here, Peter Ahrens is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Curtis Williams is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Again, the parking ordinance was not corrected by me in a dark corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| A lot of people sitting down, I don't know how many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| As staff, we put into this, so I appreciate the input of other city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| that made the ordinance a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Again, the comments from the public made it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| I hope, I keep thinking about a time in my career when we got a new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1184)|
| 0:19:53| adopted and the mayor told me that I was successful because everyone in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| it was a large, crowded room and said everyone in the room was mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| I hope that's not the case this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Can you raise your hand? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| First off, you talked about the national standards change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Was that empirically in terms of the use was not as much as people were setting aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| by standards or was that to reach environmental goals for runoff and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| What's driving that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| In other words, are these more or less pragmatic to what we're seeing in the field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| I think based on my conversations with people at the ULI and some commercial developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| it's their reduction in the number of parking spaces provided is based entirely on use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| If you look at the broader community, there are considerations of storm water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| the use of land, the cost of providing that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| That's a good major thing to put down to the 20-page memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Are you required to plant an old boundary or can you just mass it and let it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| How do you satisfy the requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| The basic requirement for proposing a parking lot over 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| would be to reduce the area to more than 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| That would be around all, for instance, some types of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| With an alternative landscape plan, we could do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| It's all within the intent of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| There's a provision for preservation of existing trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| so preserving existing trees located in one part of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| They can count on it for your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Are you going to have small spaces, islands in the middle of parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| that seem to cook trees and not really give them enough roof space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| and development space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Are you going to require enough breadth and width to allow them to thrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| and be mature trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| The minimum size for a landscape island or a terminal island is 120 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| which is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| And we note in the ordinance that we have a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| and that's for each row of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| So if you have a double row where parking is two cars hit on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| you would need a terminal island for each row, 120 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| or 240 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| The reason for those terminal islands is more to direct traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| within the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And that, the terminal island requirement, is in the existing ordinance also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| We're just being more clear with regard to the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| and the landscaping requirements of the island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| You know, I've talked about the administrative review panel, how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| and is that in place now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| So I want to talk a little bit about how to appeal for an area for a review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| on the alternative to the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| I'm going to start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| And Peter may—I may call on Peter to enhance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| because I think I've been to the administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| That committee is composed of staff from various city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| They were—currently their major role is reviewing plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| within the four districts, the South Waterfront, the Pembaland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| to review and design the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| What we tried to do, instead of creating another staff committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| to review those requests for alternative landscape compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| using the existing panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| And if Peter wants to fill in, I'd be happy to allow him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| It's a pretty all-inclusive board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Everyone from engineering, MPC, KGB, Casey Krause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| all the commissioners on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| So the goal is to have a very inclusive committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| so that it's not assigned to one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| It has worked well in the four districts where if an issue comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| it's not just one person that interjects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| but it's actually good deliberations when issues are brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| So are the decisions of that committee are going to be appealable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| or is that the final place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| That's the final, unless you want to go to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| I'm going to say one of the other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| In the four districts, there's other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| but in this circumstance, this application would be in the field of ECA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| In that context, if someone picked bare trees for the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| do you help steer them to better choices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| We would rely on Casey, her enforcer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| to identify and appropriate species or herbicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| If I could also, with regard to that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| one of the provisions that's recommended based on follow-up comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| is that a reference to the city's list of recommended species| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| is maintained on the city's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| So our first step would be to refer the developer or design professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| to that list of recommended species,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| and that list is maintained just across the urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| For example, the Sam's Club expansion that happened about a year and a half ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| in East Knoxville, where they spent $8 million on a really nice expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| they planted a bunch of river birch in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| It's hot and dry, and I'm thinking this is a riverine species| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| that wants to be on a bank or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I don't know why they think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| They planted a whole bunch of trees in the first batch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| and put in some, I don't know, some irrigation so they could kill the second batch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Someone could pick a better tree from a little bit of the sea and let it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Unless you've got a full discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| We might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| So, Gerald, the park, is it one ordinance, the parking ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| and the landscaping ordinance, or is it combined, or is it separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| What's your problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Within the parking ordinance now, there are landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| There are specific parking blocks there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| and I've talked with some members of council and some members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| about the need, and with Lisa Krause of the city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| also about the need for a more comprehensive landscaping ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| to address a number of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| What we're trying to do is chip away at the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| and since we're updating the parking ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| and as I stated, there are, within our current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| there are standards for landscaping and parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| We're trying to put those in one place and make them more consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| realizing that as part of the comprehensive update of the city zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| we will address a more comprehensive approach to landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| We've heard a number of comments about the need to address maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| by bonding a number of things that are more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| to a more comprehensive landscaping ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| They're responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| If this is a maintenance issue, they're responsible for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| not just for the installation, but the installation for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| So if I want to find out if I use this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| I mean, the real estate office particularly has a real demand on parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| that probably will exceed the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Should I want it to exceed the maximum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Is that appealable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| I mean, I can get 20% more with a parking bystander line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| I can get 20% more than the maximum allowable with a parking bystander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| If I want to go beyond that, is that appealable or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| What we're proposing is that if you want to go beyond that 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| then you present a parking study showing a demand for a parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| And that parking study would be reviewed and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| by the engineering department with the opportunity for input from the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| If for some reason that parking study were determined to be inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| or not justifying that parking and you wanted to appeal the denial...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| So is the parking study just a letter from a civil engineer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| Is it just my opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| I mean, what is a parking study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| That's the question that we ask in our staff deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| And to be honest, we're not able to answer completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| And I'm not going to throw this one to Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| although if it gets too difficult, I'll mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| What we're looking at is something that would state the number of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| for example, real estate agents that you have on duty at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| the number of people that would be coming in to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Give an example of a closing that might be held at your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| the number of people that would be attending that closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| plus your staff and their clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| and show that you may anticipate 100 people in your office at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| but only have 80 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| So that has to be prepared by a conventional parking study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| We're talking about a TMI plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Here's my reasoning for the justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And if Curtis or anyone differs with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| what we're looking for is something that we believe justifies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| We all agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| And the city staff very often justifies that need for additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| We're not looking for some engineering study or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| but something that we can point to and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| this document or this information justifies an additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| But an existing facility, like, for example, your own building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| wouldn't even come under the standard, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| You'd have to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| We'll talk about that. Talk about what tricks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| It's a remodeling or a reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| I'm going to start, and then I'm going to return to Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| because I don't want to miss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| But if you're doing improvements that exceed 50% of the assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| of your office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| you would have to come in and apply the parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| And this is a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| I'm not clear myself, so I'll leave this one for Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| If you're doing renovations to your existing office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| and you're not expanding the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| do you need to do anything to the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| because you already need the parking space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| That's a question I would leave for Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Is it money or is it physical space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Is it physical space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| And I'm not clear enough with the standards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| The administration didn't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| If you're expanding the parking lot, working in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| if you have 100 spaces and you decide to add 20 spaces to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| only those 20 would have to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| But if you decide to add 60 more spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| and you've exceeded the expansion limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| that's more than 50% of your space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| than the entire parking lot would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| So if I'm going to repurpose a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| and the improvements exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| half of the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| then I have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| I'm not sure on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| So that's why I direct that to Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| because I'm not sure on the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| He'd like to call a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| So if you repurpose your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and the cost of construction exceeds 50% of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| and the lot assessed value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| that will trigger updating your parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| He said appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| It says assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| It says assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| So it's cost and not physical space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Same square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| It depends on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So what about that in a different place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| If the cost of the renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| exceed 50% of the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| you will have to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| with the current more proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Here at C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| we know we will rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| because we have no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Because there is no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Because there is no parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| on any of those pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=1984)|
| 0:33:22| I have seen complaints about the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| that we can build student housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| without having one car per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| and the idea that it's totally impractical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| to assume that students are going to automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| ride a bike, get on the bus, and walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| The experience is that one car per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| is probably realistic and I think you have a fraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| I don't know whether that's the .67| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| or some other number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| If you look at page 723| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| multi dwelling structures, housing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| renting by bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| .67 per bedroom minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| 1.2 per bedroom maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| That question was raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| and I was just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| most people probably have a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| because you don't just walk to your classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| you have to get to your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| or visit mom or go shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| and I didn't know if that was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| I mean it almost looks like it's designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| to force more use of public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| to discourage cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| it's like a policy objective rather than a realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| usage thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| so the question was raised by Mr. McCord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| he said we're going to end up with a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| built in parking garages after the dust settles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| because people have built accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| that don't accommodate the cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| that are going to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| It's hard to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I'm not sure what the question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Why not one per bedroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| The council can certainly direct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| but what we're providing is a range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| from basically .67 to 2.3 vehicles per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| up to 1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| and providing some latitude for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| the developer cannot provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| or does not provide adequate parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| especially seeing the number of student housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| under way or planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| there's going to be a lot of competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| that the developer has to latitude there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| others may have pushed for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| my daughter was 21 before she got driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| and did not have a car in college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| because she chose to spend my money on something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| and a lot of them are pure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| if you look at National Friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| pure young people are driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| we're trying to provide that range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| for the developer but also providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| the latitude for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| in one location they may decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| two-thirds of the vehicle per bedroom is adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| in another they may decide 1.2 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| the .2 per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| one every five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| we're not saying you have to do the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| we're saying here's the minimum, here's the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| you have a range there, you can even go above the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| what we're seeing with most of the new student housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| is that the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| the structured parking in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| these standards do not address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| obstructed parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| some of these standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| not the minimum, maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| but the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Gerald, was there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| in terms of the parking stalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| the distance and this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| the 45 degree versus the 90 degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| was there any look in terms of changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| any of those dimensions from the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I know we worked through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| a number of times on the engineering standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| but I would prefer to be quite honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| I took their expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| and the dimensions of the angles of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| so I'll defer to Curtis or Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| looking at the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| and the containment condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| I think for the most part we kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| in the zoning ordinance right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| within this range that we presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| for the various cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| if you go to page 11 of 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| there's a table 3 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| but that's what I was asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| well with the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| we didn't have a range like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| we just had a value, a single value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| for instance, 45 degree parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| the stall depth to wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| in the current zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| is 16.5 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| and the length to wall on this one is 16.5 to 20.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| so we, instead of specifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| one number, we brought a range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| that's why I was asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| we're getting a couple of parking lots and parking situations now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| it seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| cars are getting shorter instead of longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| I was just wondering whether or not that's being looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| from the standpoint of our parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| do we have 40% for compact cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| allow for 40% for compact cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I really appreciate Curtis being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| he's in a difficult position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| because Chris Howley actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| did most of the work on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Chris heard about this workshop a week ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| but again, I think the key thing to take from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| is currently there's one standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| engineering standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| now there's a range to try to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| if you think your customers or residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| are going to have those shorter cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| they can go with the minimum of this range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| if they're all going to drive the Dual East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| well I just wondered because we had the range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| but again, our smallest is what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| and that's why I was asking the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| is it larger than the existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| well I think the existing is 45 degrees I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| 16.5 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| so what we're saying on this is 16.5 to 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| that's what I'm asking the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| what I'm seeing is the bases are going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| that's true, the intent was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| close a loophole if somebody wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| well I just have a minimum so I'll just extend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and create more of a sea of asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| so we want to have it on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| and create that range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| and then allow for reduced sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| with the compact parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| because not everybody's buying new cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| I know with parking garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| usually most of the developers make them as small as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| so you've got a shoehorned car in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| it's expensive to go park in the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| is it $10,000 a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| you're not going for the high side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| any other questions or comments from the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| Ms. Malone sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| I think she didn't use the word but it's kind of squishy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| if it's more creative or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| it was kind of a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| I'm looking at 22 or 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| the African vision is a more creative means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| to meet the spirit and intent of these requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| it sounds encouraging that you solve the problem a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| she indicated how do you enforce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| or how do you make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| it seems standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| I think it's in her comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| maybe there should be a couple of examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| the tough thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| we wanted to encourage creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| challenges on a slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| that may limit the ability to meet the strict standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| of the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| you put standards in and you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| the alternative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| the alternative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| as described by Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| contains a lot of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| look closely at these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| what we're relying on is the expertise of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| engineering, public work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| land review, MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| the urban forester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| look at this and say this meets the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| the description from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| the design professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| this is how I met the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| we don't want to shoehorn someone into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| because not every spot is perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| it's like a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| you go to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| the idea is you've got professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| I'm familiar with a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| that has done this for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| and it's resulted in some outstanding design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| because there is a review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and it allows a design professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| to do what they do best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| to design and be creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| you can look at a site that may have some constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| maybe there's a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| we don't want to limit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| I think the question stemmed from the enforcement side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| it really is a discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| I guess a discretionary tool to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| and say yeah, if you did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| it would actually have a better appearance or better stormwater impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| that was the question I wanted to relay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| so we could discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Gerald, there's one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| I know you sent a memo to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| talking about some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| in the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| it would help me if I had a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| of the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| and where you were making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| we did some red lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| I don't know if the whole thing has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| if I can give you more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| than you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| we made lots of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| but I'll at least go back to the more recent graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| and bring you up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| that would be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| we do have a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| at our discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| we've seen comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| too much landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2717)|

| 0:45:26| he pitched everybody off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| we do have several people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| we will do the 5 minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| and so we will start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| we will start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2741)|

| 0:47:21| Our company's been in business since 1939,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| a generation in this, and I've been in it for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| and what we're known for are these particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Now, there's other areas and other genres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| that probably could be addressed by people in that field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| I'm much better than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| so I'm looking at what's reasonable and actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| with market demand in these particular categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Number one was the multifamily structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| that Bill Hogan talked about just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| Essentially, the potential, what I saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| I only saw there was 2.5 parts per welding unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| and what I get concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| and I understand that 10 bar rods is a very important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| like, for example, Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| there could be more walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| but we're seeing these spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| to over there behind the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| and they're also starting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| you can see in the paper recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| senior development site is where they put four bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| into development and have a common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| and those individuals are deadly more often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| when you have cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| so I think that the minimum and maximums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| the minimum, I think, is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| and I understand what the chair was trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| with the coach angles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| which probably doesn't need that much parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| but I'm gonna try to get on areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| where I think the standards are too low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| and they're gonna cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| impede development and cost on other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| I'm not-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| The maxes are too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Yes, the minimums seem to be fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| the maximums are too low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| in the categories I'm gonna discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| For example, the convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| and that was item number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| and it was suggested four apartments for a thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| We've worked with Pilot, BP, Exxon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Wigle, I've been around 60 convenience stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| and multiple Wigle stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Mr. Wigle, who I think is the most prolific convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| guy probably in the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| and it's an honor to have him in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| and what he's done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| You know, he's become higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| he's no longer just a convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| he incorporates restaurants and fast food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| and his new product line is 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| and 50 parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| So that's, you know, 1,010 for 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| So that's a quite good variance in parking ratios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| and then, but that is standard in that industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| That industry is no longer just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| come in, get a candy bar, go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| There's people eating in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| there's people getting sandwiches in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| you can see Pilot and the likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| And you're the one of the big franchise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| eat in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| with the subways and gongs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| So there's people actually going into these places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| and eating, and those proponents need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| The next one I want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| is the retail sales and the shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Excuse me, Albert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| you're saying that for the convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| with gas, you're saying that it is too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| Now see, there have been so many pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| that have been sent to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| The last iteration of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| I had four parts for 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Now you're saying that it's too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| And then, what is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| hey, and what I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| that Mr. Fogger's own property is 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| So what I'm saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| eight is a bit small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| and 10 is a more appropriate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| That's what I'm getting at, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Retail, there's so many numbers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| guys, I'm trying to hit this in a five minute time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| but I'm trying to hit this as quickly as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| In the retail sales and the shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| for example, we represent hundreds of tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| on the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| and it's 4.5 per 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Yes, that's number 29 on the take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| That is not a consistent number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| They're actually, when they send their tenant requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| they will request five parts per 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| And the other issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| with the new shopping centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| and we're involved with 13 in this area right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| just the soft good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| with just retails involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| is no longer the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Most often involve two or three restaurants at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| depending on the end caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| which require 10 to 12 parts per 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| So that is gross to max,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| and that is grossly under where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| And I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| parking issues like in Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| they've had terrible tenancy issues out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| because several of those centers have been under park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| and then the crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| and they park on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| and they cause problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| and that needs to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| from the standpoint of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| We're doing one right now here in Goldwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| and down at Cheryl Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| and both of those are 10.2 per 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| I think that's a more appropriate number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| especially if you're gonna have a battle center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| that's got food, soft goods, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Five minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| I've had several others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| and I can send out some more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| I'm gonna ask that we give him a few more minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| I just had three more to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| In the restaurants and pool service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| what we're seeing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| and I think Gerald made a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| relative to Bojangles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| you know, they probably don't use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| but on the other side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| we have Chick-fil-A, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| The more popular restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Cheddar's, Cheesecake Factory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Bravo, P.F. Chang's, Wasabi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| they've been higher parking ratios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| because they're very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Those are more than 18 parks per thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| and so I don't think that we should punish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| those type of restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| with the construction permit service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| until they get to 18 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Now, obviously, if you can build less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| and you know you're not gonna fire it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I can tell you as a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| if you think you can get away with three parks per thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| for your particular use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| you're not gonna build 18 parks per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| You're gonna go to the minimum, not the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| but there are, like Cheddar's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| and you can go by Cheddar's or Chick-fil-A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| and you'll see that every parking space is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| So we call those the grillers in the industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| and that's the one we have to trim off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| because they're the most popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| for our general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| but they're going to these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| So that's one of the problems with these restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| And then, relative to the fast food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| as Gerald was saying earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| it would be the same issues that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Chick-fil-A is a prime example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| You can see the parking, they found the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Kingston Park, that's where I'm living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Kingston Park right now, down to the other location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Emory, all of them are completely packed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| in that particular genre of the restaurant business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Last one, which we're very involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| is the medical development business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Right now, it says five percent parks per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| What's the maximum that we have with Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| What do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| 35, 35?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| No, 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| We represent GIA, Knox-Darn, some medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| and some of the bigger specialists and practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| Seven is not an appropriate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| In fact, GIA, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| over in Weishaufer, where I originally lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| they were having to bus 45 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| They were five, five per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| So I think that number probably should be pushed up to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| because it's not conducive to more large practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| and large specialists that require much more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| You have to invest more dollars in dermatology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| and have a lot of practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I think that it would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| This is my last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Well, I was just gonna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| if you would get the latest copy of table one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| and then go ahead and mark up and give that to Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| We're good with the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| But also, go ahead and talk to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| The very last one was the general office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I talked with Justin Kazama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| He's probably the most political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| office representation company in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| It used to be, when I started this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| 30 years ago, four was a very appropriate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| But because of the extensive office space now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| what's happening is people are putting more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| into more than five areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| which, of course, increases the amount of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Whereas I used to see four parks per thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| that's not an appropriate number anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| It's more like seven or eight per thousand now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| because of the way things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| You can go into downtown and look at the open area offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| and they've got the school room packed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| So I think that number is almost half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| of where it probably should be on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Okay, if you will take table one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| And get it to that big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I thank y'all for allowing me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| We're very interested in seeing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| We've been here for almost eight years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| We want to see it continue on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| So thank you, and we hope that you can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| to me with City Council and with Carol and Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| We absolutely appreciate your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Carl Cozzi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Carl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I live at 328 Fulton Street, Seymour, New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| And our family owns some properties here in New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| not just here, but most of the property in West Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| I want to speak mostly about the landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| One thing landscaping is gonna do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| which trees and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| especially for very small apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| it's gonna really cut down on the percentage of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| The other thing is that it's gonna be blocking the views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| in and out of the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| It's about not even standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| the federal highway safety standards for sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| You do have a requirement there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| that trees be trimmed seven feet above ground height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| That's good for small automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| That's not meeting buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| To meet the minimum for school buses or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| that height has to be a minimum of 14 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| What, we had 10 feet, did we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I thought it was seven, maybe it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| I read seven at one time, maybe it's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| It's below 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| The other issue is you've got trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| you're saying you can plant them within 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| of the telephone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Can you be brochure-safe if you have to plant 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| from the minimum of 10 feet from the utility model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| The size of trees you're wanting to plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| they're saying 40 to 50 feet from the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| because the ground's gonna come out into the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| The other thing I see involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| two brochures from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| parking lot inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| One thing you mentioned is the traffic route system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| that you're gonna put in a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| the stretch you're gonna put on a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| and the difficulty of the tree growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| in a parking lot like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| While I was downtown last week at another meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| I walked around downtown, photographed several trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| The city's made a real effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| to put the trees in downtown lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| When you go around, several of them are stressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| they're dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| The section in front of Division 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| where there's five trees there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| every one of them has a number of dead limbs on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| These limbs are gonna fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| they're gonna get the best of you as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| The other thing is these trees drop fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| These trees are dropping leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| and something I discovered when I was downtown last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| engineering, the city has put tar paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| or felt paper, over a lot of the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| to keep the leaves out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| While we have the storm drains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| we're covering up things to keep the leaves out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| and now you want us to put more of these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| They put some out when we're repaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| to keep the stuff out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Well, they also have a problem with leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| The other thing is these tree roots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| have destroyed the storm drains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| drain bases, especially the old ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| that are built out of bricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| 30 years ago, the city was forcing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| to cut these trees to make the side triangle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| and also to keep them out of storm sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| So we're gonna have a lot of damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| You can walk around town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| you can see a number of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| where the sidewalk is lifted up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| and there's no longer any maintenance damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| And these are issues that you're gonna force on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| as property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| And right now we're in a drought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| To maintain trees like this in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| you're gonna have to have a tremendous amount of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| And if you cut water off right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| such as Maryland and some of the other cities have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| these trees are gonna die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| That's a problem we're having in California now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| And the biggest thing is, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| the trees are gonna be dropping fruit and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| on the automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| People are not wanting to park in a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| that has something dropping on their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| especially pine trees, pine logs and stuff like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| And like I said, I've sent you the brochures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| both from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| I did not send one from K&V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| but it is online at K&V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| and there are requirements for planting trees from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| The big issue is, it's gonna be unsustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| And right now even the city has difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| sustaining their trees downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| A number of them have been replaced several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| You can walk around town, you can see them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| they're diseased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| And some places, where you have them really long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| shading a lot of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| and if you look at some of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| you've got black mold growing on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| growing on some of the street plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| That's out next to the Eastern City Historic Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| The other issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| you're making this kind of an extra residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| assuming this is what residents want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| When you build in there, you're gonna block their sunlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| If they're growing a garden, if they have anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| we're still gonna have sunlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| That brings me back to another issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| is we're doing all this mostly to block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| glaring light at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| This is something the city has never addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| and that is the light pool issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| We do all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| but we don't do anything to correct the light pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and I think we've got to start with that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| before we move into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| building everything else to block it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| That's all I've got for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Mr. Boothay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Tim, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Tim Hill, 311 South Wyatt Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| You're in the community, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| One of the things that I would like to really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| I've got a lot to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| critical items, and then items that are worthy of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| and I think the most critical component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| of this parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| has to do with the landscape requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| and I don't have nearly as much to talk about tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| because I want to give credit to Gerald and Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| They've done a great job listing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| and we've had several meetings with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| We have kind of brought some of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| to real-life experiences for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| and they've responded to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| so I think I just want to give them credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| The current landscape ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| starts at 20,000 square feet of parking use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| This, I think, was, we've had several revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| It got as little as 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| back up to 10, and now we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| somewhat of a hybrid where at under 20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| you won't have, you won't be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| to put in interior or perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| But you would be potentially faced with the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| on the under 20,000 width front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| at, we talked about 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| I think Gerald is looking at five feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| which I think is a practical approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| When you look at small parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| five feet is very critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| and I can give you a number of examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| up and down this Kingston Park here in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Anthropology, a little bit around the mortgage investor group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Pizzeria, nothing but cakes, and many more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| but those are just right there in the same block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| that you can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| So I think Gerald has been very pragmatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| very practical-minded when we brought these to his attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| and so given the assumption that we're gonna be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| at five feet frontage and then no perimeter or internal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| I think this is a pretty practical-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| landscape ordinance, as we're talking about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| There was also, we brought up an issue about shared access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| and again, they responded with taking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| the perimeter landscaping when you shared access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| We have a car wash in Briggs Pizza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| which is now West Hills Lights and Past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| They share access, so they responded, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| appropriately by saying, okay, that wouldn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| We're gonna eliminate that, so a good revision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| Moving on from the landscape ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| because I think it is a reasonable ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| as we have discussed it, the outdoor seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| in the current ordinance, I couldn't find anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| where they counted parking spots for outdoor seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| So if I'm in error there, please correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Peter, I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Okay, and this restaurant has a courtyard that you eat in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| So in the new ordinance, you're penalized basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| or have to provide more parking with outdoor seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and I just, I believe that with the seasonality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| and it's more of an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| I think we like to sit inside or out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| more than adding capacity to a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I think we would like to see the outdoor seating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| not counted as parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| We're all about less parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| We would like to see no parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| So please take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| Also, shared parking, the city requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| a memorandum, basically you have to put it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| what's the correct term, in the deed, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| So that cloud style, there's complications with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| You have banks that you would have to approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| and get permission before you could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| if you had a mortgage on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| That is in the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| So the new ordinance is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| I don't have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| I just thought we might want to consider a parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| a revocable parking license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| We've had it with a number of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Goodwill, we have a revocable parking license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| where we can use their parking to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| our restaurant that has in-house pizza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| and mortgage investment approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| We have it down in Earthshare where we have a two-spark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| a four-and-four-spark boulevard in Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| The current ordinance says that you must have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| a memorandum for five years, but if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| a 20-year lease, are you any better off having it in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| I just, property owners are more apt to cooperate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| if it's not clouding the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| And so if there's discussion where it's in the deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I bet you if you haven't had an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| then you would put a memorandum of that lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4057)|
| 1:07:37| It has to be recorded, so it has to be recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| So the memorandum of the deed, it clouds the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Yes, thank you very much, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| Parker, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Parker, state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Parker, Caldwell Union, 311 South Wise Harbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Try not to go back and get some of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| that the previous speakers had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| So I'm gonna focus on some of the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| of this permit's payment, and also some examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| of what I think has been good development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| that would not meet the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| So permit's payment costs about two, three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| what normal payment costs, and so the increased landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| or the maxims that are now being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| would increase the cost of development dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| on the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| And so what that's gonna do is the smaller developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| will experience the greatest impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| So the increase up to 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| from what it's proposed at will eliminate the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| it has on these smaller parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| And that's done right now in our stormwater requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| Stormwater requirements are much lower on parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| that are less than an acre, although we increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| the per waste area by half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| And it's done, for one of those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| is because those smaller parcels are absorbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| just an extraordinary impact on their size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| The other thing that it will do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| so when tenants are given this option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| to either go over the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| because they have their standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| whether it's boat jangles, I know that I can't beat up on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| I actually met with them down in Atlanta this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| and talked specifically about why they require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| as much parking as they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| And this is a national requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| It's not something that they come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| just an obstacle or just some barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| But they've said, we need that much parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| You might think that they might be wrong or right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I don't know, but they have, I think they're up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| 476 restaurants right now around the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And they say, this is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| So what's going to happen is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4200)|
| 1:10:00| the larger national tenants will decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| we're going to either eat the cost of the pervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| or what we're going to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| we're going to just not come to an obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| So they're going to eat the cost and comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| or they're just not going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Why does it cost so much more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Why does it cost so much more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| Put a bunch of rock out there and then pervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Yeah, well, some of the technical aspects are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| you have to dig down lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| produce, put gravel underneath the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| the asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4230)|
| 1:10:30| So it's a lot more labor intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Well, it's more material and more labor intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| because then you're talking about either a concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| that's pervious, so it's designed that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| and asphalt's cheaper than concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| And then the type of pervious asphalt is more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| than the type of pervious concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| is more expensive than regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Or you go to pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| And pavers is where we're going to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| And then originally, pavers were laid by hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| They now have machines that can lay 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| by 10 feet squared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| And so the industry is beginning to catch up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| and adapt, but it's still the cost of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| And to address the swarm water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| and that's what the pervious does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| we as developers don't go out and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| a big retention basin because we want to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| go build a big retention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| And what we do to offset that retention basin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| is we look at the cost of pervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| We would much rather put pervious in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| if it was cost effective and go build a retention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| But the costs still at this point are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| go build a retention basin because the pervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| is so much more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| We look at pervious on almost every single development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| that we do, and the cost does not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| And that's usually the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| that current tenants want or require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| So, but the impact on the smaller tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| so these are not the big nationals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| but these are the small ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| These are the ones that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| 70 to 80% of the businesses in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| are local restaurants, local small business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| They are gonna be less likely to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| to absorb these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| They're just starting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| They don't have the capital that the big boys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| They don't have the financing capacity that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| And so they're not gonna be able to handle these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| And when we're talking about Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| where we're getting rent rates that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| highest in town, you know, it's somewhat easier to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| just increase the rent, just increase the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| But where this is gonna really impact this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| is in the areas that are not Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| So you're talking Broadway, Chatman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Magnolia Corridor, and these are the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| where I think we need to encourage investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| encourage growth, encourage taking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| the numerous car lots and turn them into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| And those are the areas that are really gonna be hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| by some of these proposed ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| Real quick, if I can have just 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I wanna highlight some properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| that would not meet these codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| The MCV at Kingston Pipe and North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| the Tizikis, an American family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| CVS, Kingston Pipe and North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Chewley's, Carolina Hale House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| the Aldi in Bearden, Chick-fil-A in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| and probably the most town is the Whole Foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Whole Foods Shopping Center is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| I think, an amazing shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Has a ton of landscaping compared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| what we're seeing at other developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| The amount of trees that we're asking to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| between the shopping center and the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Whole Foods wouldn't qualify for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| And so what we're really talking about here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| how can we be more of a green city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| How can we move towards these better ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| When you look at Whole Foods and you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Whole Foods doesn't qualify for what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| we're really making a massive jump here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| from where we are currently to where we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| And I think that we need to really evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| some of these existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And some of these ones that we look at and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| you know what, that's a good property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| And just, are we going too far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Are we asking too much right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Because the process and how we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| where we're trying to go to and where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| we really need to think that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| Because if it's gonna take the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| being what Paper Mill Plaza was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| which was a vacant big box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| or a wholesale furniture store for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| I don't think we want to force that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| the Magnolia Corridor or the Broadway Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| to where our land values increase so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| that we can then justify just tearing down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| the whole building and starting over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| We need to be able to improve these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| incrementally and keep them for what they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| before their values drop completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| Just a clarification on the Whole Foods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| did you calculate that after we revised the street tree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Because the street perimeter buffer standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| proposed ordinance is the same as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| in the current SC zoning, or C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| which is what Whole Foods is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| It's 10 feet and three trees per 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| It's the same in our latest revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| as it is in the current SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Whole Foods is the front end along Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| The only thing I looked at Whole Foods was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| the number of trees, because it was the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| kind of a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I didn't look at it for purpose-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| because it doesn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| And I didn't look at it for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I'll check with you with our current...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| So along Paper Mill, there's 16 trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| and it's 800 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| It would require 20 trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| So it's 33% short, even on existing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| Parker, if you would, if you give him the examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| that you gave him, I'd like to see the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I think the way that the existing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| The difference in the existing proposed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| you're allowed to plunk those trees along the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| and not right in front of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| And that would be a second plunking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Joyce Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| Hi, my name is Joyce Bell, 1540 Adelaide, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And I'm here with two hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| I'm going to represent two different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| One is Scenic Knoxville, which I know you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| and the other one is relatively new organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| called Streets Knoxville, and the mission of Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| is to improve the aesthetics of our public spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| and trees, Knoxville, as to grow and preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| the urban forest public and private land in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| And we, both of these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| strongly support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| We think it's badly needed, and we applaud it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| We are delighted with the reduction in asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and with the increase in the landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| And I want to say, I think we would strongly oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| any dilution of the existing landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| that are in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| Trees add tremendous value to a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| And just off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| trees provide shade, which promotes walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| They cool the ambient temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| We've all known this through a very hot summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| They cool the ambient temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| They reduce air conditioning costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| for residents and commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| They reduce storm water runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| and promote ground absorption of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| which helps with our drought conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| They reduce air pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| They increase property values, commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| Research has shown that shoppers stay longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| in developments that have trees that are attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| and therefore they shop more and buy more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| And trees greatly enhance the aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| of our public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Other cities have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| We're behind on greening our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| and making it more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| So when somebody gets up here and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| it's not possible to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| I know that it is because I know that other cities do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| So we support the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| The only change that we would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| in terms of the landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| are in earlier drafts, there were height requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| for some of the trees in the perimeter buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| and also in the landscaping pylons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| I can't cite you where the early statistics were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| I think there was a feeling that in terms of enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| that information was gonna be hard to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| but added to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| as a result of the NPC meeting last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| was the requirement that trees be selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| from a list of recommended trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| compiled by the city tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| And that list already includes information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| about heights at maturity for the trees on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| So an inspector's gonna have to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| what species of tree is planted there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| to know whether it comes from the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| and it's just as easy to check and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| that it then meets the minimum height requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| So that's what I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| and I'm so happy to address this, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Joyce, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| David, you have a commissioning address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I'm David Williams from Rayburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| I'm with the 505 College of Goddard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| and you've also probably said very similarly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| son of my great-granddad's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| I just want to give a brief overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| of how folks in Coggett feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| We have a good working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| between our residents and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| and we just don't want to see that relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| stifled by a new regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Mr. Green touched on something very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| and I wish you would really continue on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Have the neighborhoods work with the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| We don't want every business to look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| It's just like my great-grandmother, my grandmother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| and my mother didn't plant all the same flowers in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| They were a variety, and I believe this helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| the sales business and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I don't like all the corners to look the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| so I don't want all the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| to look the same landscape and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Sometimes the landscape in front of the building is nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| sometimes no landscaping is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| And speaking of landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| if you come to my great-granddad's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| there's enough landscaping for every single business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| So that's our overview of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Don't stifle the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| Let us work with the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| I'm going to read another thing for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| You can't put downtown in the same group as Coggett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| So Mr. Green, if you expand on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| limit the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Let's not have this be a landscaping workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| versus a parking workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I don't know of any business that would want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| and do something ugly to deter customers away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| The business person would want easy access and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| They want enough parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| And I'll tell you a pun again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| we don't have a problem with too much parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| We have so many businesses, and we actually need more parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| but we're working with the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| and those businesses provide parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| We've talked about it with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| we've talked about it with engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| we've talked about it with the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| but I think we're coming up with some solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| that really help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4909)|
| 1:21:49| So really have the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| be a big part of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| You're trying to do it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Council, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| This is why they've signed us off the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Any comments from the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Are we going to hear one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| You ain't really going to write to the general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| No, I mean, next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| two meetings then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Oh, two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Two meetings then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| All right, thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161103lakeshoreparkingordinance?start=4943)|
