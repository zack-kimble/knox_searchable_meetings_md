| 0:02:52| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Any items to be withdrawn from tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| 12A, I'm going to move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Senior's property freeze for senior's property tax freeze for senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| There are some local governments across the state who have instituted it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| I think we need a little time to find out how it's working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| It's a good idea, but let's take what other people have done and learn from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| So I'm going to propose to postpone this for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Postponing for eight weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay, postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Yes, this has to do with moving something in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Would this be the appropriate time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Item number 9A, which deals with the electronic message centers in a planned development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| Some of the interested parties cannot be here right away and ask that this be moved to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| And I believe that everybody that's interested is amenable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| So I'd like to move 9A to the very end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| I guess I don't know if I'd hate to move it to the end and have people show up since we're starting so late to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| Mr. Greve is swearing in Eagle Scouts tonight, and it was at his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| And Mr. Seymour was agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| No, it's not the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| I'd hate to move this to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| We're not postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| You're just moving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Do you want to move it, like, halfway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Yeah, I want to move it not as far down in the agenda because, frankly, a lot of the stuff on the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| I don't know that anybody's here for, and I'd hate everybody waiting while we do a lot of other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Well, how about at the end of the resolutions before ordinances on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| And then if everyone is still not here, then we can move it again at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| We'd move it to after 11N, but before 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| I think Mr. Greve had just commented to me that he thought it could be here after 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| So I had no idea what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| Why don't we move it until then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| And if we need to bump it back, we'll do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| So the request is to move 9A to follow the resolutions before taking up the items in number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=309)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| That was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Oh, actually, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Ms. Holk was starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=334)|
| 0:05:34| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| I'd like to add item number 11N to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| 11N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| All those in favor of adding 11N, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=349)|

| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| And consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I don't think we have any tonight, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Item 6A is an application for renewal of a certificate of compliance for Everett, Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=361)|

| 0:06:20| If I could, as we move into the other part of mayor's report, I'd like to ask Gary Norman to come down here to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| You know, it is awfully nice when one of your city officials gets recognized by people outside for being outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| And it's a privilege for me to announce that Gary has been named the building official of the year by East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| Building Officials Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| There's about 300 members of that association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| They represent cities and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| And obviously, when your peers and folks who do what you do recognize your excellence, it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| And obviously, we want to congratulate you and also thank you for the good light that you shed on us by receiving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| award and by doing such great work, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| That's a huge honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| I know your wife came with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| I think I see her back there, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| We really appreciate the great work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| The man of few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Gary, that was a chance for you to give a speech right there, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| Gary is one of those people that solves problems, doesn't just identify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| But I greatly, since he's come into that position, he has done a great job of, like I said, taking care of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| and solving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| And we're very grateful for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Okay, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| It's a big time in the city, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| First Friday, the first Friday of the spring, first Friday, was back last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| And it was a great week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Everybody that was downtown saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Downtown was packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| And despite the work down on the 100 block, it's holding up well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Great crowds down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| It was really a fun night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| So thank you, and hopefully a lot of you all had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Dogwood Arts Festival is obviously kicking off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| and I hope everybody can participate in as many of those events as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| The first sundown in the city is this Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| A local band, Dishwater Blonde, will open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| And the main act is a Grammy Award winning group, Arrested Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| One other announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Some of you all have been already to one of the brown bag, green book luncheons that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| I think there was one last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| And this month, Elizabeth Eason, architect, is leading a discussion of cradle to cradle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| remaking the way that we make things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Elizabeth is one of the members of our Energy and Sustainability Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| She also serves on Governor Bredesen's Energy Policy Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| It's at noon at the Chamber Market House room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| And I think the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Oh, it's tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| That's tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| So make to that if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| And I think that is all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I have actually a report of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| M&A is the annual report for the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I don't know if you're making a report to Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| If you'd come forward, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=555)|
| 0:09:25| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| I'm Bill Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I'm the current chairperson of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| And we appreciate this opportunity to present our annual report for 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| We have a couple of members with me here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Ola Blackman-McBride and Reverend John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Reverend Butler joined PARC, was appointed to PARC last year, and Ola, I believe, the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| And I appreciate their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| And also, we'd like to remind you and ask our Executive Director, Avis Reed, and her Executive Assistant, Lisa Chambers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=594)|
| 0:10:02| to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Avis has been very proactive in meeting with neighborhood groups and individuals who are interested in increased police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| presence and also in helping them resolve any differences and improve their relationships with the Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Department this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| We also appreciate the oversight of Tank Strickland, Commissioner Strickland, and the Director of Community Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| And we, as you all do, pray for his continued recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| I think from the annual report, which you have before you, it's pretty much self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| I think the most noteworthy thing I see in there is that between 2007 and 2008, there was a 38 percent decline in the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=640)|
| 0:10:50| issues, complaints that were reviewed by PARC, which indicates that there's been an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| Although statistics are misleading, can be misleading, that would indicate to me that there's been a continued improvement in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| the relationship between KPD and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| And I think there are a number of things that contribute to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Community involvement in our meetings in different parts of the city this year has been excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| We've had a lot of citizens be at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| And I think in large part, we can thank our community leaders, and particularly religious leaders, where we often meet, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| encouraging attendance of not only the people that belong to their groups, but others who are interested in either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| resolving issues or who have questions about policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| And also, the KPD, the chiefs, the command staff, internal affairs, have great attendance at all of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=707)|
| 0:12:00| And they are open to discuss particularly problems, questions, issues that have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=720)|
| 0:12:09| and explain what a lot of their policies are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| And I think you can see from things that happened last week, there are things that happen that there are policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| and procedures that are in the interest of officer safety that are sometimes understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| And it helps to have an open dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| And these meetings have served a great purpose by having the presence of the KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| and particularly the command staff there, and their willingness to meet with people individually after and explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| And I think it's been a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| And lastly, I'd like to thank the mayor and the council and city government for establishing an open dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| and a lot of different innovations that have encouraged people to communicate their problems and issues to government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I'd be happy to answer any questions or refer them to Avis if they're difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Any questions for Bill or for Avis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Let me just say, we very much appreciate the service of the members of the board of PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| And I know the others that are here and some that can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| But we realize that you're doing this just out of concern for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I think PARC has made a huge difference in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| And we really appreciate you all being advocates for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| I'm going to back up before I go to anything from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| And I want to ask Madeline Rojero to give us an update on the plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| If you could, Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Council members, prior to the meeting, I handed out the draft annual plan for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| We're going to talk about this at your workshop next Thursday, the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| This is the plan that we do every year that shows how we're going to fund, how we're going to utilize our CDBG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| our home, and our emergency shelter grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| We're in the middle of the public comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| We had a press release, and this plan is posted on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| In the memo that I gave you, it also lists the other locations where the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| in the community can get a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| We are seeking public comment on our proposed plan, and that public comment period will last up until April 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| We have a public meeting scheduled on Tuesday, April 14th in the community room at the Kanzler YMCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| where we invite people to come and also provide public comments about this proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| And we will have it on your agenda on, what's that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| April 21st, I guess, is when the next council meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| Also, at the April 14th public workshop, we will be seeking comments on the use of the stimulus funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| the CDBG funds we will be getting, about $504,000, and on the Homeless Prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| and Rapid Rehousing Program, which we're getting about $771,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| We actually have an RFP out right now to the homeless service providers for the homeless funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| and that's due in on the 13th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| And we'll be bringing that plan to you at your May, your first May, I guess it's May 5th meeting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| So there's several things coming up, and I know it gets confusing, but it's explained in this memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| And as you're reading it, if you have any questions, I encourage you to call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| particularly if you have particular things that you would like us to discuss at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Anything you want to give us a heads up on, we'll make sure that we're prepared to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Thanks. Any questions for Madeline on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Now, any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Ms. Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| I just kind of want to follow up on what a wonderful week last week was in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| and to mention that something that I had hoped to announce, but we had to change the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| because the gazebo at West Hills Park is so very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| So we had an Easter egg hunt that we had to kind of rush up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| I mention it simply because it was such a great time to see young families that were new to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| bring their children and get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| So that's just the kind of idea to toss out there for neighborhoods that are fortunate enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| to have a park nearby and to take the opportunity to use one of the city parks for an Easter egg hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| These kiddos were so cute and so excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| They were a little afraid of the big Easter bunny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| So I don't know who was in that suit, but that was a little intimidating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| But I just want to suggest that because it's amazing how fast a year flies by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| and it's time to plan something for a neighborhood or for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And we just want to thank you again, Joe, Walsh, wherever you are, for the wonderful job you all do in our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| and getting them ready for the spring season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| I wanted to share something with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I handed out a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Everybody should have gotten this on convenience voting that I'm planning to put on the next agenda for Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| sort of to make it official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I want to thank Hubert Smith for sort of raising this issue and at least getting me to think about this is sort of a new model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| that the Election Commission here has gotten approval to do a pilot project this fall in a new way of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| And my sense is I'd like for us to have decided if we're doing this or not doing it by the filing deadline for the fall election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| which is in the middle of June, which is a little more than two months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| And I know this council well enough to know that two months is not a long time for us to make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| We like to discuss things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| We want to think them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| So I wanted to hand this out and get it on people's minds now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1095)|

| 0:20:54| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I'll just, we all were through this discussion two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I'll just say I'm going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I think it's something we already can do, and anybody is quite able to do what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| So I don't know that we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| On the other hand, it doesn't do any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Councilman Becker, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| The reason I did it is because obviously there were Councilmembers or a Councilmember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| wanted to do it and do it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And we also heard that if not anything else, it was symbolic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| So I'm just trying to allow them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1292)|

| 0:21:34| I'll be recusing myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Again, I mentioned that two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| I choose not to have Councilmember Community Improvement Funds allocated to my discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| And so I think it would be appropriate that I recuse myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1307)|

| 0:21:55| or is this just taking it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| You make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| This is up to the individual Councilmember to signify in writing to the City Recorder's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| Office that they want their funds to be turned back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1325)|

| 0:22:16| But here again, I feel these funds are so helpful to some groups that would be hurting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| if they were not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I think they're very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1346)|

| 0:25:48| Mr. Botes represents them and will be speaking in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| The original application was for C3 and neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| MPC staff recommended neighborhood commercial and C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| and the applicant concurs with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| That means that before any building could occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| the applicant would have to go back to the MPC and apply for a use-on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| for a neighborhood commercial store, i.e., a Dollar General store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| which comes under the classification of a dry goods store in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| The Dollar General store, which is the proposed user for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| is a small neighborhood store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| This store would be 9,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Actually, it's 9,035 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| They keep limited hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| They are not a 24-hour-a-day store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| They are a limited traffic store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Typically, even with employees, there will be 100 cars in a good location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| which Dollar General feels this would be, coming to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| Since it is a neighborhood store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| the traffic generation for John Sevier should be no additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| since everybody would be coming from the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| There is already commercial in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| There is a Weigel store a short distance away at the intersection of Merrill Pike and John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| There is a car lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| There is another sort of drive-through cigarette store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| There are commercial activities at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| Mr. Hall has his office there and has had for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| This is one of the lots that he bought when he bought this property, and it is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| He sees this as a very good use for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| and one that would not adversely impact the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| A question has been raised about what the church's position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| The Church Airhead Church has a letter in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| in which it states it was opposed to the C-3 originally requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| but is basically not opposed to the C-1 recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| The other adjoining property owner is Mr. Hall himself, and he can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| I'm not sure anybody who might speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I assume there will be, even though none are signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| are not immediate residents of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Their concern would be traffic and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| And I do not think the nature of a neighborhood store is one that would adversely impact traffic in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1728)|
| 0:28:58| So our request is that you grant the appeal by Mrs. Loveday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| and grant the neighborhood commercial plan amendment for this one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| and grant C-1 zoning for this one acre on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| If I may, I'll let Mr. Motes make his statement right now and then Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| Now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Ms. Loveday would like to ask a question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Mr. Seymour, I understand you to say that the ordinance that we have in front of us would need to be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| because it indicates that your client is appealing for this general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| It should be for C-1, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Well, we're on the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Okay, at that appropriate juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Sure. Hi, my name is Greg Motes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| I represent the developer for Dollar General, the Broadway Group, and I live in Huntsville, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| It's an honor to be here tonight, talk to you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| I don't know that I can shed any great light on it, but I will tell you that for the past six or seven months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| that we have negotiated in good faith with the seller and the local neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| and I think we've addressed just about every objection that's come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| So we've gone through the traffic issues, and I will tell you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| as Mr. Seymour said, on average, during the weekdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| the store would expect to have anywhere from 80 to 100 cars in and out of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| Between the hours of 12 and 1, or 11 and 1, it's a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| and in the afternoon, it's not as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| On the weekends, that's a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Of course, the traffic flow is probably not as great, but 120 to 140 cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| so nothing significant, anywhere from 8 to 12 cars per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| We are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| We're the largest developer of Dollar General stores in the country, and we focus primarily on the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| We take care of stores or build stores in Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| and we think this is a great community for a Dollar General store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| We look at the demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Dollar General has already approved the area or given us approval with these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| Obviously, if we can go forward, they would love to be in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| We will employ local employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| I'll tell you, I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I'll be the project manager on this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| I am the senior project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| I'll tell you, I'll be on site, and from the time we start digging with a shovel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| until we actually open the doors, only about 45 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| so there's not a big disruption to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| It's not a large building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| As Mr. Seymour said, about 9,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| so we're not going to have a lot of cranes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| We probably won't have more than six or eight subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| total people, on site at any one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| I'm here tonight to represent the builder and developer and Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| and I'll be glad to answer any questions if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Any questions right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Then I guess Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| John Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I live at 7201 Sherwood Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| I'm the investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I'm the one selling the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| In 2003, we bought this property from a group of doctors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| and it was zoned for office complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| And we went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| We're a franchisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| My business is At Work Franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| We franchise throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So one of the reasons we wanted to be in South Knoxville was for the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| We have a lot of guests coming in from all 50 states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| and we fly them in and they come over to our complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| It's never a traffic issue, and we don't worry about waggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| We don't worry about the cigar store down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| We just bring folks in and show them South Knoxville and what it's all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| and what our business model is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| When we bought this property, there was two adjacent lots on both sides of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Our building is about 12,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| We don't use all of it right now, but we're growing into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| But the real reason we wanted it was for the airport and for the reason to bring people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| So when we bought the property, there were these two extra lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and we said, well, what are we going to do with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| And we said, well, we're not going to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Let's just put them up for sale, and maybe we'll sell them one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| We didn't even think about the zoning when we bought it because it was already zoned for offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| And I don't know if you guys ever drive out on the highway out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| you'll notice, Governor John Sevier, it's not really a make-up for offices complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| It's a make-up for the local community to do some shopping at waggles, get your gas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| And if you drive over on the Chapman Highway, you can do all your shopping over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| So when we bought the property, really wasn't really interested in selling it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| But as time went on, we started getting people to come by and talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| and basically, we haven't had anybody wanting to build office complexes out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| I don't know why, but they just don't want to build our offices out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So we decided we'd look for some guys who want to invest into it, and we said, okay, retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| And the dollar store folks come to us, and we thought that would be a good partner for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| in our neighborhood to work with because we just don't want anyone next to our office complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| that we have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| We're there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| We see the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| We see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| So we just don't want to sell that property to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| So we made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Okay, let's get someone to work with that will be a good promotion for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| So we said dollar store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| So there we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| We went out to sell the property, and we didn't think it would be a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| But the zoning, I'm not used to zoning, so I don't know all these complex things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| that you guys go through every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I see you on TV, and I'll stay here, and I wonder how you guys do all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| But I just want to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| I just want a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| That's all I'm looking for is a good neighbor to come in and be in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| and help the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| So, yes, probably down the road, we'll probably sell the two-and-a-half acres beside of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Now, we may be back again telling you about we need that rezoned for retail because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| really think when we bought the property, we just knew it was for an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| and we didn't even think about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| It was already zoned for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| So we didn't think about, well, what if we want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| We want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| So I guess that's how we got here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| So we're just asking to develop for retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Like I said, I just don't visualize having a lot of, quote, offices built out on that highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| It just doesn't kind of fit the normal situation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| It's a good retail location for the local folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| So I guess that's what I have to say about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Any questions there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Is there anyone that would like to speak against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| My name is Mike Brown, 7320 Twin Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| I apologize to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| I'm used to commission where we don't have to sign up beforehand and we're not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| So, Arthur, that's why I didn't want to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| I knew he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| We've only known each other for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| I feel like I need to give you a little bit of a background in this community before you make a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| I'm not going to take all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Back in about 1974, myself and a few neighbors got together and decided we didn't like what was happening to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2167)|
| 0:36:18| Now, that sounds crazy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| But we saw a lot of the haphazard development going in out there, which seemingly had no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2180)|
| 0:36:29| So we decided, well, we need to do something because one of these days they're going to be coming south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| We need to be working on a plan that the community likes, the community can live with, and we started from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| This homeowners group has been active since that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| We would have had a whole lot more people here tonight, but this is our homeowners night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and we have two other county issues coming up tonight that are going to be discussed at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| We do have some of our folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| But from that point on, when they first started, the first sector plan we worked on was Mike Harberry back in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| We've worked on every sector plan since, had input, worked with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| We've had up and over 200 people at a meeting and planning for our community and through these sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2233)|
| 0:37:21| because that's what we believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| And we believe if we make a plan, we need to stick with the plan unless there's an emergency situation comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| Now, our plan is due to be reviewed this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And I can assure you, Mr. Donaldson, we will be there with bells on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| having some input into what goes into this revised sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| We were instrumental in getting the designation of Scenic Highway for John Superior Highway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| We felt like we needed to maintain, keep and maintain a traffic-moving highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| We don't have any traffic-moving highways that skirt this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| The closest thing we've got is Middlebrook Pike and you've got to get downtown first before you can get on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| When I was on MPC, this is one of the things that we did when they did that restructuring of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| The main focus was keep this a traffic-moving road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| To do that, you have to keep egress and egress off, you know, limited as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| As far as commercial development is concerned, we've identified 11, maybe 12 commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| already zoned commercial between Alcoa Highway and Chapman Highway that are not being used now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| So why, just because one is available, does it mean that we have to zone another piece commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| This little lot, it's a little skinny lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| It's going to be very difficult to put a store in there with adequate parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| I understand they approached the church there next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| And our information is that the church is against them using their parking lot because they asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| I just want to kind of give you a little bit of a background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| We have one person who's going to give you a little bit more details on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| But I want to let you know where we came from and why we're at this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and why we are here tonight to try to maintain what we feel like is best for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Commissioner, just to clarify, you are opposed to C1 as well as C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| This is one more thing, Carson, before you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| This particular piece happens to be, if you have a map there, I'm not sure whether you all get the maps or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| that's the last piece in the city if you're coming east off of Alcoa Highway on Johnsonville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| That's the last city piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| And what piece next door is county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| So we're not used to coming before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| We're used to coming before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Could you give us your name and address, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Yes, Carson Daly, 7508 Government Farm Road, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| And, Mr. Seymour, I am a lifelong resident of South Knoxville, along with some other members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| You made a comment that the opposition don't even live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Yes, we do live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Let's keep our distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| He said adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| But we do live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Part of this sector plan that we are discussing was South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| As Mr. Brown had said, South Knoxville came together at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Not only one or two people showed up, but many people showed up for this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| Our last sector plan meeting, we had the South Doha Band Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Well over 150 to 200 people were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| And I wish you were to be there because we do love South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| We're not opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| This part of the sector plan was approved at that time that there would be offices there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| The section that they're talking about, the car lot, part of it is a legal zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| That's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| We'll discuss that with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Part of it is the Grandfather Den.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Part of that car lot was at one time was a garage building business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Sold out, now it's a car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| So that was Grandfather Den.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| The Weigels, the drive-thru convenience store, those were all planned commercials through the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| As long as the intersections, as Mr. Brown said, you need egress from side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2485)|
| 0:41:35| And these are from side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| This is not a main entrance on Governor John Spear Highway, which is now a three-lane highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| which the middle lane now, if you're driven on John Spear Highway now, is a passing lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| So you do have a passing lane on John Spear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| This is going to make it dangerous for people, for customers, and I do go to Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| I go there before I go to a Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| You know, they're a Tennessee company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| But this is part of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Let me read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| The sector plan was adopted by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Not you members there, but it was city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| The south sector plan approved by the city council says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| To protect and enhance the scenic character of the Governor John Spear Corridor as a bi-scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2539)|
| 0:42:29| Limit commercial to only designated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| Petition the state for further restrictions on development along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| And mandates that develop along the ridges or the edges of the corridor be severely limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| and include increased setbacks, reduced signage, and limits of the intensity of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2569)|
| 0:43:01| We're not really against an office complex being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And I'm sorry that the gentleman bought the property not knowing what the zoning was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| But this is a sector plan that we in South Knoxville worked hard to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| We're opposed to this commercial at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| As Mr. Brennan said, there are 11 partials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Just up the street beside the drive-thru tobacco store, which is really a convenience store there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| there are partials there that has access to John Spear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| We won't have to worry about heavy trucks coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| So I'm asking you to take a look at this sector plan and uphold this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| The South Knoxville Area Homeowners Association, we tried to protect this highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| We're the ones who come up and do the adopt the roads and to make sure that the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| that the developers are within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| And fortunately for the county commission, they have held this sector plan as a sacred part of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| It might have been said that it is part of a, I can't say that it's a law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| but it's really a Bible that you should go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| And we ask that you take consideration of the sector plan and leave this zone office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| and let the Dollar General Store just go 300 yards up the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| and there's plenty of commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Mr. Seymour, I guess you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| I think there might be one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Is there someone else that wants to speak against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Please come down and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| My name is Charles Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I'm 1821 John Sphere Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| We've said so far most of what I had to say has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| But there's one thing that you really need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| John Sphere Highway is a two-lane highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| And the speed limit on John Sphere Highway is 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| There's not a car or truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Half the traffic are tractor-trailer trucks that travel from Asheville Highway to Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| And they're also traveling at 60 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| And if you pull out of my driveway, you better hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| And if you're pulling, if, anyway, the traffic is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| And I don't see that the only traffic light on John Sphere Highway is at Mark Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| And that's only because the school buses cross at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| The rest of it, there's no traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| The road actually just moves traffic back and forth from John Sphere to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2736)|
| 0:45:46| There's also no retail dry goods type stores on John Sphere Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| The only stores we have are the Wigo's type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| And they're at a major intersection and only in those spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| Anyway, it's pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| The parking on this little site is not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| They will have to rent spaces from other folks if they choose to go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Mr. Seymour, you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| The issue of variances or inadequate parking has come up two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Mr. Moat's group has reviewed the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| They've had preliminary engineering work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| They can meet all of the city's requirements for on-site parking on this one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| They do not need parking from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| They do not need any variances for this store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Traffic keeps being brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| And you can say, well, let's stop building anything on John Sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| No offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Offices, in a lot of instances, can generate more traffic than commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| Homes, a lot of times, a subdivision certainly can generate a lot more traffic than a commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2828)|
| 0:47:17| If you have enough homes clustered there, the traffic will be locally generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| It will not, people do not drive across town to shop at Dollar General Store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| nor do they drive across town to shop at Weigel's, which is already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| nor do they drive across town to shop at Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| These are typical neighborhood stores that cater only to subdivisions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| And it's certainly appropriate at this node to have a small neighborhood commercial store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| like what is being proposed by Mr. Hall and Mr. Moat's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| And it is compatible with his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| He's got over 25 people working in his office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| And that number is growing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| If you figure that's two trips a day in and out, and that is just in the morning and the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| and, of course, most of the employees there would also go to lunch also off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2895)|
| 0:48:23| So his business, if it continues to grow, will generate as much traffic as a Dollar General Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| So that's certainly not an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Now, let's stick to a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Well, that's good, and it can be bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| If we enact plans that cannot be changed when circumstances change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| we'll constrict the city in the future and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| This is, as MPC has noted, an appropriate place for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| And we ask that you all grant the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| approve neighborhood commercial for this site, and C1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Mr. Donaldson, I am usually in favor of the least intense zoning for a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2950)|
| 0:49:19| particularly that's adjacent to office or neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| that is for which the suggested use can be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| And my question is, can a neighborhood store like this be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| or be given permission with a use on review process in the office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| that the property currently holds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| But let me double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2984)|
| 0:49:57| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| May I have just a moment to rebut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Let's wait one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Actually, I don't think that's appropriate at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Later, somebody from council can call on you if they would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| But let's finish this original question and then we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| In the O1 office district, there are no commercial or retail uses allowed as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3013)|
| 0:50:23| There are, however, all of the uses that are allowed in the R2 zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| which is our multi-dwelling apartment zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| So for this particular, the person interested in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| would have to have a higher intensity zone to accomplish that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Mr. Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Well, I noticed that Commissioner Brown wanted to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| and I just wanted to hear what he had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Mr. Brown, if you'd come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Commissioner Brown, if you'd come back to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Thank you, Mr. Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Just two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| One is a safety issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| If you have a map or if you're familiar with that intersection at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| it's grown from a country place to a zoo right at that intersection there with O'Marable Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3068)|
| 0:51:18| You have two outlets onto John Sevier Highway there that, by all rights, need to be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| because they have a new cloverleaf around which would alleviate some of that traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| but working with the state to get that done is almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| It is a safety hazard right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| The road narrows down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| While it was mentioned a minute ago that it is now a three-lane supposed turn lane in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| right there where it crosses O'Marable Pike, there's a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| And, of course, you know what happens when they come to a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| It can narrow us back down to two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| So all of a sudden you're going along there and all of a sudden, whoop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I don't have another lane here anymore to turn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| So the safety issue there is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| It's one we are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| The second issue that Mr. Seymour brought up I'd like to address is we're constantly against change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| We're not constantly against change, but we're constantly against change just for the sake of changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| If you can change it and make it better, that's why we've been working for 30-odd years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| to make our community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| We've had a lot of changes in our community, but we've worked together on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| worked out our issues, and we believe that we have a working community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| and we would like to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| I guess a comment and then a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I'm very worried about the traffic related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| It does not seem like an appropriate zoning because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| And it's more than just, I mean, Mr. Seymour says, well, you know, an office in there could create as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| The question I want to ask Mr. Donaldson is a bigger picture question about John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| I have from some past discussions at City Council, I still carry the Knoxville-Knox County major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| wonderful discussions about other roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| John Sevier is classified as a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| so a big road designed for moving traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| And in the little one-paragraph description of what a major arterial says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| or what a major arterial is, it says access control is desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| which to me means we want to limit the number of driveways, the number of connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| the number of places people are getting onto and off this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| And I'm wondering, do we have anything limiting access to John Sevier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| And if Mr. Green knows that, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| I always call you Mr. Green. I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Well, to answer your question, I don't know where the legal document is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| but this road goes right through the middle of my family's farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| three-quarters of a mile from the location Mr. Hall has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| And we were told from this one in there that it would be a limited-access highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| If you had so many feet of road frames, you could have one entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| or if you had so many feet, you could have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| It was supposed to have been totally a limited-access highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| but we've gotten away from it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Well, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cain, do you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| are there limits on driveway access to this road because it's a major arterial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| Yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Well, there are limitations on driveways in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| or it's based on the zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Also, depending on which section of Johnsonville you're on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| whether you're in the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| there would be permitting through the city or the county and or through TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| And is there an ability for people to say, no, there are too many driveways here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| TDOT can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Or let me see the question a little broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Why do we allow driveways at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I mean, this is a major connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I think the commissioner spoke really well about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| This is a covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| Well, and Kingston Pike has problems because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| I mean, it strikes me that we ought to be moving towards many fewer driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| on a major arterial, not, I mean, major, many fewer driveways on a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| With all due respect, we need to have it be recognized by a councilperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| And maybe, who's your question to, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Was there a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| I guess since he's standing there, I'll ask the commissioner that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Everyone would deny a fellow elected official the ability to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| Well, you asked why the additional driveways have been allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| If you have a piece of property, you cannot be denied access to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| And as families have, mom and pop died, family, you know, property has been divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| Part of this property there on that road, my mom sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| And there are now two egresses into that that were not there before because it is two different pieces of property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| So that's the biggest reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| When property is sold, you can't deny them access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| May I point out just one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Out of fairness, I'd like to recognize Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| This store would use an existing commercial driveway into Mr. Hall's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| There would not be an additional curb cut on John's sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| How can it be a commercial driveway when it's not commercial property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Office driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Other questions from members of council or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| I have on my computer a copy of the regional mobility plan 2034 that the TPO has been showing through public meetings around the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3407)|
| 0:56:59| And under roadway projects 2024, it identifies the proposed upgrade of the west leg of John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3419)|
| 0:57:09| meaning the portion from Alcoa Highway to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| And, of course, that upgrade would be four or five laning, you know, to give it additional capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| But we're looking that far out at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| And I think all council knows, given the way transportation funding is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| with cost going up much faster than revenues, everything's in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| So is it likely to happen sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| Maybe, but probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Is it likely that it could happen later, even in 2024?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| It's certainly a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| So, in the meantime, I think we need to be very cognizant of what we do with a resource like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3468)|
| 0:57:57| Mr. Seymour said plans are not set in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| Well, Mr. Seymour's job, I appreciate it, I respect him, but Mr. Seymour's job is to argue that for every client he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| who wants to do anything, anywhere, who will write him a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| And that's his job, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| But the other side of that coin is that plans have a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| He's right in that plans can't be set in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I agree with him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| But they have a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| And if we say, okay, any time anybody wants to change it, then the plan loses its value and meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| And I can say, even though only a small portion of my district is on Governor John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| I see it as a very valuable asset connecting different parts of the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| of the city of Knoxville, of Knox County, and of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| And as was pointed out, it's also a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| and the intent has been to keep commercial development off of it, as was stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| except for at major intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| So far, for the most part, successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| And I think it should be, I would hope that this council would agree with that intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| and with the history that's transpired so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| most of which has been overseen by the county government and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| And I'm just thankful that we've been as successful as we have so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| in protecting Governor John Sevier Highway and that important asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| So I would urge council to join me in denying this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| I will make it a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| There's a motion to second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Mayor, I was going to see if Mr. Seavor wanted to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| Well, traffic seems to be the focus of the issue out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| and that's why you put a neighborhood store in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| That's why you use an existing driveway for an entrance into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| Something's going to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Apartments, more office, or neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| which Dollar General has identified as a need in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| So, basically, what you're doing is deciding at this point, well, we don't want commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| We want more office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| We want more apartments there, which we can go ahead and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| but we think it's an ideal situation to develop a smaller store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Otherwise, you're going across town to a Walmart over to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| or you can go to West Knoxville or to Maryville Alcoa for the big stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3636)|
| 1:00:44| All there is in that area is convenience type shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| No, I'm not saying anything bad about Weigel's or Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Those are great neighborhood stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Everybody in this room probably stops at one every morning for their cup of coffee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| or a store just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| And they are convenience stores for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| And Dollar General Store is a convenience store for items that people need for their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| And that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Councilman Hucklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Well, I appreciate what Mr. Seymour is saying, but in response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| as was pointed out by some of those opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| there are quite a few commercially zoned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| including a series of parcels at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| at the east-northeast intersection, I guess it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| of Governor Johnson Highway and Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| that are more suitable and more accessible because they're accessible to both highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| And this is not the only choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| And what we're talking about here is creeping commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| And Governor Johnson himself, if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| they'll probably come back and ask for commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| for the parcel on the other side of their office complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| And then, you know, somebody else is going to come along and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| well, gosh, look, you know, they gave commercial to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| How can you deny it to us because somebody gave commercial down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| So I think the best thing to do is to draw the line and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| let's uphold what's been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Anybody to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| I heard two noes from Mr. Booker and Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I heard seven ayes and two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| And the ayes were for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Got that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Then the motion is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| We are now moot, as Ms. Mitchell reminds me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| So we will move on to Mr. Greve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Is that him in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| I think, did we move that there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| No, we moved it on further back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| So you're still not up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| We're going to go on to 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| to accept a grant award of $500,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| National Institute of Justice for assistance in solving cold cases through technology advances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| and biological evidence analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| in fee simple real property and improvements located at 1763 Hillwood Avenue from Mrs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| Barbara U. Wells for $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Mr. Hoplitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Well, Mr. Hill may want to say something about this, but I think it's an excellent thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| that we're doing because it does facilitate the eventual realignment of Hillwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| And Ms. Wells was put in a very difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Her husband died months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| This was a rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3842)|

| 1:04:25| wanting to buy the property, upgrade the apartment, small apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| And they just have to be told, well, that's probably not a wise investment because the city's going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| take this building in order to do the Hillwood improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| So she was really in a difficult place, and this is somewhere that we want to go as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3879)|

| 1:06:07| Folks, we've been at that since 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| We formed our Golden Glove Charities and we've had a lot of success with our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| with our national events we brought to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Plans are still in the making to bring another National Golden Glove Tournament here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| and possibly a National Junior Golden Glove Tournament here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| which is healthy during the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| As you all know, East Knoxville gets lambasted occasionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| with being a downridden place to live or place to do a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| And, of course, a guy was in our gym the other day and he came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| He said he used to train there and he was standing there talking to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| and I was fixing the popcorn machine, getting it ready to put in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| He said, by the way, what's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| I said, I'm Ace Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| He said, no, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4011)|

| 1:06:54| He said, I know I fought for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| I said, well, this is me, pal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| He said, well, you've done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| I said, all I've done is live a good, clean life out here in Golden Gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| But he did look around at the gym and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| this place is beautiful compared to what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| So we work hard out there to keep a healthy program for boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| We deal with Chicano, blacks, whites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| It doesn't matter to us as long as they're properly performed in the gym| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| and what we want in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| We don't allow a lot of thugs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| We have a sign that says, paints up, shirts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| And that's one of the things we're going to push for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| And I'm just a hard-headed guy that says I can't enforce it in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| So thanks to you people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| You've always supported our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| And I certainly hope that you'll accept the contract that Joe Walsh has worked up for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| And we look forward to a very successful 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| I will be 80 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4069)|

| 1:11:13| 11K is a resolution urging the legislature of the state of Tennessee to decline to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| a number of proposed bills which would threaten the quality of water in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| requested by Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| I thought there was going to be somebody from the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| If they could come down, because I know there were some, I think there are councilmembers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| that might like to have some information about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| My name is Renee Oyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| I'm at 327 East Quincy Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| Do you have any back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| I think Councilmember Hultquist said if you can give the council any background on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| We've got a series of Senate bills listed and House bill, the House bill, Senate bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| pairs listed, SB0631, et cetera, all the way down through SB1312.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4318)|
| 1:12:07| And we drafted this hoping that you all would, based on your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| knowing that these are serious issues, but expecting you to give more background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Well, first, thank you for taking up this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| On behalf of the network members, we really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| There seems to be a run on the natural resources in Tennessee by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| These bills are the top ten that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| There's actually almost 17 bills that are quite detrimental to the natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| resources of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| You can divide them into four groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| We have, they are bills to remove protection from state rivers and streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| bills that will lower the protective standards to the federal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| which is in many cases much lower than the state's current standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| bills that are possibly unconstitutional, and bills that are just plain silly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| But a lot of them deal with changing the definition of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| There are a number of bills that will not allow the public to have an access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| to decisions that are affecting their resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| There's actually a new bill that came out today that says that if you are a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| holder and you're in compliance with your permit, you are exempt from nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| So there's just a number of bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| I can go through each of them if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| I have a quick fact sheet, but there are ten here on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Would you like me to do that individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| I think if council members have questions or concerns in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| that might be the best way of handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Well, I, for one, have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| I hate to be voting, telling our representatives to oppose a bill when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| really don't have any idea what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| I mean, I'm for clean water and preserving it, but I don't know what any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| these bills say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| So I have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Do you have the fact sheet and copies of the fact sheet you can distribute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| I just have fact sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| I didn't know that you guys didn't have the fact sheets for all of these bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| We were never provided with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I just have my own copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| Let me go to Ms. Roddy, and then I'll go to Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Let me go to Ms. Roddy first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| I saw hers, and then I'll go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| No, I agree with Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| I'm all for clean water as well, but I can't support this bill tonight without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| knowing what I'm voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| So I guess I would like to make a motion to postpone this item for two weeks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| get some further information on what's going on with these bills, and then when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| I'm better informed to vote, I can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| There's a second, and then I'm going to go to Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Well, I guess, I mean, I don't necessarily have a problem with postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| I mean, obviously, the legislature takes its own sweet time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| But I guess I went ahead, not knowing these, talked to our engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| department, our stormwater guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| And they actually support all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| They actually think that this is the right resolution to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| And my sense is, you know, I don't need to read these bills when, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| city people that deal with this feel that this is the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| So I'd be comfortable voting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| But I don't think I have a problem with a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| I'll go to Mr. Hulkless and then to Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Well, I'm glad Vice Mayor Becker brought that up because I have also talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| our stormwater people and got exactly the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| But I understand that the rest of council needs a level of information that will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| the amount of information will give them a level of comfort in voting for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| So they'll really know what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| So I'm okay with a postponement, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Well, we always hear what the Metropolitan Planning Commission has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| And we vote up or down, depending on our points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Mr. Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Ms. Hoyos would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| She was gesturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Is this coming up for a vote real soon in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Actually, I was kind of surprised that the bills were all listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| We were really hoping for a resolution just in support of protective legislation for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| I'm happy to have those bills stricken if that makes the council members feel more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4572)|
| 1:16:21| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| A comment on the question that was just asked about whether a two-week postponement would create any problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| for our considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| The session is two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| We'll see these bills back again, even if they are put on a general sub or rolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I'm happy to supply these for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| The motion on the floor is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Mr. Hoffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Again, I think we should postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| In the meantime, hopefully have adequate communication with the Clean Water Network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| and either get more information on these bills or change the resolution, one or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| or some combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| The motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4627)|

| 1:18:10| With Council's permission, may I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| It doesn't affect the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Actually, can we deal with this item and then come back to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4694)|

| 1:18:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Now, excuse me, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| My comment on Item 11L having to do with asking the Metropolitan Planning Commission to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| up this issue, I have an overriding concern that we continue to send to the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| Commission projects, special projects, without any kind of communication from that body as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| to whether or not they have the capacity to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| And in a macro sense, ongoing, I would like a better sense of what the priorities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| with the Metropolitan Planning Commission in terms of their work product, what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| able to accomplish within their staffing and their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| And when a project is sent their way, I'd like to be able to know where that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| to fall on the priority list or if it might potentially bump something off the work plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| that this Council might feel has a higher priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| And I did support this, but I guess in the future, I don't feel like I can support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| resolutions like this without having a better understanding of what the work plan and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| priority system is at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Councilman Hawkes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| I appreciate Councilman Roddy's comments, and I guess I echo them to a large degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| Having put a resolution like this on the agenda myself, I think there was one for developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| a form-based code for the Vestal Redevelopment Area, and as far as I know, that's still sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| of out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| But in addition to what she suggested, I think we might request from them some sort of periodic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| reporting back so that we get feedback of where we do stand on all these requests that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| have been put into the hopper, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| I mean, you can only do so many things, and you can only do so many things well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| And so an understanding of some priorities would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Well, since we're making comments on that, and I hesitate to – I didn't see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| anyone else was having any difficulty with that, so I didn't make a comment earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| But I, too, have a lot of concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| And frankly, you know, since we are in a position of sunshining our deliberations, that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| that I was in no position to call the councilman who had requested that resolution be before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| us and discuss it with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| And I have absolutely no idea – I mean, that's an area which I believe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| could use a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| However, I have no idea if there is a reason that that is coming before us now and if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| something that's urgent or, you know, just where it falls in our total need of work product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| So I really find it difficult to have these resolutions before us and no way to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| it with the presenter of the resolution prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| So I don't know how we resolve that, but maybe in a workshop we can talk about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| we might find ways to help us to be better informed about resolutions that come up that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| are specific to an area or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Councilman Hoekstra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| In response to Councilman Pelos' statement, which I agree with also, perhaps the vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| maker being the maker of this resolution would – or author of this resolution could consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| maybe helping us put together a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| The administration has agenda information sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Maybe we could do something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| Oh, for council resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| I had not thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| That's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| I don't think we have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| I guess we're ready to move to the next item then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| 11N is a resolution requesting and encouraging the legislature of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| to adopt legislation promoted by the Tennessee Public Safety Coalition, which would enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| the penalties for certain violent crimes and provide for an increased number of prosecutors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| to enforce these laws, requested by Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Then we go back to 9A, which is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| B, Zoning Regulations, Article V, Section 10, signs, billboards, and other advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| structures and related sections regarding electronic message centers on a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| directory sign approved as part of a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| We have two folks signed up to speak in favor and two against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| I'll call the two in favor first, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Bedwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Let's agree who wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Who wants to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Typically, those in favor go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| You know, if the three of you, if you bump your heads together, it will look famous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=4995)|
| 1:23:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Mr. Greave, if you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| Dwayne Greave, number eight, Emory Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| First of all, I want to thank Council and Mayor for putting this off and also thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| Arthur for allowing me to attend the Eagle Ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| Where we are on this, first of all, Mayor, can I have a clear understanding of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| actually voting on tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Mr. Swanson, you want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| Well, you're voting on the ordinance with regard to electronic message centers on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| development directory sign, which is approved as a part of a master sign plan as it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| amended last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| And I've forgotten the number of square feet now, but it's 250 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| For a unified, for 100 plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I didn't think you wanted me to read him the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Mayor Burton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| The last couple of days, between the three of us and actually the four of us, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| discussed this off and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| And several concerns that we have about the way the ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| Number one, scenic Knoxville, first of all, our thought was that 150 square feet would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| be the maximum amount that we would like to see a sign go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| We've thus talked with Arthur and the group, and we've talked about whether or not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5090)|
| 1:24:59| a sign, especially the one that Turkey Creek is doing, that if it were to be 250 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| feet, whether or not that something could be added to the ordinance that said a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| fronting along the interstate for a uniform development containing 100 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| which goes back to one of the original statements that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| The concern that we have is that if we go with the 250 square feet the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| that then implies that a development area in other places in town could also go up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| 250 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| We're concerned, for instance, if the Sherrill property, which is more than 100 acres, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| it were developed, that there would be the possibility of a sign, an EMC of 250 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| feet, which we think that there ought to be consideration given to where these signs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| So one of the things that we considered was the fact that Turkey Creek being along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| interstate, the desires that they have, that maybe if something like that were added, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| As we've said from the very beginning and after how many council meetings, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| that we're really concerned about signage in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| But I know tonight we're specifically working on the development sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| Also just would like to have the record read that Scenic Knoxville is definitely pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| with what Turkey Creek has done in terms of setting the bar for development of signs within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| As Scenic Knoxville, we continue to be concerned about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| We're pleased that council took the steps not only with digital billboards but with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| So I think what I'm asking for is a little bit of discussion, and I know we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| tired of discussion, but a little bit of discussion based on the fact of whether or not it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| be either amended to 150 square feet or it could be amended to have the 250 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| along the interstate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| So that would be a request that we would have on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Mr. Hall, do you want to ask something now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| I'd like to ask Mr. Greaves a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Am I to understand that if it was amended to say what you just said, that Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| would support the 250 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| As long as the clause was added that it was along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Barbara, now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Well, I'll just make a quick comment and say that Mr. Greaves and I had that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| earlier this week, and they were giving it consideration, and I was glad to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| they felt that had some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| Robert Bedwell, 1321 Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| We are ready for a vote with that language, with the understanding that it puts it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| We are back here again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| But if that solves this issue and we don't have to have any more discussion, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| live with this, and we appreciate your all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| I have some other folks signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Mayor, does it go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Would it have to go back, Mr. Swanson, to first reading if it's amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| I'm afraid what they're referring to is a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| It's not something that would have to go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| it is a substantive change in what is being proposed and, therefore, would be on first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Now, if you wanted to do it tonight and get it done and get it over with, there's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| the possibility that you could amend it to emergency after you amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| But that's strictly up to what City Council wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Ms. Phelan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| It's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Ms. Cash, how did I get the feeling that there was something you would like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| But am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I could see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| I just want to make sure that Mr. Bedwell and Mr. Seymour understand that the sketch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| that I was presented just prior to the meeting does not comply with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| The signage that is shown on here does not adequately represent what the ordinance allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| And when you calculate it as directed by the existing ordinance, their sign comes out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| 832.5 square feet, not 399.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| And Mr. Donaldson and I have discussed this, and we do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| We will discuss that with the city engineering and signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| That's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| We only want to concentrate on the 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Are there more people who want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Yeah, I think there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Joyce Feld has signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| Joyce, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| My address is 1540 Aguila Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| I have several concerns about this Turkey Creek EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| First, I would be curious to know how much it will cost for a business to advertise on this EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5403)|
| 1:30:12| I know several council members have mentioned that this would give small businesses in Turkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| Creek the opportunity to increase their visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| But do we know how many small businesses will be either able or willing to pay for this opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5420)|
| 1:30:28| I'm not aware of any small businesses that have stepped forward during the course of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| to say that they're even interested in advertising on the EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| Also, I'm concerned that rather than small businesses, it's going to be the sign owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| who will be the primary beneficiaries of this new revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| Next, while it's true that Turkey Creek brings a lot of tax revenue into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| this is not all new revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Were Turkey Creek not there, much and perhaps most of that consumer spending would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| taken place at other Knoxville businesses in other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| A case can even be made that Turkey Creek has had a detrimental effect on many businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| in other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| I know there have been several businesses and restaurants that have closed down entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| or moved to Turkey Creek because they felt they could no longer compete in their original location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| Recently, Marshall's moved to Turkey Creek and closed their West Knoxville location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| Since the new Marshall's is now located in Farragut, the city has lost the tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| that Marshall's generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| Best Buy, JCPenney, and Belk have also opened new Turkey Creek locations in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| If they decide to close their West Knoxville stores, the city will again lose significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| And as an aside, please note that the strict sign law in Farragut did not stop any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| businesses from locating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Turkey Creek has nowhere to expand in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| All new development will be in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| And so how many more businesses might the city lose to Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| EMCs are unsafe unsightly and unsafe no matter where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| This is not just a matter of protecting scenic vistas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| Whatever the background, the presence of a large EMC causes visual pollution and is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| major distraction for drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| And I think the safety issue has somewhat gotten lost in all of this discussion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| it is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| And while I know these questions have been asked here before, I still wonder why Turkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| Creek should be able to preserve the internal visual integrity of their development while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| forcing this visual pollution on the thousands of motorists who drive I-40 every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| In addition, why should Turkey Creek be allowed to advertise businesses located in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| Farragut on a Knoxville sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| If the town of Farragut has the courage to stand firm against this visual intrusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| why doesn't the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Farragut has just as much investment in the financial success of Turkey Creek as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| This council has shown itself to be responsible, responsive, and progressive by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| enacting a ban on new EMCs, and I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| Personally, I don't think there should be any exceptions to this ban for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| developments with master signage plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| If you are inclined to grant an exception, and unfortunately it looks like you're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| in that direction, I would ask that you keep this exception as small as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| I do think 250 square feet is too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| And if you do grant an exception, the maximum allowable size should be smaller on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5618)|
| 1:33:45| secondary arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| I don't think that we should allow on Kingston Pike what you're willing to allow on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| I have two questions for Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| You just answered Ms. Pillow's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| You just said that when you take this thing that Mr. Bidwell says is 399.5 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| and you measure it, you get something like 850.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Now, you said you came at 425.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| I wouldn't ask why, but it seems like the number you came up with is far enough off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| that I've got to ask why because it seems hugely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| Article 5, Section 10A16 tells you how to measure the square footage of a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| And when you measure that square footage as directed in that, you come up with 832.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5677)|
| 1:34:46| square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| And I guess that's a we'll only be on first reading, so we can talk about that in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| The other question I got for you is to be clear on what can be said on this EMC if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| And I guess one is can stores that locate in the Farragut portion of Turkey Creek advertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| And, frankly, can anybody advertise or are they limited only to showing the names of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| I don't know what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| As you understand, that might actually be a question for Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| But I tend to think you know all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| Mr. Donaldson and I have also discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| The City of Knoxville, nor MPC, regulates Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| The property for Turkey Creek that is located inside Farragut is not part of the unified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| development plan, nor is it included in the master sign plan that was approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Therefore, it is our interpretation that only the businesses that are located inside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| City of Knoxville can advertise on this EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| However, Law Director Poplin may rule different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| But that is our interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| And can you advertise or just list names of signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Because I know in a development directory you can only put names of stores on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| So what's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| You would only be able to list the names of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Names of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| And, in addition, they will also have to go back to the Planning Commission for a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| amendment for this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Ms. Poplin, I'd like to clarify that understanding of a development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| Because in talking to some of the development personnel from Turkey Creek, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| understanding was the hopes was that something could be put up like Hannah Montana opens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| tonight or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| But this development directory can only list Regal Cinemas, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| It would just be the name of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Just the name of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Yeah, we don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Ms. Mitchell, we do not have a motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| I'll make the motion to amend it to include the Interstate Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| We need an original motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| There's no motion at all on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| So we need a motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Now, Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| And then I'll make the motion to amend it to include the Interstate Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| What does that say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| We have some language here that we worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| You want to go ahead and throw it out and we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| And then maybe bring it here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| It would go...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| We had it written out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Dwayne may have it ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| Dwayne, you get some paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| We would add it basically at the end of a unified development of 100 acres or more...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| Fronting along the interstate for a unified development containing 100 acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Add at the end of the existing language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| a development directory sign approved as part of a master signage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| for a unified development of 100 acres or more fronting on an interstate highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| And that would go in all three sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| Is that clear that the sign itself addresses the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| No, it's only...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| That gives the development approval for the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| We can refine language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| but I'm not sure you want to put a sign on a secondary road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| if you do have the traffic counts on the interstate highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| I might discuss this more with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| We would be happy to limit it to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| Go ahead, Mr. Barron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Let me also ask about just fronting on sort of indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| as long as we've got, you know, a three-inch wide thing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| I think put a minimum of 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| 500 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| I mean, it kind of makes sense to do some things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I mean, clearly we're intending this just to be Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| so we should be as clear about that as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Well, we're intending this to be any development in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| such as Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| If it meets that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| And if it fronts on an interstate highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And if it fronts on an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| We're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Did they vote on that each time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| Well, we're actually making laws for all those other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| We're intending it for Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Right now, the motion on the floor is to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| Are we ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| We read what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| You want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| It will read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| the EMC shall have a minimum matrix area of 20 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| and a maximum matrix area of 25% of the total approved square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| of the development directory sign or 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| whatever is greater, or 250 or 100, I guess, 250 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| You don't want me to read all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| We've got a little mix-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Running along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Just that part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6028)|

| 1:40:35| This is the one that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| This is the one I gave you with my writing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| With a 500-foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| You want me to read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| It will be a development directory sign approved as a part of a master signage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| for a unified development of 100 acres or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| on an interstate highway with a 500-foot minimum may incorporate one electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| as an integral part of a business ground or monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6077)|

| 1:41:37| And that's repeated in three places in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| All those in favor of amending, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6106)|

| 1:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| So the motion is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Now, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Back to the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| My question is if this is approved on emergency tonight or in two weeks or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| the representation that we were provided tonight, there seems to be some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| as to how accurately that represents what we might end up with in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| in terms of the measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Is there any way to clarify that tonight before we take a final vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Well, this is back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| I don't think so, but we'll certainly be discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Make sure whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| What happens if someone moves to do this on an emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| Well, we still have to comply with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| We have to comply with whatever you all pass, but I understood you were just going to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| I would say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| I mean, you're not objecting if someone made the motion to pass this on emergency tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| You're not objecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| We have to comply with the city law, and that's what we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6176)|

| 1:44:47| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Yeah, let me just take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Since this is in the same area of the earlier thing that we asked for a down zoning on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| fill folks in, there's been a lot of changes in the Inskip area, a lot of additional growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| in the last 20 years, a lot of apartments, frankly, coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| I think in the last year or two, there have been a couple of incidents that have sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| of mobilized neighborhood folks to wake up to that and to start talking about what to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| There have been a couple of neighborhood meetings talking about it pretty much on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| informal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Folks clearly want to start the entire area is zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Most of it is still single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| A lot of consensus on getting back to the zoning that's appropriate for what exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| which is why we had the earlier resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| Some interest in eventually doing some work with MPC on some kind of an Inskip small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| area plan, which is not happening now because some of the questions you raised about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| Ms. Roddy, about the capacity to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| One of the developers who has been involved with the discussions of this is actually this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| fellow who's doing the property here, been very supportive of what the neighborhood wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| to do, and in agreement since this property especially is clearly an office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| that this is an appropriate zone even with all the other changes that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| So the neighborhood folks that have been talking about a lot of hopeful improvements in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| Inskips have checked off on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| So I wanted to fill you in and explain this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| To reiterate again, Mr. Becker, on the next to last page of our packet, we were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| with the minutes from the MPC meeting, and there are comments in the record from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| Donaldson saying that next year we will work out a small area plan for the Inskip Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| So if that commitment has already been made to the Inskip neighborhood on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| I again would just like to reiterate that as a body, the City of Knoxville contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| with the Metropolitan Planning Commission for work product, and there is only limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| capacity to do that, and I think we just need to get a better understanding of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| system of prioritization is for those work products, and when something new is added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| to the list, what does it bump?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| Yes, just I had not read that and was not at the MPC meeting, but the neighborhood folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| have been said, told that we're going to ask to get this done, and it will be a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| So I appreciate that you're pointing out that Mr. Donaldson has already committed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| That makes me happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090407?start=6443)|
