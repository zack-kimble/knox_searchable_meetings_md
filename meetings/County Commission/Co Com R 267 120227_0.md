| 0:01:45| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=105)|

| 0:02:16| the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| They've been sworn, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Next item is the consideration of suspension revocation of a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Clerk, if you'd read that into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Murphy Oil Express, number 8616-7555,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Fork Station Way, Murphy Oil USA, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I'll defer to our sheriff's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| Would you please state the case to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| I'm Alan Wolfie May, North Carolina Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| And on January 19, 2012, I conducted an underage beer sting at Murphy Oil at 8616 Fork Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=167)|
| 0:02:58| And I did purchase alcohol by my underage minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| Did you say they were out of Bud Light, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=190)|
| 0:03:20| I'm here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Do you want me to proceed now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Do you want to state your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Yes, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, along with Pamela Newton, who is the area manager for Murphy Oil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=205)|
| 0:03:36| and Charlie Ferguson, who is the store manager at Murphy Oil where the incident occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=216)|
| 0:03:46| Do you want us to state our case now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| You heard the testimony of the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Do you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Do you have mitigating circumstances you want to present to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Well, as a result of this, there had been a change in procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| The young lady, as I understand, who was the clerk who sold to the sheriff's department's cadet, had been shopped once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| had not sold alcohol at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| The store is a modern store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| It's equipped with scanners for the sale of any age-sensitive product, lottery tickets, alcohol, tobacco, cigarette lighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=257)|
| 0:04:27| The clerks are to scan the ID from the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| She simply overrode it and said the person was over 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| That is not to occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| The orders now are to scan everybody's driver's license, even if I come in there for a beer or anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| and they put signs up now that go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| You might explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| You all have got signs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Signs posted on every single corridor, the WeCard, ID, everyone, no matter what it is, even lighters, tobacco, lottery, cigarettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=293)|
| 0:05:02| obviously beer, any age-restricted product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| No matter what age you are, we scan them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| We don't override them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Could we get her name, Arthur, for the record, please, your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| I'm Pamela Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| My address is 10710 Garden Crossing Way in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Do you want to add anything, Carly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| She's one of the store managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| She loses a bonus every time this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Every time she loses a state thing, she loses her commission bonus for the three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| and if it happens again, the manager loses their job at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| Could you state your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| My name is Charlie Ferguson, and my address is 7900 Courts and Littoral Road, Fortune, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| Is this going to happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| We actually are doing spot checks on all of our cashiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| and I've told every one of my cashiers first-time offense that they don't scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| and the ID scans, they will be fired right on the spot, and I will continue their shift for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| Are all of your clerks alcohol seller trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| We have a seller certification that they have to do, complete the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| before they have any register time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| It's a video that they take home with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| It's about two hours, and there's an online test that's administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Do you review this with the Sheriff's Department, or are they satisfied with the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| It's still compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| And furthermore, you all are shopped by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| It's a CRI compliance certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| It's a mystery shop program that visits the site once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| They check things for cleanliness, appearance of a tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| but they also buy any restricted product to make sure that their ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| and the site hasn't failed at any time from our compliance shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Just a couple points of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Over the last couple of years, I've been working with a couple of different committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| on trying to see what we could do to stop underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| and working with the city and the county to try to dovetail our laws together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| We're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| We'll have something to bring to this group, hopefully, before too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| But one of the things I brought up early on, there's a couple of people around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| businesses in our county here that operate in our county that have their own training systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| And Murphy happens to be one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| And at the time, it was touted to us that they had one of the better training programs around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| So things do slip through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And as Mr. Seymour pointed out, this girl did pass the test once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| but maybe her boyfriend got mad at her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| She flew far this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| I guess the motion would be that we fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=463)|

| 0:11:41| Wolfie, is this the case about which we spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| Do you have anything you want to state for the record for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=705)|

| 0:11:59| and I'm doing a criminal investigation on that location right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| So I would ask that we defer this for 30 days until I can complete my investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=725)|
| 0:12:16| Motion is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=737)|

| 0:12:20| You need 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Can you do it in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| So the motion is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Would you like to address that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| We want to give you an opportunity to speak, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| As far as I know, I didn't know anything about it being a criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| I received a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| I was at the hospice out in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| A friend of mine's father was passing away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| and the people that were there running the place for me that night said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| you need to get here, you're being raided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| Wolfie and some officers come into the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| and they seize a security monitor and the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| and I get a certificate for property on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| And everything is obtained with no warrant or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| And like I've told Wolfie before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| if there's been any problem with the way I conduct business there, feel free to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| We can discuss it instead of putting all the manpower of the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| and anything that would affect that beer license on that establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| because with my understanding, if there is a problem with anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| that would reflect something with that beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| that my beer license, I should be brought before this group, this body of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| to take care of the problem and work with you and this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| to be a good taxpaying revenue establishment for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| And hopefully there will be no issues on what Officer May finds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| and we can continue doing business and I can be a good taxpayer for the county of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Mr. Pendleton, where exactly is this on Clinton Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=848)|

| 0:23:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| We do have a quorum present and we do have two people who have signed up to speak at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| First, I'd like to recognize John Mills from Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| That's not John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| That's not John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Not John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and fellow members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I want to introduce John here very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I think all of you know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| He's a former county commissioner, works now for Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| And John's going to come up here in just a second and tell a story of something that happened to him recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| He's been kind enough to share his story with us and with the community because I think there's a lesson to be learned from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| that can not only save perhaps our lives but maybe the lives of people that we care about very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| And so listen to it closely when John's speaking because it's a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| very typical story of what we see these days on people that have a problem like John had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| And after he finishes, I'd like to make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Can we ask him questions, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| We can grill him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Give us your name and address of the record, please, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| John Mills, 9606 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| Fellow commissioners, that's the way I'm going to talk to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| you're looking at a guy right now that definitely has been kissed by an angel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1464)|
| 0:24:33| I had several things that happened to me for several months and I ignored them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1473)|
| 0:24:45| A lot of them I ignored as if they were muscle spasms or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| I had a slight, well, it wasn't slight, but I had a numbness in my left arm one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| and I thought my arm had gone to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| You know how your arm goes to sleep and you try to shake it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| So I ignored that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Then there were several others, indigestion, and several things that I totally ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| One night I had a pretty sharp pain in my left shoulder in the back, I mean right shoulder in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| and I told Ms. Charlotte, my wife, I told her, I said, I'm having a muscle spasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| And so she rubbed me down with some hot stuff and I felt better the next morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| But when I got up the next morning, I felt, you know, a pressure was put on me on my right side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| and I told her I wasn't feeling good and she said, well, just go sit down and rest a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| And then we went on to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| We had a staff meeting down at rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| And when I walked into the staff room, Rob Webb, our district general manager, you people know Rob Webb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1559)|
| 0:26:09| he took one look at me and he said, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| And I said, well, I felt better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| And immediately they escorted me to the back in the ambulance area in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| And they hooked everything up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| And I know how to read one of these programs that comes across the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1586)|
| 0:26:35| I know what a straight line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| You know, I don't pay a whole lot of attention to it as long as it's not a straight line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| But anyway, I looked at this thing and it was jumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| I mean, it was going up and down and I could read their faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| So, gentlemen, ladies, don't be stubborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| Don't be like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| If you feel something, listen to your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| It's talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| You go be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And it just so happened that I was in the right place at the right time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| and there's millions of people out there that wouldn't be that lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| I was surrounded by paramedics, professionals at rural metro that knew what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| They do this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| They save someone's lives every day, just like me, being stubborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| So listen to your body and be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| I don't care what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| If it's a pain somewhere, pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| And there's several things you can look at and say, oh, that right there is not normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| Be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Better to be safe than sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| And I come so close within hours of being sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| And I do appreciate every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I really do love you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Please listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| John, we are glad that you're doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| You look good and so we're just glad that you were able to get to the doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and that you had folks right there with you that were taking care of you the whole way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And when you said kissed by an angel, I know you were talking about Miss Charlotte, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| That's everyday business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Yes, I won't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| And that's the first time you've ever said I look good, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| Commissioner Briggs, you wanted to also add some comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I'll just take a second here because this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| It's a very important lesson to learn here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| Some people think that you can't die of stubbornness, but you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| And I think that the lesson that we can learn from John is, one, first of all, in ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| we can't ignore symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And some of those are heaviness in the chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| It's what may be indigestion, pain going down your arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Sometimes it goes up into the neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Sometimes it can hurt into the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| John described just about all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| But I think it's just as important not only for ourselves, but if we have loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| or people that we work with that are having those symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| particularly if they're starting to look pretty sick, you need to call 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| If they're having them every now and then, insist that they go see their doctor and be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| John's story is just so typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| We know John, and we know he's a stubborn guy, but particularly in men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| there's this element of denial that can kill or it can disable a person if they do survive their heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| if there's been a lot of heart muscle that's been damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| So I really want to thank John for coming down here and sharing this with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| because it does bring to light the number one killer in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| About 80% of the people that die in this country are going to die of heart attacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| and it's just a shame when those things can be prevented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and either denial or stubbornness keeps us from treating it before it becomes a deadly problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| So thank you very much, John, and thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for allowing us to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Let's hear it for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1838)|
| 0:30:48| Also on public forum, we have Mr. Ricky Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Is Mr. Davis here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Mr. Davis, you can come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| My name is Ricky Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I live at 618 Truesdale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I'm here to try to inform the public of what's going on in our court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| This sign here I brought up, like I said, I'm exercising my freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| When I came in the door, it was taken away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| This side sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| It speaks about Ella Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Like I say, I got tapes and all of it brings all the stuff up and evidence and all the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1892)|
| 0:31:41| The judges have done everything they can to hurt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| They've taken my sons away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| My son at 10 years old threw a knife at his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| When he was 12 years old, he threw a fork stuck in his brother's arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| But I went before Swan and demonstrated how she had my 5-year-old son beaten across the back with a closed fist at 5 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| She had my 3-year-old son slapping him across the face and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| And I demonstrated in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Bill Swan ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Bill Swan said in court, I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| And with the sorry people I had, we need to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Like I say, Judge Moyer was just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| When I filed a claim against him and then brought a sign out, he wrote an order that I should have my children taken away from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| because I got exposed to him about him beating up his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| There's an allegation he beat his wife up from Church Street Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| I went and played volleyball there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| And then, like I say, when he neglected my domestic violence against my kids or whatever, I started making it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| Now, since then, I've had everything in the world done to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| It's called exiling my freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| So everyone, like I say, Judge Moyer, I got tapes of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| There's allegations that what I was told was him and the secretary disappeared all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| And when I was calling about my case or whatever, every time I called, the secretary was never there, very seldom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| So one day I called the clerk's office, and the clerk told me that Judge Moyer and his secretary had gone to Nashville for the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=1998)|
| 0:33:28| Later on, I called and the secretary answered the phone with her, and I asked her if she filled out a special report for a trip to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| She said she never went to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Well, the person who told me that has been an employee of the county here for, I guess, a number of years and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| And, like I say, somebody's lying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| But, like I say, if they're out doing things and charging the state for hours of work and not working, that's fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2026)|
| 0:33:55| Then if Moyer is signing his paycheck and all, he's trying to fraud the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| So, like I say, I'm just speaking out for the people, let people know what's going on, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Moyer wrote an order and sent it to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| We never had our hearing or nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Actually, so he did twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Like I say, Swan, he neglected domestic violence since my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| And, like I say, when he neglected it, like I say, he said, I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| When he did that, that's when it came out with a sign and all that stuff, and I filed a complaint against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| I got him in line to the Board of Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| He said no evidence was submitted for domestic violence against kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| It's all in transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| I demonstrated he had a five-year-old son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| I mean, my ex-wife had my five-year-old son pulled up by one arm, beating her as she could across the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Testified that she had my three-year-old son slapping him across the face as hard as she could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| I mean, as hard as she could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| That happened many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| But, like I say, when I try to get my kids away from that environment, they took parenting time away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Like I say, my son has been suspended from school four times because poor parenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| But, like I say, my ex-wife has custody, and that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Like I say, I'm trying to inform the county people what we need to do to get rid of some of the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Now move to the honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Oh, shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| I only have one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| They came in and took my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| And when they took my car and sold it, $800 cash disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| The TBI needs to be informed of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And, listen, I've got tape recorders and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| I've got evidence of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| These two deputies should be fired with no retirement, nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| We have three honorary resolutions, and we'll go into our first resolution, R-12-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2155)|

| 0:38:08| and whereas the three-year record for the seniors on the team is 60-29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2288)|

| 0:38:17| and whereas the West High School wrestling team's hard work, dedication, and talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| were all contributing factors to their successful season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| The commission of Knox County hereby honors the West High School wrestling team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| for an outstanding season and qualifying for the Class AAA state wrestling tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| and be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the West High School wrestling team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| by head coach Mark Giles, assistant coach Phillip Cottrell, and assistant coach Matt Gabriel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I have a little interest in this only because my son is one of the wrestlers on this team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| and has been for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| He got involved in wrestling, didn't know anything about it three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| I have learned a lot and that it costs a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| This is a non-generating revenue sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| so therefore everything that is required to send these teams every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| that they qualify to state tournament is raised solely by the parents of these wrestlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| as well as any public involvement that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| But for this team, Coach Giles took over four years ago, and they were not very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2380)|
| 0:39:51| He was actually one of the first wrestlers on the very first wrestling team at West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| and he came back to coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| And he has led this team through very little talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| and teaching these children how to learn a skill, learn a trait, learn dedication and pushing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2403)|
| 0:40:13| And they have risen in their division, in their district, in their region to one of the top schools now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| And that's very astounding when you have no money funding you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| So I just wanted to recognize them and their dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| and what Coach Giles, the many hours he's put in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| And he's also the assistant football coach of the West High Rebels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| which have came very close to going to state championship game two years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| So I'd like to give him a chance to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| The only thing I want to say is it's always good to be honored when you have a successful season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| And some of these guys, James' particular senior class that goes 60 and 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| basically coming from a program that had never really done anything wrestling-wise, is a huge, huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| And hopefully we can continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| But it's just awesome to be honored, and we're very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| I would throw this out to anybody who's interested, who wants to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2480)|

| 0:41:32| It's 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2492)|

| 0:41:37| It's been covered one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2497)|

| 0:42:00| and everybody's been having some personal problems this season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| but we were able to pull it together at the end of the season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2524)|

| 0:46:06| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| I was fortunate enough to just happen to stand shortly at a reception five or six weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| and overheard some people talking about it's about to be the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| And I know of all the hundreds of people I've known who have been Girl Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| and the great things they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| And I put on four or five pounds every winter when I buy Girl Scout cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| I guess that's the number one contribution I've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| But nevertheless, my son is a – I only have a son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| He's a Boy Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| So I'm going to defer to Commissioner Brawls briefly to let her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| further enhance the things that the Girl Scouts have done in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2799)|

| 0:47:00| I've been a Girl Scout leader for six years, and my daughter Aiden is in her six year of Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| And my younger daughter Avery is a Daisy this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| after spending all of her preschool years as what they call a tag-along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| who tags along with her older sister's troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| And they actually do let men join Girl Scouts too, the fathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| And they call them doodads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| So there's a place for everyone in Scouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| And I'm really proud of all of the Girl Scouts in Knox County and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| that I've met and worked with over the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2853)|

| 0:47:41| it was amazing when I was a Brownie Scout in elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| but the things that the Scouts are doing now, it's not your mama's Scout troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| It's amazing what they're doing now, incredible stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=2872)|

| 0:50:36| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3040)|

| 0:50:47| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| We reside in the Great Smoky Mountain Council, which serves some 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| And we have on average of about 200 eagles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| gentlemen that earn eagles every year from the 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| And our law director, Joe Jarrett, has a vital part in that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| As a commissioner, I'm going to let Joe speak for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Just briefly, thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| I served the council as a unit commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| And not to alarm any parents, but when I was a soldier overseas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| some of my finest soldiers were Eagle Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| So bear that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| But what we have here with us is Ted Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| who is on the executive committee of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| and he can give you a better understanding of just how broad the Eagle Scout program is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| and how effective it is for our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| Ted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| Larry, Commissioner Larry Smith mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| not that many people who join scouting make the Eagle rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| It's like the ultimate at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| We're very fortunate here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Scouting is very strong, both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and I think it's a tribute to the area that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| The Eagle Scouts have to do 21 merit badges, some required, some optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| and it's a community project, which is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| I'm on the board of review for the north part of the county and Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| and it's amazing what some of these young men, 16, 17, do for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| You know, when I was in scouts, Ted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| that's where I learned to do a good deed every day and not get paid money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| So, you know, and you'll see me out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| We do stuff like this out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| There's not a day that doesn't go by that you don't learn something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| that you don't use something that you learned in the Eagle Scout program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| in that trail to be an Eagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I do want to recognize one thing that we have here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| and I don't know of another record nationwide that can compete with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| A lot of you know Ted Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Ted, you are an Eagle Scout yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Ted, in what year was that Eagle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| We don't have to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Ted is an Eagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| I got mine in 1969 at Troop and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| But Ted, what's unique about Ted, Ted has not one, not two, not three, not four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| He has five sons that have reached the goal of Eagle Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| So we give him a big hand, recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And I don't know if anybody else in the nation even has that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| but we certainly applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Ethan Hollis Crossroads, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| I'd like to thank the commissioner for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| I'd also like to say thank you, not just to Knox County, but the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| the Knoxville Public School System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| and I'd have to get in a plug for my company, Regal Entertainment Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| We're very involved in Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, not just in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| but in 38 states that we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Thank you very much for the support of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Mr. Chairman, we're going to take this proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| and we're going to give it to the board directors at the Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Commissioners, it is 216.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3246)|

| 0:54:33| Commissioner Anders told us that he would not be able to make the meeting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| and so earlier we selected Commissioner Norman to serve as vice chair for our meeting here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| I'd like to recognize some folks who are in the audience with us, our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3280)|

| 0:54:56| and I think I've gotten all of our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| If not, I apologize for any oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Our devotional as we begin this portion of our meeting will be conducted by Commissioner Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3301)|

| 0:55:26| and we want to thank you especially for giving us all of the benefits that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| for living in this great country and in this great county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| Let us be civil today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Let us consider the resolutions and the issues that are before us in a very civil manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| and also give us the wisdom to try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| And as a final word, Lord, we would like you to give a special blessing to our soldiers who are overseas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3349)|

| 0:56:00| and rights that we enjoy in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3363)|

| 0:56:40| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| I would like to add to the agenda and the item we talked about in the Chairman's Luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| with regards to public hearings for billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Also, I would like to ask that Item 904, yes, 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| I received a letter from General Nichols who, informing me that even as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| there are motions that are being made in court to release the documents with regards to Judge Baumgartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| So he asked if we would delay for 30 days the resolution which we would send to the Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| and the legislature asking that those records be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| If he is successful, if they are successful, then those records may be released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| and we wouldn't need to send this on to the Governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| So I'm going to ask that that be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| I've been asked by Chief Bob Coker, or let me preface that, former KPD Chief Bob Coker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| current 911 Director Bob Coker, to discuss briefly with the Commission some important 911 data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| about some digital enhancements that he feels may be necessary to enhance the security of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3471)|
| 0:58:02| And anyway, he would like to discuss that with the Commission briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| And he's asked if he could do that possibly before the end of the meeting, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| just so we could get back to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We'll add that on as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| I'd like to add a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| As some of you may have seen in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| there's a company that's requesting to purchase some property out at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| There's a short timeline on which they need to act for their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| And I think out of fairness to this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| we can discuss some of the details that we need to get a sense as to whether this is something the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| wants to take up or not so this company can move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| and also before they pay some of the fees that are required before going to the NCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| Ultimately, it would come to us for a zoning change for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| But I think it's something that we need to discuss here both for the sake of the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| and also so if we're not interested in them being here, they can go someplace else to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| So that would be a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3544)|

| 0:59:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| Can I make that now or are you going to wait until the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| It does not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3565)|

| 0:59:45| So since we've got the school board people lined up with our commission now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| I think those are easier to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| So I'd like to have our 7th District attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=3591)|

| 1:08:46| 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| The law director mentioned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| We need to revisit Item 112, R-12-2-112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| We need to vote on those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| And also, Mr. Law Director, what about Rhonda Keyes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| It's my understanding she does not live in Commission Norman's District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| so she is not currently an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| So, I guess I need a motion to reconsider Item 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4153)|

| 1:09:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| So, I guess we're going to take Rhonda Keyes off and not consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| And Commission Norman is doing a diligent search to find a qualified person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| And we need to vote on Teresa Williams and Phyllis Nichols individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| So, do I hear a motion that Teresa Williams be named to the Charter Review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4173)|

| 1:09:35| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| And what about Phyllis Nichols?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Do we have a motion for Phyllis Nichols?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| And there's a motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4181)|

| 1:09:43| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| So, both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Yes, Commissioner McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| I think the proper pronunciation is Teresa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Oh, Teresa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Teresa Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| So, both of those individuals are approved for Charter Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| The next meeting is Wednesday at 5 o'clock here in this chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4194)|

| 1:11:32| so it would just be race and gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| The only records that we keep of disability have to do with the number of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| So, that's not going to be part of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| The number of spaces we have is 88, and that's all we know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| So, it's just going to be race and gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4309)|

| 1:12:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4368)|
| 1:12:59| Six and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Six and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| Well, that's it for our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Now we'll move into the discussion items, our first discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| Let's discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| This is a discussion regarding public hearings for billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| We had talked in our luncheon today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| We have a lot on our plate right now with the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| The budget is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| We want to make sure that when we have these hearings on the billboard situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| that we give it proper time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And representatives from the billboard industry were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| and they have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| And so we'd like to give everyone the opportunity to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| and be able to express their views on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| And so we ask that it take place in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| as opposed to trying to do it over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| So, Mr. Law Director, do I need to amend to do a vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| or do we just need to say we're going to hold the hearings in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| or revisit it in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| I would table it until a date is certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| So do I have a motion that we table that until and reconsider in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| So we will take up the issue again in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| Next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| The next discussion item is regarding the 9-1-1 data digital enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I will ask Director and former Chief of Police, Bob Coker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| to come and bring us up to date on the 9-1-1 situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| and thank you, Commissioners, for giving me a few minutes to explain what's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| My name is Bob Coker, 605 Barnard in Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| Brief history in 19 or, pardon me, 2005, when I came in midsummer, came to the 9-1-1 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4491)|
| 1:15:01| My first board meeting, I got hit with a few things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| namely that we were going to be bankrupt in two years and two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| We had zero employee raises over a vast amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| Turnover was 12% on a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Citizens and first responders, and when I say first responders, our police, sheriff's office, fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| were frustrated with the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Equipment was aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| There was no maintenance in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| First responders would not talk to 9-1-1 staff unless it was through a formal written correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4529)|
| 1:15:38| We go on and on with problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I won't bore you with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| And there was only one plan in place, and that's to stay out of bankruptcy, get things pulled together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| was to come to the city and the county, ask them for more money, and hire more staff each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| Seven years later, we are not bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Employee turnover is now zero or almost zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| We've trimmed our staff from 106 people down to 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| We've lowered our call answering time from an average of nine seconds down to 3.5 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| even though our call ratio has gone from 5.5 million up to 7 million calls a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| Police, fire, sheriff, administrators, their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| their employees now walk into the 9-1-1 center and talk face-to-face with our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| And complaints are down to 0.000176 last year on those $700,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4590)|
| 1:16:40| Thanks to our staff and managers, all that's been accomplished without coming to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| or the county for one extra penny since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| That's seven years without being back in front of this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| or coming in front of this group for the first time for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Ask them for more money, even though everything, wages, insurance, equipment, utilities, have all risen each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4615)|
| 1:17:04| Now, there's one thing that we cannot work harder or work smarter to overcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| and that's the aging condition of our radio equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Our radio equipment was established or the 9-1-1 system was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| or the 9-1-1 radio system was bought in 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| That's 26 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| It was updated in 1998, which was 14 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| So it's been in 24-7 operation for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| In late 2006, Motorola, our radio supplier, came to us and said we would be in non-support in early 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4653)|
| 1:17:43| Non-support meaning they could not get the parts, no longer manufacturing the parts to keep our system working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| I'm sorry I wasn't brave enough to say okay with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| and then come in front of county commission and city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| and ask them to come up with $16 to $20 million for a new radio system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| plus another $8 to $10 million for more radios for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| Working with our staff, Motorola, a number of other different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| I put together a plan where we went out and bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| and stockpiled essential equipment like controllers, logic boards, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| that will keep us running through 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| On top of this, the Federal Communication Commission stepped in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| and muddied the waters by saying they were reallocating spectrum or airways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| and due to increased demand driven by especially cell phones and data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| I went to our first responders, laid everything on the table for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| and told them that, you know, not only was our system dying because we can't replace it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| or replace all the parts in it, but also we're being hemmed in by the FCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| I asked them for their ideas of what they wanted their new radio system to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| and what they wanted to be capable of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| A number of items come forth, especially on the data side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| Ability to send building plans, subdivision plots, school plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| hazards to the police or fire personnel, live or recorded pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| the videos from eyewitnesses or pictures of offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| They also wanted to maintain and improve our current service levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| for the next wave of technology that we know is just over the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| None of this is possible with analog, but it is with digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| Analog right now we have 20 channels, 20 analog channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| Even if we could magically replace all those, we'd still end up with 20 channels of talk paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4783)|
| 1:19:52| And FCC has forbidden us or anybody else from adding more right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| With digital, what we're planning to go to, each one of those talk paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| those 20 channels, can be divided into four sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| And that way that allows us to use voice, data, video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| and any emerging technologies coming out over 80 different pathways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| Moving forward, each of our responder groups have some radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| and this is where it's going to be coming to be in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| is each of our responder groups, the police, the fire, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| have a number of digital capable radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Our plan, when I say our, 911, our first responders, CAT, the school systems, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| is to keep five of our channels analog and go with 15 digital channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| Some of the nonessential services, like our CAT services, some of the service department equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| crime scene personnel from the sheriff's department, some detention center personnel, and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| can transition over a period of years or a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| And that will reduce your initial budget impact that the sheriff's department is going to be approaching you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| Here in Knox County, first responders are basically driving a 1986 vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| with a 1998 motor in a Grand Prix race right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| They hold a dictate that they must win the race every time, every race, every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| And I cannot guarantee them that they're even going to have wheels or tires with the changes that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| A few years ago, FCC mandated that TV stations move from analog to digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Besides the mandate, why did the TV stations want to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| Simply, it lowered their costs over time, it expanded their capabilities greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| and it provided better service to the customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Bottom line, technology changes, expectations grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Like it or not, we're engulfed in that change right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| All of this is not our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| It's not 9-1-1's choice or the sheriff's or the police chief or the fire chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| 1986, zero percent of our calls coming into our center were from cell phones, zero percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| Today, out of the 700,000 calls, 80 percent of them are from cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Originally, if you all remember, if you're old enough like I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| you can remember they were hardwired into your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Either that or you carry a big briefcase around with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| Now, we know how small all the digital items are, all the cell phones, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| And could you imagine back in 86 or even 98 thinking how you could get through life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| if you only had your cell phone or your iPad with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| Today, it's the expected form of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| It's the way we talk to each other, the way we communicate, retrieve information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| send information, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Are these changes going to be costly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Yes, they will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Are these essential services, our police, our fire, our sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| Yes, they are essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| What happens if there's no changes coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| It's simply our system is dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| We can't give it any more transfusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| I've got all the essential equipment to keep it basically on life support through to 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| But we can't expend it forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| There's no one choice, but it's everyone's reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| In my humble opinion, and I think this is going to be coming from up in front of you from the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| I suggest a very focused and planned transition from the analog we have now to the digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5025)|
| 1:23:54| That will ensure the best service to our citizens at a reasonable cost in each step of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| rather than one big chunk payment in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| I appreciate you giving me time to try to explain what's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| And if you've got any questions, I'd be glad to try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Bob, can you give us an idea of what kind of cost we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| You mentioned phasing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Do you have any figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| No, sir, I do not for the sheriff, fire, or police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| There are radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| I know what it's going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| We are not going to be coming when I say we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| 9-1-1 is not going to be coming in front of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| but we are going in front of council on my watch saying we need money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| So we have actually got a technology fund right now to build this support system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| the backbone of the system itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Now, the individual radios that the officers carry and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| I cannot tell you what it's going to cost for each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| One quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Bob, do you know what portion of your budget is paid for by the 9-1-1 fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| that's on the phone bills and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| I mean, is it all of it or 90% of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It's the majority of it, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| A number of years ago, Commissioner, I would have said absolutely yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| Everyone right now is paying a phone charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| But back then, everyone had residential lines and business lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| Now that is on a continuous decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| So we're at about a break-even point right now in operation from landline tariffs or taxes coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| We've actually been losing money every year, and it's been at an increasing rate every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| There's no fee on the cell phone, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| There's no fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| It's so confusing, the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| You don't need to get me excited about that one because I've been fighting that since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| That money goes to the state of Tennessee, and they allocate it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| They say it's 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| We've sat down and figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| It's closer to 11 cents per cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| But they collect the money in Nashville, and then they, quote, distribute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Bob, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Appreciate the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Our next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| It's a discussion regarding the purchase of property at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| We have a representative here from the Development Corporation that would like to explain a little bit the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| and I think he could probably do a much better job of it than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| And, Todd, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| Todd Napier with Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Market Square, number 201, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| Just a little bit of background, and then, really, I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Bible to talk about her company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| But several weeks back, or some short time back, we were approached by a representative of a company called Katom on a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5213)|
| 1:27:04| And what they said to us, we're interested in the property that Development Corporation owns between Thorn Grove Pike and I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5224)|
| 1:27:13| And they were looking for that to locate their headquarters operation and their operations facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| And they'd been looking for quite some time, and we were aware of the company that they had been looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| and were primarily looking east of Knoxville, and they had been looking in Hambling County and Knox and Jefferson Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| But they said, you know, we believe that, you know, your site might be exactly what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| So we looked through that with them and then ultimately decided that that was something that they wanted to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5258)|
| 1:27:47| A little bit about Katom, you know, it's a company that represents, in my opinion, kind of the American dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| Once you get to know them and talk to them, it's about, you know, overcoming adversity, putting in a lot of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5273)|
| 1:28:02| And as a result, this company is growing and it's growing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| And, you know, I believe this is a company that any community would love to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| At the Development Corporation board meeting last Thursday, we made them aware, publicly aware about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5293)|
| 1:28:21| And Commissioners Briggs and Anders suggested that this commission meeting might be a good opportunity to introduce the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| and introduce Ms. Bible so that she could, you know, tell you a little bit about what it is they're planning to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| and background on their company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| So with that, I'm going to introduce Patricia Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| She is the CEO of Katom Restaurant Supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Thank you so much for allowing me to present my request to commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| and what our company is doing, where we've come from, where we expect to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| Twenty-five years ago, Katom was birthed in our garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| My husband and I started the company and very quickly moved it to a location in Russellville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| a small building that we purchased, and quickly the growth became very apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| We kept adding as long as we could until we absolutely became landlocked and could not add any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| That's about a 27,000-square-foot building at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| The company has continued to grow over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| In 2001, it took a tremendous redirection at the death of my husband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5377)|
| 1:29:45| and my position was to step in and decide let's go forward or let's go to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| But we had 17 single mothers and myself that worked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| And our decision as a family, my children at the time being 16 and 19 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| was to see the future of the company, give it 10 years, see what it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| If they had any interest to come back into the company, we would certainly continue the path that we had begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| And so started the quest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| And if anybody's ever lost someone they love, you can imagine you're pretty mad, pretty mad at a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| I was mostly mad at God, but he forgave me for being mad at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| So we took the company and quickly moved it from a $4 million company over the years until this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5428)|
| 1:30:36| We finished the year out at $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| Both children have now graduated from college, come back into the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| One's very powerfully entrenched in the Internet arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| The other is very entrenched in operations of the company, redefining processes, growing it to that next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5448)|
| 1:30:57| And we feel like we can be top ten in our country, in our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| And our goal is to be a $100 million company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| I think that based on our past that we certainly had the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| I know I had the staff to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| I had the desire, the dreams, and just a tremendous amount of direction from our entire team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5473)|
| 1:31:23| So the big question now is that we are totally forced to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| There's no space left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| There's nowhere else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| As we look at where to go, that brought on some challenges in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| Because of the Internet arm, we are actually bringing two people each weekend out of Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| That does some very particular programming for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| We also have three programmers that drive in every day from Knoxville, have Sevier County employees, Jefferson County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5509)|
| 1:31:59| And as we looked at that, we thought that it would be wise for the company in looking for those higher level employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5519)|
| 1:32:08| that we're going to need to continue this growth rate to kind of push toward a large university, such as University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5528)|
| 1:32:17| We've spoken to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| They have some wonderful opportunities that we feel like would be a good partnership for KTOM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| And we feel like just, I guess, as Bush Beans did when you guys maybe a decade ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| who knew Bush Beans and who knew Duke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Not a lot of people outside of East Tennessee, and now they're a national and international company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| We feel we can do the same with KTOM restaurant supply, that we can brand it in that kind of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Visibility is very important, getting that interstate presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| We've actually driven that I-81, I-40 corridor for the last 18 months, seeking, hunting, desiring that perfect location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5572)|
| 1:33:01| looking at Hamlin, Jeff, Knox County, and Sevier County, and have now talked to all four counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5581)|
| 1:33:10| And we feel like you all have the perfect fit, the perfect direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| We have a tremendous amount of people who are flying in and quite frequently use Tri-Cities because we're kind of between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5596)|
| 1:33:25| And sometimes those flights are a little difficult to bring in from across country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| where Knox County, McGee-Tyson certainly offers a better opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| And it's weekly that that happens, and usually multiple times a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| which also brings on need for lodging, food that they are always furnishing for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5620)|
| 1:33:48| and presentations that happen there at our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| How do we sustain this growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| It's been double digits now for a decade, and we think we can continue that based on the viability of our Internet sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5636)|
| 1:34:06| our government services arm, which is paired with we are a woman-owned company certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5646)|
| 1:34:14| Our international division, we have just really initiated this past year, very new at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| but it's growing much more rapid than we had expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Our contract division, another new arm that we just reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| and hired an employee in the last 18 months that is taking that to new heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| We've just finished our third nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| as well as have two other viable projects on the board that look like they have strong potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| So I think that kind of gives you a good overview of what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| and why we're wanting to make this move and hoping to pair with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| and be a great companion as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| Well, let me say that I'm glad that you've chosen Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| You've chosen well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| So it just shows how smart you are, and so we're just glad that you're approaching us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| I've got the newspaper article that you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I read that yesterday and I'm tickled for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| It's an all-women's place, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| You need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| I'm just curious on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| The land that you're looking at is undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| There's not a business parking thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| And we have other parks that we have empty, vacant buildings and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Have you gone and looked at that, or is it just the interstate exposure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| Are you wanting the exposure to the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Is that what you're after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| We're looking at interstate exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Exit 8, as you know, where they're redoing that exit, they have a parcel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| The 417, there's also one in the 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| This one just gets it a little bit closer to the amenities that we need for the people that we're really looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| to grow the business from the standpoint of the airport, the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| different chefs that we fly in across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| Yeah, I see how your business is moving up because everybody eats out all the time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| I mean, your business is really booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| But I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| I would think there would be some major deals that could be struck with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| from the other industrial parks that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| You pick where you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| I trust your research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Well, and it is the interstate presence that is so powerful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| When you think there's well over a million cars that are passing that every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| and to see that KTOM sign and to know that we're there, we're in their face constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5802)|
| 1:36:49| Yes, we have that internet presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| but to have that visual of all contact we feel would be just powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| Have you tried Broadway at 640?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| The 640 building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| You mentioned chefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| That would indicate food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| So if you ever have any need for people to come and sample, we are, you know, we like to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| How many employees do you have now that you said that I missed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| We have grown from 17 in 2001 to 62 at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| Sixty-two at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| And literally could hire between 10 to 15 if we had another desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| and another small space to put someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| But we're just totally out of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| If you build this complex that you're talking about here, how many would that employ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| It would start, of course, with the 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| But within the year we feel confident that we will be near 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| And you're the only hiring women?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| I'll let my son come on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| We have a lot of male employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| I have a question for Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Where did he get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| This is part of the original controversial park project out there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| Yes, this part is 380 acres that we own out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| It's a fringe part of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| It's the closest part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| It's the part closest to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| So what is the development corporation's position at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| Are you waiting for us to give you the go-ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Are you talking about on this particular piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Well, what's going to happen, the development corporation is going to meet on Thursday of this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| to consider entering into a sales agreement with T&B Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| This is buying the property, but for KTOM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| And then they'll have a due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| So they'll be back for a rezoning on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Mr. Shouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| I'm thinking of a few of the issues when we all went through the midway situation 14 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5945)|
| 1:39:13| The TVA power line is going everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Is that a factor to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| Do you remember the substation and all that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| No, we have walked the property, looked at the lay of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| and I've seen no issues with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| How about infrastructure or lack of infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| Is that critical to anything that can be installed reasonably?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| We understand that all of that would be within a doable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| You have your own package plant then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| You wouldn't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| I mean, sewer is not an issue then, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| No, sewer is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Sewer would not be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Neither is water or power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| We've researched all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| I want to just shed a little bit more light on why we brought this up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| and I think we've heard just an excellent presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| This is like the American dream story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| and it seems like certainly this is the kind of business that we would like to welcome to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| But the reason I brought this up today is, and I don't think this has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| is that you're on a rather short timeline of when you need to get this thing done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| because you're so tight for space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| And the reason I wanted us to bring this up today is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| that this has to go through the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| It would involve a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| And I think, out of fairness to the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| is that they needed to have a sense from this community, do we want to support them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| Because if they go through the process, I mean, they need to get into a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| and get back to work and start growing wherever they decide to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| But we needed to get a sense from this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| is this the type of business that we want to welcome into Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Because I think if it isn't and when the zoning comes up for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| if we're going to say no and we don't want you here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| you'd really like to hear it right now before you go through a long and involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| And because you do have to go through the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I think there has to be both a zoning change and a sector plan change with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| Then it would have to come back to the county commission to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| And if we're going to deny that, I think it would really be helpful to the company up front to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| so they can go someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| And that's part of the reason I wanted to bring this up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| is if we could give them a sense that we're going to be a lot of opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| And I think you've been explained the situation by the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| But if it's something that's just flat out not going to fly, I think for the sake of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| they would like to know right now they need to go someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| Well, I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| I'm just one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Yeah, just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Based on our past experience with this, have you met with any of the groups in that area out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| the homeowner's groups or associations out there yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| No, sir, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| I wasn't aware of this problem until just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| But I feel like we are a great fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| We're a good presentation for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| And I would certainly welcome the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| It might be best, of course, it's still your decision whether to buy or not buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| but it might be best to try to schedule a meeting there with the community as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6154)|
| 1:42:43| I think, as Dr. Briggs mentioned, what we're looking for is to know if you all are welcoming of our company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6163)|
| 1:42:51| so that we would know whether to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| Thank you, Ms. Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| You are very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Your company is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| Thank you for your interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| That was along my question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| You live in Jefferson County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| No, sir, I live in Hamlin County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| So you haven't been aware at all of the Civil War that took place at Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| No, but I hear it was rather powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| But, you know, a smile can do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Well, that's just, you know, our concern certainly would have to address some of the people that live in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6205)|
| 1:43:33| and have fought that fight for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| So I hope that you can, just as Commissioner Brown said, see if you can contact them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| and have some kind of dialogue with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| The NPC folks could help you with that, or Todd, I'm sure you could too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| Any other questions or anything else, Todd, you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Again, we appreciate your interest in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Now, what is our next discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Our next discussion item is regarding discharges of firearms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| At our work session last week, I brought this issue forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| saying that I would like to have a conversation amongst commissioners about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| or not we can do anything about a complaint from a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| You received the letter, Commissioner Shoust and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| speaking to the fact that there had been a complaint to the sheriff's office about discharged firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| Since then, I think I've made sure that everyone got a copy of the citizen's letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6281)|
| 1:44:49| and then the determinations as made by the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| I don't know whether or not there's enough sentiment amongst commission to move forward with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6294)|
| 1:45:02| It does look to me like there could be some grounds for some safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| but reading the Chief Ruble's estimate of the situation, as far as state law is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6308)|
| 1:45:17| most of everything is reserved to their purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| I believe that's also what we received from the law director at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6321)|
| 1:45:29| Really, I'd like to see if anyone has any other comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| If I could, Mr. Chairman, unless the Commissioner wants to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| I followed up that same day with an email to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| But just so you know, and I think with Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| it's always admirable to look out for the health, welfare, and safety of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| Tennessee Code 3917.13.14 reads that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| although a county may prohibit possession of handguns within parks and greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| it does specifically say that no county shall occupy any part of the field of regulation of the transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| ownership, possession, transportation of firearms, ammunition, or components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| or firearms or combinations, therefore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| And it said this is a prospective ordinance, or rather a statutory enactment from 1986 forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6375)|
| 1:46:25| Pretty much preempts the whole regulation using possession of firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6385)|
| 1:46:33| The challenge you have, of course, is for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| You know, if someone's in the backyard and they've made a makeshift range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| as long as they're not endangering the health, welfare, and safety of someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| law enforcement hands are pretty much tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| You have to show reckless endangerment, assault, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| So you are very restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| And anything you pass that's, of course, in contravention of this is subject to challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| and most likely would prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| But again, that's the hand you've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| You've got a very restrictive statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| And that's from the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| What you read is the state law, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| That's the Tennessee Code section 3917.13.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| It basically reads local regulation of firearms and ammunition preempted by state regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| That doesn't pertain to incorporated areas, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| Like, is that why the city of Knoxville is so much more restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| Well, actually, it says no city, county, or metropolitan government can involve themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| in the regulation, transfer, ownership, or possession of firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| It's very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| But it does include basically all political subdivisions of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| So then you can shoot your gun in the city and it's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| I was under the impression that was much more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| Where some municipalities have had some luck in some states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| and not really in Tennessee, is relying on a noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| But even then, it's restrictive from a certain time to a specific time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| Many states have very restrictive regulations on local regulation of firearms for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| But in Tennessee, it's one of the more restrictive in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| I concur with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| I don't know the answer, but maybe it's a tighter enforcement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| Of course, that's more the sheriff's decision than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| But the constituents I've talked to, a firearm was discharged in a vacant lot in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| There's 40 houses and two vacant lots, and then someone starts shooting a gun in one of the vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| and bullet ricochets here and there and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| It scares me that someone could be injured in that type of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| And I am not one to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| I totally respect the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| and I respect our Constitution and support our Constitution and that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| In our race, I agree with people's right to bear arms and keep arms and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| As a matter of fact, the people that have called me, I believe, have guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| and were former military guys and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| But they just said that we're worried somebody's outside with a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| and the kids are scared and running to the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| And to me, it just worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| And I think, again, I know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| I'm groping for something to say or a thought to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| I support some type of tighter restriction on it if possible, if it's just through the enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| I'll go down on the boat with mine, but I still think that the responsibility, bottom line is, rests with the shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6577)|
| 1:49:47| They have to be responsible in where they're shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| So somewhere along the way, if there's some miscommunication on what is safe and what isn't safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6593)|
| 1:50:02| then maybe a new set of rules or the rules need to be brought out and published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| so that people know what's safe and what's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| Like Commissioner Schall said, you know, people don't realize how bullets can ricochet around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| but it still comes back to the shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| Well, I'd like to extend just a little bit on what Commissioner Brown just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| It's not necessarily what the shooter think is dangerous, but it's what the law enforcement people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| the laws are pretty clear, is if someone's at risk from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| if it's causing endangerment to someone, it has to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| And I think everyone would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| Now, what happens is that that's up to the interpretation of the law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| that comes out there and investigates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| I guess one of my questions would be to the law director, and it's not too specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| but if a citizen actually disagreed with what endangerment consists of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| would he have the right or the privilege to take that to a court and let the judge hear the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| or is it still left at the discretion of the investigating officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| Well, sir, if an investigating officer goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| and determines that there's no reckless endangerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| there's nothing to preclude a citizen from filing an injunction against another private citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| How the court will review that, you know, the first person they'll call as a witness most likely is the law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| But, I mean, a person can always file a private nuisance action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| I couldn't predict, you know, how a court would rule on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| You know, my opinion is that this is not something we're going to be able to legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| because it involves so much judgment by, you know, by an investigating officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| You know, I think the thing that everyone, every single person, including people that would be firing like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| every responsible person would be, is that you don't want to endanger anyone with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| But, you know, and then sometimes the complaints are filed by people who just don't like people shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| It doesn't matter where they're shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| And it sounds to me like the state law makes it pretty clear what can be done and not be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| And the rest of it involves, you know, it really involves judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I would, quite frankly, be opposed for us to try to do anything more with this because I think everything's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| and you just can't legislate judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Mr. Rubel, did you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| In addition to what the law director indicated with regard to any citizen that feels like the officer has not proceeded as much as he can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| he can go directly to the magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| It is a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| He can go directly to the magistrate, present his evidence to the magistrate like this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| That's what I said in the end of my memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| He could take the pictures of wherever it was he said the rounds were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| and take it to the magistrate and say this is from this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| So it doesn't stop with the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| Obviously, officers are trained to determine whether or not this conduct is reckless or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| But if there is something that if you simply disagree with the officer, that's not the end of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| You can go to civil court, as Joe suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| but you can also go to the magistrate's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| And if the magistrate disagrees with the officer, then the magistrate can go ahead and swear out the warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| and off you go into the criminal side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| I just wanted to explain that to say that there are still two avenues that are open to any citizen that feels wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| But in general, Joe's comments are exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| The law does frown on local regulation of firearms stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| It makes it very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Mr. Hornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| I agree with Dr. Briggs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| I think our hands are kind of tied here, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| I mean we're starting to step on trying to change state law, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| I think the reason in the city you don't hear of guns being fired and stuff is because you've got houses 20 yards behind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6824)|
| 1:53:54| or 50 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| So you are going to endanger somebody if I go out in my backyard and start shooting a firearm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| So it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| So that's why I don't think they haven't the city hasn't made any new laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| They're just the police, if they get called out for something like that, is going to see that as endangering people around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| So when you're in the county, it's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| You've got a little broader area to shoot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| I haven't seen this area, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| From what I'm assuming, it's a safe environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| The sheriff patrolmen that went out there declared that he's shooting it safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| and he's not endangering anybody around him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| So I just think that we're kind of stepping in areas that we don't need to be in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| Different subject before we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| Is this all on this discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| Commissioner Norman had brought up at our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| and it was not on the agenda today, about our workshop at the schools, and he wanted to address us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| I just, when we had our retreat, one of the outstanding or the memorable things that I got from it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6899)|
| 1:55:11| as the school system addressed us at the beginning of the retreat during our dinner the first night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| what I noticed was there was a distinct effort by Mr. Thomas to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6918)|
| 1:55:29| or make the point that this notion that's very, very old and tends to crop up every time in a budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6929)|
| 1:55:38| that our central office administration is bloated or too large or overfunded or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6938)|
| 1:55:46| that that's a faulty statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| And for me and for a lot of teachers, this has been a statement or a hypothesis that has been out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6951)|
| 1:56:03| and we've tried to address for at least 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| And I uncovered an article that I'll probably put in your box that was written in 1994 by one of the local newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6968)|
| 1:56:20| kind of a weekly newspaper, and I think it was Phil Hamby wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| And anyway, this is an idea that as we start into the budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| and we start to plan for our next meeting with the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| it just seems like it's just a huge topic just because the central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=6996)|
| 1:56:44| someone from central office basically, a person that works for central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| says that it's not true that we have a bloated bureaucracy in central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| I think we need more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| I think we need data to disprove that notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| I don't think we've ever had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| And we're not talking about number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| Last year I had an email confrontation somewhat with Dr. McIntyre over that MMLM report, which was quite old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7027)|
| 1:57:19| So we've got, you know, the numbers that vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| You know, essentially the central office says we have a staff of this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| and then there's a lot of people that think it's something like three to four to five times larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| than the stated number of people that are in central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| So, and right before our new Mayor Burchett was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| one of his platforms for his campaign was that in discussing budget items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| we need a dual budget, a dual budget that represents the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| One, that what is the budget, the operating costs of the central office, the A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| and then what does it cost us to run these schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| And so these are, it's a very difficult thing to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| It's not, I think in theory it's a simplistic notion to try to divide to have a dual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7092)|
| 1:58:21| I think it would be very helpful for us to address that or at least talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| It's a historical issue that's never been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| And I don't know how to go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| It might be an item on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| It is related to a lot of political activity that's been taking place in terms of the school system here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7118)|
| 1:58:47| But it's something that I think is essential as we go forward and discuss budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| and 60-something percent of our budget is devoted to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| So, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| And I was hoping that people would chime in a little bit related to that when I brought it up at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| But I didn't get many people that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| I think Commissioner Wright was before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| Did you want to talk about something differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| Okay, no, this has to do with what Tony talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| Yeah, you know, I think that really would be good if we could get someone to get some objective analysis of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7160)|
| 1:59:28| are we too big, are we too small, are we just right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| This is one of those things that this room, I'm not going to say rumor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| but this issue has been floating out there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| And I think the study that Commissioner Norman is talking about was done quite a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7177)|
| 1:59:44| and it was probably, like a lot of things, it was probably misquoted by people that had never read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| And it needs to be, I think it needs to be updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| and let's just get this issue settled once and for all because it really has been a hang-up about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| If we've got a problem, we need to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| If we don't have a problem, then let's move on and talk about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| Commissioner McKenzie, do you want to talk about the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| I guess either I'll dovetail on what Commissioner Norman was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| or maybe muddy the water a little, and that is there's been a lot of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| In fact, next Monday, I think there's an open discussion on the teacher evaluation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7221)|
| 2:00:29| with this whole race to the top funding comes greater accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7229)|
| 2:00:35| and a greater responsibility is actually inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| Those building-level administrators are evaluating the teachers, grading them one through five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7238)|
| 2:00:47| And if we're doing that, and we're doing that well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| and we have this other central office function that might be evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| how does that dynamic work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Are we kind of changing the paradigm now that we're doing this thing a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| And we can take another look at those central office numbers based on the fact that they're getting two good looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7266)|
| 2:01:13| or three good looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| I don't know how often they're evaluated, but there's a comprehensive, pretty detailed evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| So how does that affect the numbers as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| So, again, I don't know if I'm complimenting or muddying the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| but I do think this is a really good dialogue for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| And we need to, you know, it would behoove us to dig into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120227?start=7290)|
