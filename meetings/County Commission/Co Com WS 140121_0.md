| 0:00:39| Commissioner Schell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| Ten members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Commissioner Longby, will you lead the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| Please stand, give the proper salute to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=53)|
| 0:01:08| All right, do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| The discussion item that I've got, a number of teachers would like to come, so I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| hope we could put that off the discussion until next week and possibly to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| pass 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| After 430, should be able to get teachers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| By that time, their contract is 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| All right, they currently only have four things on off-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| So do you want to try to come back at 430 for zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| I mean, adjourn the meeting and come back at 430?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Because we're going to be done before 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Yeah, if we could take a recess until 430, or just to allow them time to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| With a small fee, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| We'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Yes, 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| And we're not going to discuss it today, though, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| I'd like to bring up a discussion item, and this is probably the venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| We'll have to carry it over to next week, but just to talk about how we put discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| items on and this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Just on what Commissioner Norman was saying, there's three resolutions that we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| going to do at 445.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| So if we do those maybe at 430, and then we can do the discussion right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| I think we've got to get the football teams here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=164)|

| 0:02:55| Did you get that, Jolene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| In light of the fact that I have a son at West High School, I'd like to co-sponsor the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=186)|

| 0:03:10| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| I'd like to add a brief discussion item about the Telecommunications Committee for NACo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| I'm a state member of that, and I just want to brief the Commission on what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=198)|

| 0:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Anybody here from Parks and Rec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Doug, do you want to add this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| I'm trying to make sure that I get it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Is that an odd number, 704?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Jill gave it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| It's the Blount Greenway, the Knox Blount Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| You want to make sure that's added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| 704 will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| I need to postpone number 33 for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Until the March meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| If we have it next month, we'll bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| But we're still going to meet with some more property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| 33, you want to just do 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| That way, if we get it complete, we can have it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Commissioner Norman, you still have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=265)|

| 0:04:37| Not a very good team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=277)|

| 0:04:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Discussion item on the disposal sale of the former convenience center, Tazewell Pike, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=295)|
| 0:05:05| I need a motion to add, defer, withdraw, and delay all that's been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=313)|

| 0:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| I sent an e-mail with the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| And it would be easier, I guess, to say the things that are not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| 29, 30, 32, and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| Is there anything anybody would like to pull from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| 29, 30, 32, and 34 are not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=355)|
| 0:06:08| Is everybody good with the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Can I have a motion to set the consent agenda, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=382)|

| 0:06:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=389)|
| 0:06:50| First item is item number 29 on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| This is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| to accept from Southeastern Housing Foundation II, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes with respect to property located at 101 East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| also known as the historic Knoxville High School, Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Is there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Chris, do you mind to come down or purchasing either one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| Is this very similar to a pilot or it is a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| It is a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| From here it will go to IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Basically, this would be a pilot of no more than $18,500 for no less than 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=458)|
| 0:07:50| and no more than 15 years, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Todd is still running the numbers and so we give that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Currently, we get zero for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| I think anything is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| It is just part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| If you all approve this pilot, then it goes to IDB for their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| That is how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Chris, I just want to know how you arrived at $18,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| $18,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| I let Todd kind of speak to that and Grant is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| I think it is a number that we all came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| I am not 100% for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| I am going to let Grant answer that because I think that was part of their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| I am happy to answer any questions related to the process or steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Grant Rosenberg, Southeastern Housing Foundation, 901 East Summit Hill, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| As Todd mentioned, Todd alluded to, this is the figure that was in our proposal that we submitted back in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| We think that number is still going to hold true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| And the way we arrived at it is we tried to identify where the gap was in financing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| and getting this project done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| And where we arrived at that gap is the gap is between the amount in which we need to achieve an adequate loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=556)|
| 0:09:25| to value to be eligible for financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| So right now I believe the IDB Development Corporation is running these numbers through a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| And I'll let Todd, if he wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| But we have an IDB application review committee next week and an IDB meeting next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| and they'll further refine that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| But we feel our number is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| I think also the property assessor's office has looked at the value of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| So, again, we want to be able to achieve enough loan to value to qualify for financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| And the way we appraise our value on an income-producing property is we look at our NOI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=595)|
| 0:10:03| our net operating income, and we calculate that using a cap rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| And that's where we found our gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| And that's how we arrived at the 18-5 figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| And we think for 15 years that's we hope for 15 years because that's going to be the term of both the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| and our CITC loan, our financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| So that's the extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| The cap is 18-5 and 15 years is the extent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| So no more than 18-5 and no more than 15 and no less than 10 and no more than 18-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| We've got one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| The next item is on Page 9, Item No. 30, Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| It's No. 1, directing the Knox County Finance Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| subject to Knoxville City Council's action of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| put a hold on implementing the city-county building garage monthly parking rate increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| effective January 1, 2013, to $60 for Knox County employees paying the full rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| and $30 for those employees paying the 50% rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| And No. 2, requesting the city-county PBA parking committee to reconvene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| subject to Knoxville City Council's action of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| as recommended in the city-county PBA parking committee report dated May 18, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| to review the parking rate and structure and other matters affecting parking policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| and submit its findings and recommendations to the county commission, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| board of education, and PBA board of directors for their consideration and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Mr. Law Director, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Inaction on this item would effectively raise the property parking rates, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| Well, whatever you all decided to do as far as the parking rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| I think what happened was they were going to do some kind of review as it related to handicap parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| and some review related to the employees' amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| I don't think any decision was made, and it was deferred until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| What we did was put it back on the agenda just like it was back when you deferred it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| So any amendment or anything you all want to do with it, it's kind of open however you want to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| If you want to act on it, amend it, just, you know, whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| So it depends on what you do and what motions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| So passing this as is would continue the current parking rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| and ask them to reconvene the committee if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| I had a conversation recently with Jim York from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| and we both thought it would be a good idea to maybe defer this again until September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| We have saw our number, the county's number of handicap spots drop from like 130 down to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| I can't tell you what caused the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| I have an idea, but I won't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| And also, I think there is probably in the next three or four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| there will be some clarification as to handicap parking in this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| and I think that will answer a lot of our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| And once that happens, I think we can move forward and decide what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| I think we take this into consideration as we do the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Whatever the rate is, whether, you know, the city and the county want to stay at the same rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| but whatever money comes in through the county comes back to the county, and the city keeps their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| PBA does manage the facility, and basically we basically just put a holding pattern on the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=844)|
| 0:14:15| It was a two-pronged approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| It was supposed to go from 30 to 35, then from 35 to 47.50, then 47.50 to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=857)|
| 0:14:26| So there's just been a hold between to hold it to 47.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| until we try to address the issue as related around handicap parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| And I think that will be done, but it's just going to take a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| I guess my question, I don't think we've met as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| This is not part of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I don't think the committee has met since we were 19 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| Do we need to put some verbiage in there if we pass it to say that this committee will have to be reconstituted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| At least from our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| I don't know about the city, but I think it would from our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| If we still have a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| I can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| If we still have a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| I'm like Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I don't remember this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| And if, you know, we need to designate a committee to get this done to work with the city on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| But if Chris says, you know, we're going to defer it until September, it's not a big rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| I think the legislative session is why the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| We're going to have some answers to our question in the legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| And as far as the committee is concerned, at the time Commissioner Smith was on the committee and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| and there's some people from the city and there was a citizen representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| And I think, and I think Del Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I think Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Was Commissioner Harmon, former Commissioner Harmon on that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| May have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I do know that I think Del Smith from PPPBA has the mindset that unless there needs to be changes to what the committee recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=952)|
| 0:16:05| then we can reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| If it's just a rate issue, it's more of a city, county decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Chris, how long have we been to 4750?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| 4750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Let me think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Is this our third year at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| I think the first year went from 30 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| And I think this would be the second year at 4750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Do you not think that the committee needs to go ahead and meet and be ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| I mean, if you're waiting on the legislature, the legislature is going to have their answer by April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| What's the legislature got to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Where do they fill in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I think the legislature is going to help us with our answer to handicapped parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| They've got to pass a special law for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| Do you foresee that we could still go ahead and do what we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| And then handicapped is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Five percent of what we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Five to ten percent of the total parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| What's the percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| It was a pretty good chunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| I mean, it came down some, but to say it won't spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| I mean, it fluctuates a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| And what happens is those people who are deemed to be handicapped parkers don't pay anything by state law, by TCA code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| And so we're trying to address that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| And, you know, I think waiting until September is the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| Because if we go ahead and do something and they don't do what we think they're going to do, then it could put us in flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1050)|
| 0:17:39| I think it's best just to wait and then address the issue again in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| We need to hear from Dale Smith, what his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| I mean, I think what Dale's going to say is kind of what he said the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| The rates, you know, had a set schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| But since there was a hold put on it by city council and county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| that whenever they seem to want to raise it, then we'll raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| I think his viewpoint is just from the operational procedures what was determined by that committee was the committee's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1088)|
| 0:18:17| They did set prices well, but that can be, you know, held in flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And so I think that's what he would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| I don't want to speak for him, but I think that's what he would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| I mean, if he's happy holding it until September, then that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Chris, what do employees pay to park in Dwight Castle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| That would be $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| And I would say that the city has said that we could park at the Coliseum for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| and then you would take the trolley over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Or you could walk if you want to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| There's a trolley that goes from the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| So you do have some differing price structures there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| That's $1.25 a day at Dwight Castle, what it comes out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Chris, could we hear it in August as opposed to September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| That's perfectly fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| The reason I say that is some of us won't be here in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| And I know Commissioner Smith was on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| And I think it would be good to have that knowledge of the committee while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And anyway, I'm just saying that if we could do it before September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| you'll have some new people here who are not going to have this knowledge of why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| And if it doesn't matter, I'd like to ask that it be heard in August as opposed to September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Is that a motion to defer until August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I'll make that as a motion that we do it in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| We have a motion with a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| To defer until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| The next item is on page 10, item number 32, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| It's approving a contract in the amount not to exceed $170,000 with databank IMX LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| for the development, installation, and maintenance of an electronic content management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| for the Circuit Court Clerk's Office, funded through the Circuit Court Clerk's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| accrued collections of the state-mandated technology fee from court users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1229)|
| 0:20:40| I'm Kathy Shanks, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| I'm the Circuit Civil Sessions and Juvenile Court Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| And I didn't call all of you and tell you about this because I tend to put you to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| while I'm simultaneously confusing you and boring you when I speak to you about these sorts of topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| This fund started accumulating in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| The legislature gave us the opportunity to tack on a $2 fee with each and every new filing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| And that fee was sunned down in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| So we started accumulating these fees in 2001 and amassed about $162,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| which we paid over to the general fund to be held for clerk technology only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| Every clerk across the state was authorized to collect those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and that was what was to be done with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| It was very broadly written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| It could be spent for consultants, for hardware, software, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| But because counties tend to want to build roads, pay for education, public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| clerks are kind of far down on the needs list, and I think they saw the need to move the courts forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| And so they gave us a window of time to build up some money for our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| But it dived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| So, you know, it sat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| And when I saw that opportunity to collect those funds, I wanted to do something systemic with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| I didn't want to buy a laptop here and, you know, a couple of printers there and watch it burn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| I wanted to have the opportunity to use the funds for a larger impact for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| And I thought, well, if technology in this area is like anything else, it's eventually going to become cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| So we let it sit and we waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Every couple of years I'd call Dick Morrell and say, Dick, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| You know, scanners, scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Well, the legislature saw fit to reenact the same fee and give it back to the clerks effective 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| And so I waited about a year to see at what rate we would generate funds again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| And it looks like we're generating them in the $30,000 to $40,000 a year range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| We've presently amassed $69,347.50 to add to the $162,000, which is what has brought us to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1378)|
| 0:23:14| I called Dick Morrell back about 18 months ago and said, Dick, you know, here's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| And he said, you know, I think we might be able to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| And with Randy Kenner on my end of the committee and Dave Ball and Sean and Dick's guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| we started an 18-month process of hammering out the concept and where we wanted to go with a document imaging system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| for storage and retrieval to make a more efficient system, more cost-effective system for Knox County courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| And what we were looking at was the piece for the case management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| We already have a fine case management system that was designed in-house by our IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| We don't need that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| We just needed the scanning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| And so that's the part we're looking at, and we're looking at it in two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| What we need to do is use the funds we've got to buy servers, do our retrieval and storage, work through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| work through that from a work culture standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| The next phase is to look at putting it up on the Internet, devising a subscription service that will hopefully generate funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| and, you know, we can sell those documents, create a library, sell those documents to lawyers, and keep it funded as this statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| also becomes sundown and we may not have it after about 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| I'll double-check the sundown date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| But that's why the press forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| But this software is compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| That was part of the rigorous screening with IT on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| We wanted to make sure that it would be compatible for all of the clerks on the gym systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| It's a type of software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| It's a product that could be used at juvenile court, although additional licenses would have to be purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| But we wanted to make sure that it could be used universally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Can we get a motion on the floor first before we discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I've got a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| So what's the current fee once the sun rolls on it again and you start back assessing this fee to each case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1517)|
| 0:25:26| Two dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| So I'm just trying to figure out how you got an odd number and change when you're assessing at a two-dollar rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| I'd have to ask my bookkeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| I don't know how she ended up with 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Like seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| So I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Is it an interest-bearing account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| That may be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Next up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Item number 34, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| It's approving the recommendations of the Knox County Audit Committee as approved at the audit committee meeting on January 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| 2014 relative to the engagements of the Knox County Internal Auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| I'd like to make a motion that we pass this without recommendation just due to the fact that it's quite a large information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| And then we'll move it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Do you mind if I ask Andrew to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| This is a consolidation of what we, we being the audit committee, myself, Commissioner Broyles and Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| and Joe Carcello, there's four of us on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| There will hopefully soon be five again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| And it's, bottom line, some efficiencies to the audits, some audits that were in process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| and have been in process for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And the two that jump out at me the strongest as being ones that are not that necessarily productive to our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| is an audit of fixed assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I mean, that's an audit of, I read one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| It was Bearden Middle School was on Middlebrook Pike and Francis Drive, and it's valued at $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| And, I mean, it's good stuff, but it's not really anything that's, nobody's going to steal Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| I mean, it's not anything that's any great risk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| And I think this is just a way to move that forward and do more productive things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| And the other, which may be a little controversial, we all, some of us are commissioners, some of us were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| but we went through the lobster lunches and the P cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and a lady, I think, charged her cruise on the P card, and it took six months to find it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| Well, we had some debate at the audit committee back last year, early part of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| and there were like a dozen exceptions to the audit report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| I mean, and management disagreed with 11 of them, which is just, never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| Usually you may have 10 sections, and the management always agrees with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| and they have a response to it, and they're going to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| And this was because the previous office was auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| And, again, it's a worthwhile cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| But if you look at the risk and reward, our maximum exposure to losing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| somebody taking a P card and charging a cruise is $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Well, that's a lot of money, and that's, the county could, in theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| lose $5,000 if somebody charges something they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| But on the other side of the income statement, I guess would be the form, you just heard, what, an hour or 50 minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| you heard Chris out there say we're going to get a $400,000 rebate from those cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| And I asked Hugh Holt out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I had the figure in my mind of $1.4 million in savings, back office savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| and he told me that was in excess of $2 million now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| And he said he can, in essence, quantify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| So you look, are you going to save $2 million in back office expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| and a $400,000 hard money rebate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| And on the other side, you might, worst case scenario, lose $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| And so, I'm sorry I made that such a long story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| but we're hopefully going to move that off the stove or off the, even beyond the back burner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| just move it on and basically keep tabs on it, but not worry about auditing those individual cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| and making such a big deal out of the exposure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| The risk-reward is just so much greater to move away from it and keep that in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| and let Andrea's time be spent more productively elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| Do you want to comment on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Maybe if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Did I misread it or read too much into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| And on the electronic commerce cards, there's some things we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| If that's of interest to continue to monitor some of that, we can build in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Right now it's a very manual system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| We can do some electronic database pulls to automatically just push a button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| pull down some reports, and then have that information available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| without having a manual review monthly of those purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| So if we want to continue to do that, there's some ways we can improve the efficiency of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| to do those, to give that information more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| And there was one or two other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I don't have an iPad with me that we were addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| The red book and yellow book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| The red book, yellow book, and you've sent us some information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| We are currently required under our ordinance to follow both sets of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| so that requires the office to be in full compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Well, that would be our goal, to be in full compliance with both sets of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| And the Audit Committee asked me to do some research on Davidson, Shelby, and Hamilton counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| to see what they were using in their standards, and they're using only yellow books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| So it would be the precedent could be there to just go back to just yellow book requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| just the government auditing standard requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Ms. Andrea, would it be possible that you pull your mic down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| I'm resting on the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| My breakfast got in the way of my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| This week, before next week's meeting, that you could e-mail us a copy of these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| that you will be presenting next Monday for us to look over before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| I believe they're in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| They're in the packet, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| They're in the resolution packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| We'll make sure you get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| We have a motion to defer these until the next meeting without recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| so everybody can have a chance to continue to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=1941)|

| 0:35:48| She mentioned something the way whether our new auditor should attend all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| And she said she didn't think it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| And some other commissioners were there, and they said it was necessary, they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So I'd rather her be here before we discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| I think we had a few discussion items that were added, so we'll go through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| One is discussion regarding placing discussion items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| And, you know, this is, to be quite honest, I was sitting at a meeting, and, you know, this particular one kind of came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| And it had really strong language, and it's the language about the teacher revolt, whether it's a revolt or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| And I guess that's what we'll discuss next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| But, you know, I do think, you know, we've generally placed things on the agenda, but it, you know, could be problematic, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2193)|
| 0:36:45| And I think there probably needs to be some kind of, you know, vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| I mean, to be quite honest, if I put something on that's maybe, you know, racially charged, that would be very insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| I mean, to bring it up before we even have a conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| So things like this, I think it's just, I don't know how to get to it, because one person's, you know, inflammatory statement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2218)|
| 0:37:08| another person's regular conversation, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| But, you know, I think this particular one tended to incite and end up being a headline before we even talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| Now that headline is a couple of weeks old, a week old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So I'm trying to figure out what the best way is that we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| And I don't want to stifle anyone, but by the same token, you know, we're going to discuss something that's now an issue before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| even had a chance to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| So just for conversation is why I'm bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| You know, I think something that I really appreciate what you say with that, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| You know, something that I think would be helpful to us is that, and I've followed all this with, you know, the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| and the schools and the criticisms and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| But I wish someone could give us, and I try to be very careful of us not crossing the line when we get into school board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| But I still think that it would be helpful if someone could give us a briefing over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| it really is the lines of authority on things that are occurring, what are federally mandated regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| what are state and what are local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| So we're going to discuss that at the retreat as one of our top items of discussion at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| Yeah, well, I think that would be very good because I know sometimes we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| we've brought up things here before and I'm not, you know, picking on anything about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| federal gun legislation and, you know, whether we should bomb Syria or not or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| You know, it's completely out of our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| But, you know, when we do listen to things, it's what I tell constituents sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| There's things that we can help with and we can do things about and then there's things that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| And I think it would be helpful just to clarify where some of the complaints, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| that we're hearing from teachers and students and parents and other officials even, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| that really fall into things that we or that even the school board can do anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| because we are asked questions just like the school board are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Yeah, that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| It's going to be a discussion at the school board commission retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Let's get off my button again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| This body a lot of times discusses items that while we might not be able to have a lot of control over them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2368)|
| 0:39:39| the discussions that we bring out bring out facts that the public needs to know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| so the public can make decisions when it comes time for voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| And I think this is one of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| From what I've been reading, we get, without getting into this discussion, just to give you one example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| we get results saying one thing when in turn when you turn it around it actually says something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| So I think healthy discussions with this body were that certainly the public is probably more listening to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2408)|
| 0:40:17| than they are to the school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I don't know what the ratings are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| But they look to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| There's not a person sitting around this table up here that's not been asked in the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| a hundred times at least or more, why can't you do something about the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| I said, we don't control them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| We don't control them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| And we've been told that on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| But this is a venue for these items to be brought out to where the public, the school system, the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| and anybody, the teachers, whoever wants to have a discussion about this item, I think this is a place to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| So I'm very much in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Of course, when I brought this up, just thinking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| or thinking about whether or not to bring it up as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| the wording of the discussion item was a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| But also, I mean, just the topic because the fact is when the superintendent's contract came before us last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2478)|
| 0:41:30| that's a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| We have no opportunity to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| And that's a topic for commission to address and for our law director to address probably somewhere in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| I hope the consent decree, the so-called consent decree, is reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2504)|
| 0:41:52| I think that, you know, personally, I think it extends too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| It prevents us from doing some things and talking about some things that we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| As to the language, the word revolt, that's a very, very strong word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| And I could have, you know, I could have said something like teacher uprising, which it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| or something very subtle and understated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| But I just thought, well, you know, this is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| And what the teachers have done is historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And it's worthy of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| And we need to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| And we're going to, and, of course, next Monday we'll have some teachers here to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| and to share some of their ideas with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| I don't disagree with anything Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Norman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| We need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| But from the time it was a front-page article in the news center to the time we talk about it, three weeks have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| That's my only issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Again, I don't want to stifle any conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| If I have an issue, I'm going to bring it up and I'm going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| I think everyone knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| That's not where I'm going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I'm just talking about, you know, inflammatory or aggressive language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2590)|
| 0:43:19| when we don't even get a chance to discuss it for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| So that's, again, it's not the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| The topic is timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| And, you know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I think I'll be looking forward to see how far we can dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Because in my mind, I think we can discuss consent items during this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I think we could have brought anything off of educational consent, superintendent's salary, construction schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| how much we're giving for milk programs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| I think we can discuss those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| I think we've said those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| So, you know, I don't view that as limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| But I would be interested in the, you know, on the side topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I would be interested in what the law department has to say about what we can and can't discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| Again, I think we've kind of gone through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| But it would be good to revisit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| But, again, my only concern is you've got this big thing here that we're supposed to talk about three weeks have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| So that's really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| That's my narrow concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| It's not the topic of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Yeah, I really don't want to carry this on too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| And I agree with what Commissioner Brown said and Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| But, you know, I think when we do have people come down here is they need to understand what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| You know, if they want to come down here to inform us or to whatever, I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Because we're asked questions out in the public just like the school board is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| But I think also that when they come down here, if everyone knows ahead of time, both us and the people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| it can avoid misunderstandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| And, you know, we had a gentleman that had a problem with the power of attorney that some of you remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| I think he came down here three or four weeks, you know, wanting us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| And it's fine for him to come down here and vent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| But everyone needs to understand what we can do something about and what we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| That's the only reason, you know, I mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| And at what level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Because we can help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| We can help the teachers or we can help parents or we can help the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| If they want to write letters or they want to make comments to someone, it's, you know, who to address the problems to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2717)|
| 0:45:28| And I think it's important to make that clear, you know, any time we have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Just so there's not we don't meet expectations because we are limited in what our role is with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| But I do agree that it's good to let them vent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| I think it's important for us to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2746)|

| 0:45:49| Discussion regarding telecommunication from NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Just for information purposes, I was asked to serve on the National Telecommunications Committee for NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| We've had probably three to four conference calls over the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| The federal government has allocated millions of dollars for broadband and for IP and that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| having to do with accessing rural areas for broadband but also in times of emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| The state of Tennessee has been allocated $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| And so at the NACO meeting in March, we're going to have two meetings, one with the Federal Communications Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| and the other is going to be just kind of a general discussion about the disbursements of these monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Now, normally when you have a disbursement from the federal government, it's usually based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| So states with more population get more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| But in this case, states like North and South Dakota, Wyoming, get more money than, say, New York or Connecticut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| because it's needed to help with the rural areas for the ranches and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| So the ramifications for us here in Knox County are the ability to apply for funds that will help us through 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2817)|
| 0:47:06| And so we're going to be going to have a meeting with our 9-1-1 people before we go into Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| so that we can better understand how we can apply for that money because the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| And we have to apply through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| And we go through the Department of Homeland Security here in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| So I just wanted to just brief you on that to let you know that these monies are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| We'll see what we can do about getting our share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| And I will report back to you as I get more information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| There's a 9-1-1 board meeting in the morning, and the Homeland Security folks will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| So if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| What time in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| 830 at Barnard Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| One other discussion item added is disposal sale of convenience center on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| At high noon today, the former convenience center on Tazewell Pike, Gibbs Community, was sold at public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2876)|
| 0:48:06| What did you pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| The fellow across the street was a high bidder at $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| The pre-auction estimate was $10,000 to $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| So it brought more than its anticipated sale price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| The reason that I bring it up is it will not be before commission next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| It will be before commission at the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| At our discretion, we have the right to approve or reject the high bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| I would ask that everyone support this high bidder because it gets this piece of property back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| It gets it back to being productive in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| We, commission, have frequently been involved in the sale of surplus property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| or property that has came into possession of the county by delinquent tax process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| And I want to encourage all members of commission to look at such because it enlarges the property tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2947)|
| 0:49:16| when a piece of property that is on the county ownership goes to private ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| If we do not have some five-year plan at least on a piece of property that is surplus to Knox County, it needs to be moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| That was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Sir, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| That's all the items before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| If there's no other discussion, we'll be adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| Order this public hearing in regard to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Clerk, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Yeah, call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Go ahead and call the first discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Discussion of Ordinance O-13-11-101, proposing amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| regarding retail sales of agricultural products in the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| Roy, have you, if you don't care to come up, have you had any constituents call you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| or had any feedback from this ordinance since it went on to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Roy Braden, 400 Main Street, building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| No, not one call, not one question, no complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Any commissioners have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| Is there anybody in the audience that would like to come forward with discussion in regards to the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| Very briefly, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| I am in favor of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| It directly involves one client of ours, the John Deere Nursery on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| It's the old Jim McLean Nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| They have operated out there for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| and then were cited because of a complaint from another neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| who was apparently running perpetual yard sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| And when we looked at it, Mr. McLean initially filed a rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| This has been batted around for several years in discussions with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| There are two neighboring subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| They said, well, he's been there longer than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| We support his continued operation, either Mr. McLean or the John Deere Nursery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| but we would prefer that the property not be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And this is after numerous discussions with MPC staff and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| with Daniel Sanders and others that we have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| I think everybody thinks it's an adequate solution to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Anybody else in the audience want to discuss the Arthur Seymour ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| Let's call it the John Deere Nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| You could probably charge them more if you called it the Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| We will still re-discuss this at the commission meeting, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| because I'm not fully up on what all the verbiage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| Is it in zoning or is it in ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| This will be an amendment to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| It will be moved to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| So it will be discussed in zoning next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| And if any of you have any specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| I'm available to answer those prior to the meeting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| If we have no further discussion, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140121?start=3181)|
