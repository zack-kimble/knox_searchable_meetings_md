| 0:01:43| Is there a motion to approve our minutes of June the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=106)|

| 0:01:52| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Any items dealing with the agenda? Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| Okay. Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Mayor, at the last meeting we talked about postponing the second reading on the HEN ordinance for two more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| But I understand there may be some people who came anyway tonight to speak to HENs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| And so if there are, I don't want to cut off that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| To speak to HENs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| And their council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| And I don't want to cut off that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| And it's early on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| So if we don't postpone, they won't have to wait long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Is it all right to ask, did anyone sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Is there any folks who are here counting on speaking to the urban HEN issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| I don't think we have anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| We don't have anyone signed up on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| If not, then I would like to propose 9B for postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Move to second to postpone 9B for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| I wanted to know what the sponsor thought on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| That's what we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| And that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| I mean, we did, I was going to mention this in council report, but I can go ahead and say now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| We had our first stakeholders meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| It went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| And that stakeholders meeting was meant to identify, make the ordinance stronger and identify all the weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| And it was our great fortune to have many people there who could identify weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| So we're going to have a strong ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| I'm curious why he called that a stakeholder meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| I knew you'd do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| The motion is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Yeah, this is not going to come in the form of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| but the form of a question about what council wants to do on RF4, which is actually at the very end of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=225)|
| 0:03:55| has been a lot of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| there have been a couple of e-mails from the neighborhood groups that have come in asking for a postponement and a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| I wanted to see now at the beginning of the meeting if there was a clear sense of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| on what we wanted to do on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Mayor, I think there are some people here prepared to speak on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| There are three folks signed up to speak on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| I certainly think that we want to hear what they have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| because I think there has been a level of participation and a level of frustration with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| and I think they're entitled to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| I agree with Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| I've heard from a number of people who have worked very hard on this ordinance today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| just even very late in the day, indicating that a postponement with a council workshop would be their preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| and because this is at the very end of the agenda, I'm wondering, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| can I propose to move an item that's on first reading to the front of the agenda so that it can be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| and those folks can speak, and then perhaps after they have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| if it's council's pleasure to postpone, that would happen so they could get on home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| You may move to amend the rules to move it up to the head of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| So seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Okay, the motion is to move to the head of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| which means it would come really right before the items in number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=316)|
| 0:05:26| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Okay, ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| The most to move that item up to before 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Okay, anything else, let's see, dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Okay, consent items are 11U through 11Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Two quick items on Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| First of all, congratulations to Gary Easties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Hopefully everybody got a copy of that business insurance magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Gary was featured in that in their business benefit management honor roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| The city's health care plan was singled out for its cost savings and good management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| as well as being a leader in disease management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| And Larry, Martin, and Gary get a lot of credit for, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| managing kind of a state-of-the-art program that's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| good for the city employees health-wise and also has saved us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| So we're proud of Gary and the feature there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Also, Knoxville Police Department was recognized with a 2010 Tennessee Municipal League Achievement Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| for excellence in police services last week at TML's, or two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| at TML's annual meeting in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| And their quote, I think, was a good one, so I'll borrow it from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| In a relatively short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| the Knoxville Police Department has handled several high-profile cases successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| and commandeered the national spotlight with integrity as representatives of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| and municipal law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| While the force provides excellent day-to-day services for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| it also extends resources to smaller agencies and works diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| to protect Tennessee's children from Internet crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| So to Chief Owen and Chief Boudousis and all the other folks at KPD, thank you for a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Okay, that's it for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Reports from members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Last week I was privileged to spend three days with the Knoxville Fire Department recruit class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| at the training academy on Prosser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| and we learned how to don and doff, those are new words for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| over 70 pounds of gear and experience confined space training for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| I'd like to thank the captains who taught us they were demanding but patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| In particular, I'd like to thank Captain Foster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| who taught me how to put on my gear before I even got to class, my loaned gear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| I'd like to thank our teachers, Captain Dyer, Hurst, Lumpkin, Copus, Will Banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| and the aptly named Captain Payne for allowing me the opportunity to take part in the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| All of the recruits that I worked with were terrific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| and not a single one laughed at my attempts, which was very, very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| In particular, I'd like to thank fire recruit Gilliland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| who welcomed me on the first day and showed me where to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Recruit Stallings, who loaned me his textbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Recruit Skeen, who showed me what page we were on more than a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Recruits McCroskey and Lane, who loaned me gear for PT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| because I did not become properly equipped the first day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| And finally, the men of Company Delta One, recruits McCroskey and Hoover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| who had my back every moment of the way, and without whom I never would have survived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| It was the experience of a lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| and I'm certainly proud of the men and women of the Knoxville Fire Department in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you for the opportunity, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| One, I did, again, Councilman Grieve is not with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| As you all know, he did send us an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| He is watching, so if at any point we want to wave or do anything else to cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| he will get the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| And he actually did just to share, he looked really good when I saw him yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Even though he was in the hospital, he was probably the healthiest-looking person I ever saw in a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| So that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Wanted to do a quick announcement about next Council meeting's dinner, which will be on July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| There are a couple legal issues coming up that I'd like Mr. Swanson to brief us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| And normally legal current or potential litigation is something that we are allowed to discuss in a non-sunshine manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=575)|
| 0:09:46| And so some of our dinner next time, hopefully not more than half of it, will not be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| And I'll work with everybody to make sure we do that in a way that everybody knows when the sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| and the non-sunshine parts are beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| But I wanted to give folks an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| Thank you. Anything else? Okay, we'll move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=604)|

| 0:11:42| Skipping to 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| It's an ordinance to amend certain portions of the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| zoning regulations articles 2, 4, and 5 to add definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| and to create a new R4 residential office district to provide a mix of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| that are complementary in scale to adjacent residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| We do have several folks signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| We actually have three signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| One against and two that are sort of for and sort of against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| So I'm just going to call them, rather than kind of a for and against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| I'll call them in the order that they're signed up in, and I'll call first on Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| And after Lauren will be Jim Bletner and then Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Lauren, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Lauren Ryder, 229 East Scott Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| The R4 revision, there's a current existing R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| The R4 revision as far as Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| I'm speaking on behalf of Old North Knoxville, Inc. as the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| As far as we can see, it is pretty much the same as the existing 01 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| I don't think this is good zoning practice for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| I see very few areas that would benefit from this zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| and I see many neighborhoods will suffer a setback and be harmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| as commercial turns the corner and starts creeping down our residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| What I do see as I drive around Knoxville, all over Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| I see loads of vacant commercial properties in our existing commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| and I don't understand why we would be turning our residential areas into commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| when we have people trying to rent commercial with signs out for years on end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| and they can't rent the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| So I have grave questions about this, and our board of 21 members also question this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=808)|
| 0:13:38| I was just going to say, and quickly, the specific pieces, if this were passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| we're really concerned about front yard parking, the signage, the lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| So I think there are a lot of issues that are new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| I know some people, and I appreciate their efforts, have been working on this in workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| but a lot of us just heard of this last Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| when Nick Della Volpe emailed out some notes about it and noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| So it's news to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay, Jim Bletner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=846)|
| 0:14:15| Jim Bletner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| We started this process about three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| I think it was November of 2007 was the first attempt at trying to do something on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| and generally most of the neighborhoods that I've talked to have been pretty much in favor of the concept of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| We all felt that anything that we can do to help neighborhoods from deteriorating is very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| However, somewhere along the way it's gotten lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| I refer to it as a chameleon because it seems like every time we got our hands around it, it changes colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| So consequently, you have been emailed some changes that we think need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| We do think that there is merit in pursuing the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| However, we do feel that there's still some work that can be done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| We would suggest a workshop because I think you have voted for a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| and most of us would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| And in difference to our neighbors in Old North Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| we did have several from that neighborhood who have been involved in the process over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| However, they have changed administration in their neighborhood organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| And I think that they have a very strong opinion that it doesn't need to go forward at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Consequently, I think we would all benefit from sitting down and talking a little bit more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| And if we were to try to determine it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| we would ask you to vote against it just because they are so opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| But I do think there is an opportunity to salvage this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| and I think it has to be how it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| To me, this is how we viewed it at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| If it's going to be a transition zone, we've already got one in O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| And it's got to be less liberal than O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| It's got to be more conservative than O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| We've already got O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| It's got to be more friendly to the neighborhoods because that's what's at risk is the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| So that was a premise that we have tried to work forward on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| because we felt that that was the overriding importance of what the zone was intended to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| and what we wanted it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| So when we have neighborhoods that feel that we're not there, then we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| So hopefully we can have a good council workshop where we could sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| and we can exchange some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| and then also give us the time to sit down with some of the other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| that may express some interest and see if there is any common ground that we can move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Mr. Dell, about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Mr. Kletner, if I could ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I'd heard reports that the last workshop meeting that was attended by neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| was received by somewhat of a, I don't know, stony reception by MPC not willing to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| or compromises that were pro-neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Can you comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| I mean, are we having an issue with communicating that we're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| I think most of the issues that are still contentious have been issues probably from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| There were a few minor changes that were made, and there have been some changes that have been made along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| So the zone started out as O4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| To us, that's not where the emphasis needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| It needed to be R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| And they made that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| And they've made several changes along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| I think that the vision that we as neighborhoods have is probably a little different than what some of the people at MPC have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| And, you know, reasonable people have disagreements from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| So just having another go at it might help us if we had a council workshop that you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| I think an MPC workshop would be a waste of time for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| because I don't think that MPC feels very comfortable in changing their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| and I don't think we feel very comfortable in changing ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| So that said, I think that would be a waste of time to have a council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Why is it a council workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| A council workshop, I think, could be very productive because I think it is an important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| and I think that the council needs to totally understand it, as do all the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| My name is Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| I'm here representing Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Mayor, members of council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| To follow up on Councilman Della Vopi's remarks a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| I was at the first hour of that meeting last Tuesday with the MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| left very disappointed and very frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Neighborhood groups, and I was part of that process too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| compiled a list of about 25 or more questions, suggestions, concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| about the existing R4 that's trying to be before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| Each and every one of those was rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| There was essentially no communication there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| and we don't claim to be the brightest folks in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| but surely two or three of those major things deserved a little more talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| and a little more open consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| It's very frustrating to try to work with the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| I've been doing this 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I've never seen it like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| As far as R4, the thing to remember about R4, it has some good things in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| It has the potential to be a zone where signs are under more control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| where parking, it has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| But the thing to remember, the underlying thing about the R4 ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| it is an ordinance, to put it very, very bluntly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| that is designed to eat up existing residential housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| and turn it into basically office and commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| even though you call it different things in R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| The greatest asset we have in this town is not out in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| where they're building quarter-million-dollar houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| It's in neighborhoods like mine where there are $100,000 houses and less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| Those are the treasures that will never be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| and that they need to be safeguarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| and we can't have an R4 that speeds the process of eliminating these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| We've got to have an R4 that gives protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| So I would like to see a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Failing that, I don't know that we need to go any further with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| That's all the folks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| We'll see Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| I'm going to make a motion for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Well, let me start by making a motion for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| and then climb on my soapbox for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Well, let me climb on my soapbox first as I think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| This is something I was around at some of the first meetings for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| It seems like it was about 1912 when we started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| It had been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I've been continually frustrated because at about every other month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| there is some zoning that comes through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| that a little section of residence is being turned into an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| There's one coming up on the agenda, the next MPC agenda in my district on Beaumont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| where we're rezoning to office, which allows people to bulldoze the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and build office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| And the advantage of this is that the goal of it is to have offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| that still look like residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| So while there may be creep into residences, it won't be a noticeable creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| And I think it's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| I can understand folks in the neighborhood saying we're against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| because it does indeed make it a little easier that creep will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| I think creep happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| I think we all see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| If you sit here long enough, you see lots of creep happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| I'm also going to very much agree with Jim Blattner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| that any more discussions with MPC are just going to be a waste of air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| MPC and the neighborhoods have been dealing with this for a good three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| and have talked about everything forwards, backwards, over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| and it's time for us to step up and really dig and figure out what to do on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| I think, just from having been gone for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| that the two sides are not that far apart on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| but there are choices to be made on lots of little things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| options that are in it currently and options that neighborhoods are going to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| So I want to suggest that we do a workshop on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and that we do a workshop that we're really focused not on listening to presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| or hearing opinions, but that we sit down and go through this ordinance line by line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| and decide what we want to put in it, which is going to be a little different kind of workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Traditionally, we have not scheduled workshops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Traditionally, we have not even said we are definitely having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| We have a process through Ms. Mitchell where she will poll folks and find a workshop date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| and apparently Mr. Swanson tells me I actually get to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| But I want to make a motion to postpone this for four weeks with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| that we will have a workshop in there and that we will all respond very soon to Ms. Mitchell's e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| and get a date set and dig in and figure out what we want to do on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| The motion is to postpone for four weeks with the proviso in there that there be a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| and Ms. Mitchell, et cetera, would help work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Mr. Dellivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Let me just ask as a clarification, will that give us enough time to, one, have the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| and two, get it back on the agenda, or are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| Well, it will be on the agenda in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| And if we have not had the workshop, we postpone it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| It seems I would hate to postpone longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| There is a chance we can have a workshop next Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| You know, that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| I will also, I know a lot of the, I know all the neighborhood leaders who spoke tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| and I'll let you all know as soon as we get the workshop scheduled when it's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| and what we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1486)|

| 0:26:22| subject to one condition for Buffett Mill Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| property located on the south side of Buffett Mill Road, north side of McIntyre Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| in conjunction with Resolution 11T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| There are several folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Three in favor and three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1601)|

| 0:26:50| In order of those speaking in favor, Ronnie Collins and Christopher Hardy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| and then Gene Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| So, Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| And, Ronnie, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| My name is Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I live at 4606 Washington Park, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| I'm president of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| The subject of tonight's appeal is a large acreage tract, now 75 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| which is one of the few developable tracts in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Because this property is so attractive, we are now facing the fourth proposal since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| You have received a history from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| You know that we have worked closely with two of those developers to achieve what both sides wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| However, now we face a developer who did not consult with us prior to submitting the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| The OMPC approved the plan with one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| meeting all applicable requirements of the Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Does this plan meet the general description for RP1 planned residential districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| Let me read the general description from the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| The regulations established in this section are intended to provide optional methods of land development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| which encourage more imaginative solutions to environmental design problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| And this is a flat of the proposal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| It's 241 units on 75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| Members of council, this is the only piece of the puzzle that exists at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| Where is the imagination in this proposal that meets the guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Our second use on review objection centers on what we will get when this concept is development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| We have 241 single family homes, lots of extremely variable sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| We have been told these will be sold off either individually or in clusters to multiple builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| with no minimum building standards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Nor are there any written provisions for the guidance of the architectural review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| in determining what it will allow to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| We believe this violates section 3 of the zoning regulations general provisions for planned communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| that require development of land in a well-planned and coordinated manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| Where is the coordination when Clayton does not know how they will proceed with building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| More specifically, we believe this violates section 3.1-A for RP1, 2, and 3 zone planned communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1787)|
| 0:29:57| which specifies that residential areas thus established would be characterized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| by a unified building and site development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Where is the unified building plan required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| What we do have as a neighborhood that guarantees what we get will be a development that enhances our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| I'm sorry, what do we have as a neighborhood that guarantees what we get will be a development that enhances our area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| We are told that they are not, that we are to take the word of Clayton Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| that we will not have mobile or modular homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| We look at the one green space that allows public use and we get a basketball court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| How creative, how usable by preschool children and senior adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Obviously, we are wondering how this proposal meets the first requirement for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| which is it must be compatible with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Ronnie, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Mr. Dellabovey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Before you leave, Mr. Collins, wasn't there originally three green space areas presented on that plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| and it turned out that two of them were detention ponds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Did they suggest how one uses a detention pond in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Not at none of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Mr. Hardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| Christopher Hardy, 5331 Blue Star Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I'm representing the Spring Hill Villas Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| The second area of concern with the Clayton proposal revolves around the use of a review requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| that a proposal should not substantially increase the level of traffic into the neighborhood when the project is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| The Wilbur Smith traffic study projects 2,577 daily trips from the Clayton proposal onto Buffett Mill and McIntyre Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1925)|
| 0:32:14| Both of these streets are two-lane narrow streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| The amount of traffic will be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| However, the impact that this amount of traffic will have on Loves Creek and Spring Hill Roads is the unknown factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| When John Gould, engineer for the Wilbur Smith, who conducted the survey, was asked by MPC if the impact on Connector Roads was included in the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| his answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| As you can see from the traffic photos and the maps provided for you, there are already traffic backups in both directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| south towards Rutledge Pike and north towards Millartown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Turning left onto Loves Creek from Buffett Mill or right onto Loves Creek from McIntyre is nearly impossible at several times of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| If you choose to use Spring Hill Road, you encounter one of the worst intersections in Knoxville at Spring Hill and Buffett Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| with its three-way stop and its steep slope that leads to Millartown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Also, please note in the picture that shows the traffic backup at the railroad underpass that the train is stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| When this train is stopped, Spring Hill is blocked at the railroad crossing and the access to Rutledge Pike is also blocked by the traffic or the train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| Finally, the full impact of the traffic on Loves Creek and Spring Hill has not been realized from the build-out of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Spring Hill Villas, which is currently only about two-thirds of the way built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Wilbur Smith projected that about 1,302 daily trips from our subdivision will be incurred when it's fully built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Since we are slightly more, like I said, since we're about two-thirds of the way complete, we've still got to see yet the full impact on the Connector Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| And since Loves Creek is the closest street to our entrance, it's the road that will most likely be impacted the greatest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| By not having a thorough traffic study, the impact on our neighborhoods is conjecture at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Okay, Gene Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| I'm Gene Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| I live at 5226 Brigg Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2040)|
| 0:34:09| I am vice president of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association and president of the Alice Bell Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| I want to continue the traffic issue, but from the environmental impact that additional traffic will have on Loves Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2057)|
| 0:34:27| Although no current traffic study was done on Loves Creek, one was done six years ago when a much smaller development on the same property would only generate 770 daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2067)|
| 0:34:43| The conclusion was that a 75-foot minimum northbound or left turn lane on Loves Creek would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2083)|
| 0:34:56| Since nearly half of the daily trips will be split between Buffett Mill and Loves Creek Road, we project that a left turn lane would also be required onto Buffett Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2096)|
| 0:35:08| You ask, then how does this affect Loves Creek Road environmentally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| The East City Sector Plan has identified this area as fragile because the road closely borders Love Creek and its floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2114)|
| 0:35:26| For this reason, the sector plan states that Loves Creek Road should not be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| Alternatives to heavy north-south traffic on Loves Creek Road are needed, and if possible, non-local traffic on Loves Creek should avoid the tunnel completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2134)|
| 0:35:48| Our position is that not having a complete traffic study violates Section 3's general provisions for planned communities wherein the provisions require a high standard for the protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2148)|
| 0:36:10| Since the environmental effect of traffic from this proposed development was not addressed, the concept is defective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2170)|
| 0:36:20| Since the East City Sector Plan recommends that traffic be diverted from Loves Creek Road and that Loves Creek Road should not be widened, the traffic study for Clayton's proposal is deficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2180)|
| 0:36:36| Now I would like to address one final point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Mayor Haslam has, as the first goal of his administration for Knoxville, stronger and safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2200)|
| 0:36:51| If a neighborhood is not consulted in the planning of a development within its boundaries, how can it be considered strong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2211)|
| 0:37:02| If the neighborhood does not know what it will be getting from a proposed development, how can it consider itself safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2222)|
| 0:37:14| I am proud to be a member of the Mayor's Neighborhood Advisory Council, and Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association is proud of its record in working with developers in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2234)|
| 0:37:31| But neither I nor the Association will stand for being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2251)|
| 0:37:41| We ask you to support a motion to send this back to MPC requiring that both sides sit down and arrive at compromises on the issues and that these compromises be attached to the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2261)|
| 0:37:59| Now, folks, just to show you how much our community supports what we're doing, I want to ask all those in attendance from the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2279)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you, Mr. Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Okay, those speaking against David Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2297)|

| 0:38:27| I'm their engineer and surveyor for this project out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Clayton Bank and Trust has come in ownership of this property through the foreclosure proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| They've looked at this and have determined that the best use of this property now is for a single family detached subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| They are willing to invest in that and to go out there and to create jobs and opportunities for people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| We have met with the homeowners association out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| We've met on two separate occasions and tried to ally their fears that what we're going to put in here, that's not been fruitful to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| In fact, there was even a third meeting that we were invited to and then the invitation was then reneged on that they didn't want us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| So we have tried to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| We've tried to meet with their fears and to work with them on many occasions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| This is a very unique site here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| It's a very large site too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| One of the things it is is at the very top of the subdivision there's some very nice houses, some new condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| and some moderate priced houses and when you get down to the bottom of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| some rental properties and some properties that need fixed up right down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| I think what Clayton Bank and Trust is proposing meets the compatibility of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| It will be an asset to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| In fact, the price point at which they're going in is going to be at or above what's out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| The densities for the areas, the condominiums out there, Buffett Trace has almost six units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| Spring Hill equally about 5.8 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| The properties along McIntyre Road are at 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| This proposal is coming in at 3.23 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| You see that number of 241 lots and everybody gets very upset and worried that it's going to have a huge impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| but really it's just such a large acreage tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| We're not actually anywhere near the density of what a lot of people here today are that they're living in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| I'd like to point out, too, about the amenity package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| One thing that we have added for the entire site are sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| We've put sidewalks in every single road out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| That would be one of the big amenities and it's a very big cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| We've also got one other big area that, you know, we've proposed a basketball court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| We don't know exactly what the residents would like out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| If they want a swimming pool, we'll put them in a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| If they want a clubhouse or a community house, you know, that's something that I think that the people that move in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| and that are invested in the community are the best ones to determine what kind of uses they would have right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| As for the traffic, we have prepared the traffic study as required by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| On that traffic study, we analyzed the intersection points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| We have two locations where we're entering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| One's off Bethel Mill Drive and the other one is off McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Both of those have adequate site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| They have levels of service of at least a B or an A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| And this is a unique site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| You know, I can't deny there are some specific points out there in that area that have traffic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| and issues from time to time during points of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| But the connectivity for this site is great basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| You've got Bethel Mill Drive that can go to Alt Road, that can go to Washington Pike, Millartown Pike, many points of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| On McIntyre Road, you've got areas to Love Creek, Spring Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| So people coming out of the subdivision have a lot of different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| and it don't necessarily will overload one specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| Also note too that the build out of this subdivision is going to be at least a five or possibly even a ten year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2533)|
| 0:42:22| So this thing's not going to happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| It's going to take a long time to reach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| There could be other traffic improvements by the city and other things within that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| So it's not something that's going to be just overnight where they'll have a problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| I've got Mr. John Gould from Wilbur Smith's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| He is here to also speak on more of the traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| But first I'd like to turn this over to Clayton Bank and Trust attorney, Mr. Travis Edmondson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2564)|
| 0:42:53| Travis, if you'd give us your name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Travis Edmondson, 620 Market Street, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I'm here on behalf of Clayton Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I just want to point out several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| One, I think that the Clayton name has caused some issues with the neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| But I want to assure everybody here that we are not associated with Clayton Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| We are a separately owned bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Jim Clayton is our CEO and our owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| But we have no intentions of putting any kind of trailer park on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| We got the site through a foreclosure, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| And we're trying to do the best to not only maximize the return back to the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| but also to maximize the use of the property for potential residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| We try to do everything we think that is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Our intentions are to put site-built homes there ranging from 1,200 square foot to 1,600 square foot for a two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| Our price points will be between 150 and 300 plus is our intentions to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| So just to give some background of how we got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| and I just wanted to assure you that the trailer park should not be considered on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Mr. Becker, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Actually, for either of those, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Actually, if either of the first two speakers, I think Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Mr. Harbin, come on up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I thought of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| You talked at the beginning about the money Clayton was investing in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| and the jobs it was creating building these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Mr. Evans, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Edmondson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Edmondson, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Talked about how they know what they're putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Is Clayton going to be building houses or selling lots on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Because I've heard both stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| So what's the outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| They would like to sell lots, but what we think is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| we're going to have to go in there and build houses to get this thing started at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| The plan is selling lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| I mean, the hope is that these 240 lots, most of them will be built by other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| They understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| They're going to go in and set the price point and start this off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| because I don't believe that somebody would take that risk right now to purchase those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| And when, Mr. Irwin, you met with the neighborhood twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| I met with them personally once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Mr. McClure, who's a board of directors of Clayton Bank and Trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| he has met with them on two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| When you met with them, did you hear their concerns about, I mean, Mr. Edmondson obviously did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| what these houses are going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| You heard those concerns, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| I would also like to point out, too, with the money that they've got invested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and the type of design that we have here, a mobile home park will just not work right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| The lots are not big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| If they really wanted to do a mobile home park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| we would have to come back before you and do another project and get another plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| So what's before us tonight, it has to be a single-family detached subdivision is what it would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| Well, let me just one quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| You're talking about we're not building mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| And I don't know, maybe just being Clayton, that's all you think that the neighbors are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| But the concerns go on to the design of even the other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| So some of what's being talked about that, it's talked about for solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| It's not about mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| But I'm glad you get that sense of a big concern in the neighborhood is what this is going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| what the standards for what's there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| One thing that we're doing now, we also have another property at West Haven Village off Sisk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| We are currently building out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| That price point is about the same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| And we anticipate, you know, building the exact same units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| and models here that's going on out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Mr. Dela Bobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Before you leave, Mr. Harden, you attended the first meeting at Aliceville, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| And that was the emergency meeting after MPC had already received your concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| that you had designed in your engineering shop, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| And they were asking at that time, because I was at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| if you would postpone the MPC meeting and sit down with them and work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| And one of their concerns was they wanted to see some minimum standards since Clayton might be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| might be selling off these lots to other builders, to other sub-developers, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| And they wanted to see some concrete standards that would show the compatibility of the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| and the design styles and those types of things, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| And I think we have that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| You know, one thing you've got to consider is at the top of the hill there are some, I call them mansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| They're really big houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Clayton is the owner of one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| And it's for sale right now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| They're going to do nothing to really hurt the value of that house up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| They want to protect that value, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| So they're invested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| They're a part of the community, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| So, you know, they want the building standards and what's up there to be high as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| But one of the things that that community group asked you was could you attach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| or make a part of the concept plan some building standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| That was one of the rubs that day was can you make it tied to the plan so when it comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| for use on review there will be a standard to measure it against, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| You know, we will have to meet all the standards of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| But that's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| They wanted to see some minimum standards for the subdivision tied to the plan so that when it came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| for use on review there would be something to sort of a checklist to make sure it had those ingredients in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| I've just been informed by Mr. McClure who was more involved in those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| We did send them those restrictions and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| We sent them one that was similar to West Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| The West Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| But you didn't attach them to the plan and offer to make them a part of the restrictions of this subdivision, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| We never received any comment back from the homeowners association if those were acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| if they wanted changed, if something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| So we didn't receive anything back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Let me change the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| The other thing you talked about was and you've got a gentleman here that's going to talk about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| But when you looked at traffic impact, you looked at the entrance and exit at Buffett Mill and at McIntyre, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| That was the focal point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Did we have enough turn radius to get in and out safely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| That was kind of the issue that you were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| That was what we were commissioned, we were asked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Generally what happens is we work with the city engineering department on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and they tell us the areas that they want to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| But what you didn't study was what's the impact on Love's Creek and Alice Bell Road, which are the, or Spring Hill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| which are the major ins and outs for some of these people to get to where they're going, whether it's the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| whether it's to Asheville Highway, to the school down there at Holston Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| That's one of their concerns, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I'll defer to Mr. Gold on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Mr. Gold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| I'm John Gold, Wilberson Associates at 1100 Marion Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| We were asked to prepare a Level 1 traffic study for this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| Level 1 traffic study requires us to look at the site access, and that's what we performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| The other roads in the area, Love's Creek and Spring Hill, are streets that we did not specifically look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| However, looking at the traffic volumes on those roads, they do have carrying capacities for additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Buffett Mill Road has sufficient capacity to handle this particular development, as well as McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| We were involved in past studies on Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| We did identify a left-turn lane there a number of years ago with another development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| It would probably be fairly similar with this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| with the exception that widening of Love's Creek is not something that's currently being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| But as David already indicated, there are alternative access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| With the amount of capacity on Buffett Mill and McIntyre, we do believe Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and other streets to the east will more than manage the traffic of this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Mr. DelBolme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Did you have occasion to go down to Love's Creek at rush hour, especially on the weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| and see how many traffic lights you have to wait to get through that narrow railroad tunnel and get on to Rutledge Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| Not on a weekend, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| Have you done it on a Friday or during the business day at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| We have seen, we do recognize there are issues with the Love's Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| and I know that's been a long-time issue over the 10 years, 11 years that I've been here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| that those issues have existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Again, I believe that with the amount of traffic that we're talking about and with the carrying capacities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| of both Buffett Mill and McIntyre, and with additional north-south facilities that are located to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| peak hours can be also managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| And do you question whether or not you might sit through three, four, or five light cycles just to get through that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| I'm not sure how many cycles you might be delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I do recognize there at Millertown that there are some issues there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| and I believe, as I understand, there might be some plans already to improve that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| But you know about the Love's Creek-Rutledge Pike intersection where there's a narrow tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| I understand that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| You've got to creep through that tunnel to make sure you don't hit the other guy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| That's all the folks we have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Any additional comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I'm new around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Those speaking in favor have a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Anybody that would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Mr. Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| First of all, in response to what David said, you've already heard some information on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| but they said we have met twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| They met twice at our insistence, at our demand almost, to get them to meet the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| And then we offered them the opportunity to meet after that, and we got no response from them until lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| You've received e-mails in regards to all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| David said whatever we put there will be at or above what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| We don't have any idea of what that is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| There is nothing of record that we know of of what's going to be on that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| He said there will be an amenity package, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| MPC required sidewalks be installed in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| And whether or not, and we will put in there what people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| I think it's the best idea for selling something is if you have the amenities installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| and the people see what they are going to get, they will be more likely to buy, and not after they move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| Second, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| They did not address the specifics whatsoever on Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Not even John Gould can say that it's going to be a great way to get to the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| There will be a 10-year build-out, and there could be improvements by the city during those 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| Folks, I've lived there for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I haven't seen any improvements in any of those roads in 15 years, and I don't expect to see them in 10 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| Travis Edmondson, he talked about that they're not associated with Clayton Mobile Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| That never did answer our question of whether or not we would get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| That's why we want minimum building standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| All the specifics that they gave are their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| And then they said that they, well, we've given you a copy of West Haven, the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| I've got a copy of that restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| I read it word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| There is not one minimum building standard in those restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| And the initial architectural review committee is always controlled by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| So what are you going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| And I'll let it be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Now, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| I'm going to go to Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I think that it's a reasonable request for the folks from the community to have an understanding of what's going to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| One hundred and forty-one units is a large development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| And granted, even, you know, you may be able to do more, but that's still a large development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| And I know from the years before when I served on Council that there was not a more organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| or more reasonable or more willing group to sit down with people and listen and try to find compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| And I'm not sure that that's been done in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| So I'm certainly going to support that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| I think that the two sides do go to the table and figure out what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| at least minimum standards are going to be before this development of this size is going to be put in in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Mr. DelBoppi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Yeah, I just wanted to add one item, and maybe Mark Donaldson could address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| But I thought one of the criteria in Section 3.1 that covers RP1 zoning is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3341)|
| 0:55:50| this creative land use thing, and there's a specific subsection, C2, that talks about recreations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| and says that the amount of land set aside for permanent usable open space and recreational use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| shall be 15 percent of the gross development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| In other words, we allow you to increase the density on the track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| and that helps you as a builder get more bang for your buck when you build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| but you're supposed to leave some area that gets developed to enhance that as a neighborhood and living area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| And that part sort of seems to be left out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| It doesn't seem to be blossomed in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Maybe you can tell us a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| But I was wondering about that because that's one of the goals for getting into RP1 as opposed to straight residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| That is one of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| MPC staff and the Planning Commission tried to enforce that for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| and ultimately stopped doing that when City Council and County Commission repeatedly opined that the yards created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3404)|
| 0:56:58| within the individual lots would satisfy the open space requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| We would love to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| I'd say there's a new ballgame here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Vice Mayor Beckham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| I guess I want to actually agree a lot with what Mr. Pavlis said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| And I guess, you know, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Oh, Mr. Harbin is standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| I was actually going to say you had to stand here the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| I was going to make Mr. Edmondson come up and listen to me, if you'd rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| because you can imagine I have pleasant things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Come on up, Mr. Edmondson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Mr. Harbin knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I think Mr. McClure does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| You're new, so we'll do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| I think one of the things Mr. Pavlis said that's real true is that this is actually a remarkably reasonable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| They care a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| They care a lot about their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| And in this case, I think there's some frustration up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| because I don't think you at Clayton Homes and the neighborhood are that far apart on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| I think the neighborhood you want to build actually is what they want to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| and they just want to get some proof that you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And I think that in a way it's really sad, because I think, and I had a conversation with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| our only option right now is to send this back to MPC, which is just going to delay you, cause you all more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| I think that you can get worked out what needs to be done on some design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| Again, I think what you want to build is what the neighborhood wants to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| and they just want to see the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| And I guess the one thing of standing up there is knowing in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| it is a whole lot better to do those conversations on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| because by the time you come here, we don't have any option but to cost you more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| And I know right now time's a factor for you all, and I wish there was a better way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| But I think there's going to be a motion coming, I think from the district rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| about sending this back to city council to do things right, or sending this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3529)|
| 0:58:58| What with a prompt like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| I'll make the motion that we do send it back to MPC, but honestly, you guys have a conference room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| you're legal counsel, you have gotten people together before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| If you don't need to wait to have a formal meeting at MPC, go sit down with the folks, see what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| If it's standards, lay them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Mr. McClure is a pretty bright developer, has developed land his whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| He can help you craft stuff that will work and will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| And I think it's the take the proactive approach and find a way to work it out and just get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| They did approve the last development at this site, and unfortunately the gentleman had financial difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| and he didn't build it, but I think there is an opportunity to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Just take it and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| So I'll make the motion that we send it back to MPC with the recommendation that you meet in advance, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Okay, moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Ms. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| We need a little more development of that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| If you're going to send something back to MPC, you have to give MPC some type of direction as to what you wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| for them to do when it's referred back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| Well, let me revise my statement then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| I move that we send this matter back to MPC with a stipulation that both Clayton Bank and Trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| and the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association meet within the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| and try to achieve a compromise on at least the following two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| One is some minimum building standards, and I'll give you this piece of paper if you want it to help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| but essentially, you know, specify some lot size, square footages, living space square footages, roof pitch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3637)|
| 1:00:45| some of the design features that make these structures compatible with the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| That's one of the objectives that you're shooting for as you go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And secondly, that you adopt some of these, whether they're recreational or green standards in designing the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| so that they meet that philosophical objective of RP1, which is increase the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| but add the amenities that make it livable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| And then they become a productive part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| So with those two things, the minimum standards and the use of the land space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| Ms. Palmer, is your second still good for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| This isn't the first time we've, one of the first, I guess, property discussions that I had when I came on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| was this very property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And I know Councilman Pelos is in the audience, and I looked at what's legally required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| and the conditions that various pieces of property are subject to before they can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3704)|
| 1:01:52| But then I started, as I went out and met with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| I realized that people have concerns unless they're shown some sort of design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3715)|
| 1:02:04| and really what the amenities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| And I think that, like Vice Mayor Becker said earlier, I don't think they're very far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| I just think there's a lot of concerns and a meeting or two would go a long, long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| You know, you said the price points $150,000, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| so I'm always concerned about property values and the character of the neighborhood and is it compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| And it sounds like it's going to be, but there's just a lot of unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| And this is the first time I think we've sent something back to the MPC to be worked out in the way of a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3752)|
| 1:02:41| It's been my experience that we just ask the two bodies, if possible, to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| and to go through what the concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| And I don't know, Gene, if that's something you think would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| I don't know how long it would take before the MPC could go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| I don't know what the timing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| But I just, in the past, we've encouraged neighborhoods and developers to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| and discuss these issues, some of which are subject to, you know, our responsibilities as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3785)|
| 1:03:15| Unfortunately, we're not, we react to some of these situations and haven't been proactive in some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3795)|
| 1:03:24| So we just, we've got our end of the deal after, you know, if something moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| So I was just, Gene, do you think that it's necessary to go back to the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| I would be willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| I know my colleagues in the past, we don't go and we're not as involved because of the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3818)|
| 1:03:47| but we go and we observe and we listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Do you think that's something that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| We have always been ready to meet and to discuss this and achieve the compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| The only limitation on us is obviously we're an association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| We've got to have special call meetings to appoint a committee to meet with Clayton Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| But as soon as we can get that done, we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Do you think that's a better way to go than go back to the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| I mean, is that a little more hands-on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Well, the only thing we need to know is that what we do come up with gets attached to the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| And that's MPC's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Let me ask Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| I'm sorry, I do have a lawyer thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| What we're talking about is sending this back and dealing with the use on review and not the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| Concept plan does not come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Concept plan, to my knowledge, has not been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| But if it does get appealed, it gets appealed to the circuit of the Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| What's appealed here is the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| And so substantially what you're saying is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| but what you want to do is for these folks to have a meeting and come to a meeting of the minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| and then have a use on review that has these specific standards in it that you've referred to rather than the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3901)|
| 1:05:11| because the concept plan is already approved and finalized if it's not been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| It's always been my feeling that when we ask you to go do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| and both parties agree to do it, then it's more hands-on and we know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| It comes back to us and we work together on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| Because I really think it's just a lot of sharing of information and communication and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| Also, it would be nice if we could have one representative from the city council there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| I'd be happy to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Let me ask Mr. Harbert or Mr. Edmondson, would they be willing to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| or would they prefer the MPC route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| Clayton makes fine with that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| He'd be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| I would prefer to do that, so I don't think I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| If you come up with a plan that is different, with a use on review that's different than the use on review that was submitted to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3962)|
| 1:06:11| we're going to have to send it back to MPC for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| And so that would really shorten the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| And I think everybody, if a compromise can be reached, everybody wants to accomplish this as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3977)|
| 1:06:25| And this is the method by which, as soon as possible, it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| Because what would happen is they go out and reach a compromise, come to us, report their compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| and then they would want to have a use on review that has these specific provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Those specific provisions, having not been reviewed by MPC, you'd have to then send them back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| And this way you just kind of shorten that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| And I know this is complicated and it's not the way we do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| There are some things that we can do the way that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| But if we have a different use on review, a substantially different use on review than what was approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| and we can't show that MPC considered those items, then we'd have to send it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| or you would have to send it back to MPC anyway for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| And this kind of just provides a shortcut to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| So I don't know if that's helpful or harmful in terms of your analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| I appreciate that and respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| And maybe I will support the sending it back to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Councilman DeVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Yeah, I just wanted to tell Clayton Bank, I hope you don't think we're picking on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| We realize that you were a lender in this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| and you were kind of caught in the middle of a financial difficulty with the original builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| And it's not your business to be a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| You've taken on that role in trying to get this thing started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Hopefully that will help you recover your investment in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| But, again, try to work with the neighborhood because I think you end up with a better product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| They'll end up being your salesman instead of your enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| They want to see their neighborhood grow and be healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| and have good homes and good development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Okay, there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4093)|

| 1:08:43| and East Tennessee Conference scheduled to be held at the Knoxville Convention Center on September 29, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| And I see Mr. Holquist is here, and I think he'd like to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| and then I have an amendment to make to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| And Councilman Grieve has called me, so I'm going to take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Go ahead, and Councilman Holquist, if you'd like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Sorry, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Joe Holquist, 2240 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Good to see you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Good to be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| I don't have to come every other Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| But the resolution before you is essentially almost identical except for the change in dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| and the change in conferences to the one that was passed by this council in early 2007, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4161)|
| 1:09:31| or late 2006, early 2007, in preparation for the first Plain Talk on Quality Growth Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| Many of you attended at least some of that or are aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| That conference was at the end of March of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| We'd originally hoped to have one in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| That's shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| This, as Vice Mayor Becker said, there's going to be an amendment, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| We decided rather than holding it at the end of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| it made more sense to move it to the end of March again, and I can explain that if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| but it has to do with another project that East Tennessee Quality Growth has taken on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| the development of a 16-county regional quality growth toolbox, mostly for local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| cities and county governments in the 16-county region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| and we wanted to coordinate as much as possible the conference with the toolbox development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| and this works better schedule-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| There's some other reasons, too, but it just really makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| So basically the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| I actually want to say something about this, but first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Councilman Greve wanted to just call and say thank you for what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| but mostly he wants to know why Councilman Woodhull is sitting in his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| He said, I'm gone for two meetings and you take my seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Hey, you don't come, you don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| I mean, what the hell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| I wanted to just share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| No mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| No mercy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| No mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| And now his seat's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| We won't be answering the phone for him anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| He's got his one phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| I wanted to go ahead and amend this to change the date from September 29th, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| to March 29th through 31st, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Is that the only amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| I think that's the only amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| I know some lights are ‑‑ I'll come back to you if you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| This is on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Only on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| On the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| On the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| I want to vote on that and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| All those in favor of the motion to amend to make the new dates 329 through 31st of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Councilman Becker, as the maker of this motion, I wanted to clarify with you some language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| On the back page, the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th, whereas the council, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| desires to endorse and support this very important regional event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| I agree it's an important regional event, but in tight budget times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| I would like to sort of clarify what you mean by endorse and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| I think it means that we think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| I mean, I know I've committed some of my 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| I know that Councilman Holquist has a request that other people put in 202s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| but this is not a budget amendment at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| So no specific dollar amounts being pledged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| We have a goal, but, no, there's no pledging in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Mr. Holquist, if I could ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Pardon my ignorance, but could you give us like just a minute's worth of the kinds of things that we accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| at such a conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I did not make your last one, so I'm not sure I know what you do, and I want to find out if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| Well, Councilman Della Voppe, at the last conference, we did not have an organization at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| It came out of a couple of task forces' efforts that grew out of the Nine Counties, One Vision process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| that were related to encouraging high-quality growth in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| anticipating growth in the region, and trying to marshal forces and provide resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| to make sure that that growth happened in the most positive sense possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| addressing transportation, land use, environmental impacts, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| My throat's a little messed up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| So we structured the conference that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| It was a major conference at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| We had keynote speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Congressman Duncan was the honorary chairman, and he's agreed to do that again, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| I should have mentioned that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| And he, in turn, brought in major speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| He brought in the U.S. Secretary of Transportation for the first conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| We were hoping for around 400 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| We had nearly 700 attendees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| It's kind of learning and spitballing kind of planning, thinking big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Thinking big picture, providing local governments, elected officials such as yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| city councils, county commissions, local planning commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Every local government has a planning commission, even if they don't have zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| because they have to approve subdivision plans and plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| And we got quite a few of those folks, and this time we're pushing to get a lot more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| We're hoping to exceed 1,000 attendees this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| That's our goal, based on the nearly 700 last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Okay. Additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| for the design and construction of the City View Riverwalk Extension with a cost to the city not to exceed $101,380.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4478)|
| 1:14:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Mr. Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I just wanted to get a little understanding for, I guess, for the rest of us folks out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| We're spending $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| We were originally going to do something closer to the hospital that is no more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| and so we're trying to redirect our efforts closer to City View and that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Is that kind of a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| That's basically right, and Brent, if you want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| But if you want to get right back to it, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| We originally were thinking the hospital would be the central point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Now with City View probably being the first big project that's going to be located in that new stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| we thought we'd go ahead and start the riverwalk in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| So we're going to start advancing the walkways and the development that goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Brent, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| We're going to extend from the existing riverwalk that we've got built there at City View back to Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| There's a piece of property that was left vacant for such purposes early in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| and now that's the plan is just to extend the riverwalk to Blount Avenue so there will be access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4551)|

| 1:16:59| Mr. Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Yeah, I wonder if Mr. Walsh or someone is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| He is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Joe is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| I just wanted someone to explain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| I was reading this and we had a public bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| We apparently didn't take the low bidder, took Design and Construction, the second place bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| I just didn't know what had happened in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| There was a difference in price of about $60,000, and it looks like we've negotiated it down to more like $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| But would you explain the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| How did we get here in terms of costing this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| We were working with the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Anytime you get a bid that's significantly lower than other bids, we're a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| So we reviewed their numbers and sat down with the low bid contractor and discussed where they got their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| And after our conversation, they didn't feel quite as comfortable with their numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| and decided to pull back their bid with our permission because we felt like that was a no-win effort on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4668)|
| 1:17:58| So they had missed something that was important to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| And, therefore, we then negotiated with the second low bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Their second bid was still above our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| so we had to identify several items that we were able to reduce in order to get it down to within our budget of $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| So I take it you're comfortable this is a good value for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Exactly, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| And we've worked a lot with design and construction services who are going to be the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| and we're very comfortable with where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4709)|

| 1:18:49| Joe, since you're so close to the microphone, if I could ask you a question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| Do I understand what we have is KCDC is obviously managing the housing in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| and since your group is a recreation specialist, you come in and manage that piece of it for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Five properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| And we've been doing this for 20 or 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| We provide the staffing and some of the materials to provide recreational opportunities for the people that live at Isabella Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| and Love Tower, Northgate, and Cagle Tower, as well as Guy Belove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| Plus, money also goes toward our Center City Youth Sports Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| which offers opportunities for children who live in public housing to participate in basketball, football, baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| So you bring healthy recreation to some of these type project areas and housing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| And we have a really good relationship with KCDC in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4782)|

| 1:20:23| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Yeah, I guess is Madeline here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Can I ask her a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Madeline, it looks like we've got 150 homes we're going to try to help folks get the heating and air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| and some of those things up to speed and get them so they're more livable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| and maybe even less expensive to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Do we use private contractors to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| How do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| This is CAC who implements this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| You get the grant, give them the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| And then they have staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| They may sub some of this out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I'm not sure if anybody from CAC is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| But it is their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| We provide funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| They also have a variety of other funds like the weatherization funds that they get routinely plus stimulus dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| They're able to combine different pots of money and really optimize the improvements on homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| And they have a crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| But as I mentioned, they may also sub some of this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| But part of what we're doing is making these houses more livable and maybe less expensive to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Well, a lot of these are emergency repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| So somebody needs heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Somebody needs air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| A roof is leaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| This is triage almost as opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Yeah, this isn't about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| These aren't full rehabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| These aren't extreme makeovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| These are taking care of really basic problems that impact the livability for these individuals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Madeline, I noticed that these funds are all earmarked in 11I and 11J for District 6, or at least that's how it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4913)|
| 1:22:04| Council districts affect it all, but it's physically located in 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| So every district can get into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Yes, I think this means that CAC is physically, the office of CAC is physically located in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| Thanks for asking that question because I don't want anybody to misunderstand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| The work is citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| The work is citywide for low to moderate income residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| Due to the nature of the funds, it's restricted to certain income levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| I'm curious about if someone needs the emergency funding, how long does it typically take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| I'm sure it's case-by-case basis, but how long does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| Well, it can take up to a year at times because there is a long waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| There are a lot of people that are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| And so CAC takes applications and they work as feverishly as they can to get this work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4970)|
| 1:22:58| But there are people that because they get so many applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| there are people that are on a waiting list sometimes for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Well, if those people are waiting a year, they're kind of falling through the cracks, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| Is there some other agency or something that can help them in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| Because if you're in a need like that, you need it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| I think because CAC provides a number of social services, you know, CAC is a huge organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| They have a lot of different kinds of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| So they try to work with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| There are a number of church groups that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Compassion Coalition, if you're on their newsletter, they often will announce needs of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| But the truth is there are not enough dollars for a lot of the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| And there is need that is not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| And that's why we keep trying to increase the amount that we're able to put into this each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| But in the last few years, our CDBG funds have basically been flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| And so we're not able to put a lot more in each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| But there definitely are people with great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| As you and I recently, Councilman Brown, we have both been in touch with a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| a church group that is helping a woman in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| And they are trying to find resources because this woman would have to wait a year to get the emergency roof repair that she needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5060)|
| 1:24:31| And so in this case, I worked with them, as you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| and helped identify another source of funding that we think will, we hope will be provided to fix this woman's roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| So there are a lot of different folks in town, a lot of different organizations that try to address these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| But clearly, we need the churches to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| We need the private sector to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| Because we cannot, CAC and the city cannot meet all of the need that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Any additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Okay, we're to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5106)|

| 1:25:10| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Neighborhood Housing Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| to provide $70,000 in community development block grant funding for the minor home repair program operation backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5114)|
| 1:25:23| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Mr. DelBofe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I just want to ask one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| We just have a different group that's administering this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Is there some significance to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Well, this is a different model for a group, and it actually kind of builds upon what we were just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| Knoxville Leadership Foundation, this sub-organization, I guess you would say, of Neighborhood Housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5142)|
| 1:25:51| they actually leverage volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| So Chris Martin, I believe, is still here, and he can answer some, if you have specific questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| But they actually use groups that come in, a lot of youth groups, I believe, and others that will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| And so these dollars are actually going a lot further than you would think because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| Facilitating something they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| They're bringing the labor to it, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| They have volunteers that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| Of course, they have a program manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| They staff it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| They can buy some materials, but they get a lot donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| Chris, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| I don't know if you would like to hear from him because they've been doing this for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| and it's a very good operation, leverages quite a bit to address, you know, the needs that we were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5187)|
| 1:26:38| That sounds like a good way to get people involved in both construction and constructive community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| It sounds like a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Chris, you got a minute for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Come down and brag about yourself because it is a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| You should talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Chris, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Chris Martin, 1433 Exeter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| I'm the president of Knox Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Neighborhood Housing is a supporting corporation of our corporate entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| and we've been running Operation Backyard for 12 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| We work on about 50 to 70 houses a year using volunteers we manage and recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| mainly church volunteers, youth groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| We got Church Street United Methodist Church doing about five or six houses, roofing houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| We leverage these dollars with the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| It also provides our Affordable Housing Trust Fund, provides funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| We get private donations and put it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| We roof houses and paint houses with some of the funding we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| private funding we use to paint houses with, gutters, a lot of wheelchair ramps for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| It's a siding, a lot of things like that that volunteers can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| It's not what CAC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| It's more complicated a lot of the time with heating and air and plumbing and electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| Our folks are not, you know, we usually don't go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| You're more of the hands-on guys that get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| So we coordinate it all, put it all together and recruit churches that will be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| We'll have anywhere from 30 to 50 churches a year that will be involved in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| So it's a cool thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| The kids, the students that work, it's just a powerful thing to see what students learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| from giving back to their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| But then also you're looking at a lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| It's mainly seniors that we work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| These are folks who own their homes, who've worked hard all their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| and own their homes and their roof's leaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| They can't afford $3,000 to put a roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| And they're forced to look at moving out of their house versus a volunteer group showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| and spending a week there roofing their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| So it's a pretty powerful thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| We're grateful for your help and support and partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5331)|

| 1:28:55| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Design and Construction Services, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| for the volunteer landing gateway village project for an amount not to exceed $225,014.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Mr. Johnson, I have a question about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| I wondered at first if this were a typo, that it says the original funding was in the 2000-2001 capital improvement budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| What dark hole did this fall into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| The original funds, and Ann's here to help if I get lost in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| but originally it was called the pedestrian linkages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| and we primarily wanted to create some ADA-type accessibility for places that didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5373)|
| 1:29:42| In addition to that, it was pedestrian linkages, so it just wasn't disabled folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| It was everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| So originally we funded the original wayfinding out of it years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| We proposed a sidewalk or an accessible passage from the city county building up on Main Avenue all the way down to the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5394)|
| 1:30:05| That came in way over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| This was, I don't know anything else to call it other than a pork barrel project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| It's 100% federally funded, so it stayed on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| The funding remained there, and now we've been able to convince the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| to let us use that for this gateway village so that folks will have some parking areas near the gateway there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| and head on down toward the waterfront via the parking lot and the elevator over there across from the white fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5427)|
| 1:30:36| So the money still provides linkages for folks with disabilities, but in a different manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| In a different manner, plus we're adding 17 parking spaces in that small area that looks somewhat abandoned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| And I assume a portion of them will be marked for handicapped accessibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| So that those folks we're targeting can get on the elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Well, it's certainly challenging terrain between here and there, so I can understand a bit why this took a while to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| Okay. Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5466)|

| 1:31:14| for the lease of 20 motorcycles for use of the Knoxville Police Department in an amount not to exceed $48,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Yeah, I don't know who can speak to this, but I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Why do we lease these as opposed to buy the units and use them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Is it more efficient? Is it cheaper? I mean, what did we find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Yeah, I think the answer is yes, it's cheaper to lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| But, Gus, you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| In the same way that we've used and leased some vehicles privately to get new motorcycles every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| if they're returning in a good shape, if you add benefits to the department tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| they can just keep them for a short while and return right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| The city did the math on it. It's cheaper to lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| We get great return value after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Would it be prompt to amend this by nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| You're not the first council person that's asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| No, but it would be improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Councilman Hall used to ask that every time it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Hornsby Brand Design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| to provide services required for the production of a 60-second television commercial for Knoxville area transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| in a total amount not to exceed $77,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| Yes, I guess this is probably for Ms. McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| Was this project bid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| Was it bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| No, the project was not bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Last year, it might have been two years ago by now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| we put out a request for proposals for professional design services to assist us with our brand creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| and Hornsby Brand Design was selected for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| and we are really striving for a continuity of presence, if you will, with the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| and Hornsby Brand Design is the firm who designed the dotted logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| and for consistency's sake, one of our goals was that we would have this continuous brand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| if you will, guiding us through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| So this project was not bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| This is a continuation of the services from Hornsby Brand Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| Is this typical to not bid projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| No, I would not say it's typical to not bid projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| There was a competitive process used to select Hornsby, though, several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| There was a request for qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| and I think that was what finance felt more comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| realizing it was a selection based on qualifications and not proposed fees, whereby Hornsby was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5631)|
| 1:34:01| Okay, and the $77,000 is coming from the congestion mitigation and air quality funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| How much money will be left in that fund to see us through the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| if $77,000 comes out to make this 60-second commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| We have various CMAQ grants right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and this is one of the older grants that went back with the Smart Fix 40 promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| and actually we need to get this grant closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| and it has funding in it for public outreach to encourage support and use of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| So this project is consistent with the original grant intent over the several years that Smart Fix 40 has been taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5676)|
| 1:34:44| So this grant also is providing for the repainting of the buses that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| and hopefully that grant will be finished this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| This does not preclude us from pursuing other CMAQ grant opportunities in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| whether there is additional CMAQ funding available for other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| So we won't have a problem with funding, though, on the congestion days and the free ridership because of any of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5701)|
| 1:35:08| No, that's funded from a separate grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| However, staff is sort of of the opinion that that's outlived its useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| We're finding that we are not encouraging new riders to ride the buses during those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| More of our current passengers are riding more frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| and, frankly, we have been really taxed the past few weeks with air conditioning problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| And when you keep the door of the bus open constantly all day long to pick up and drop off passengers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| it's almost impossible to keep the bus cool as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| So the air quality action days is sort of coming around to not being the positive thing that we originally hoped that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5737)|
| 1:35:47| Thank you for allowing me to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Mr. McGinnis, if you could help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| I'm confused a little bit because we have a system that we subsidize in order to get good bus service to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5754)|
| 1:36:06| Why do we need to spend $77,000 to brand our buses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| They're not going to go to a competitor and take his bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| I mean, what do we get for the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| What's the value added, I guess, for spending the money is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| If we open a $30 million transfer center and we do our jobs right and we promote ourselves right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| ridership better increase over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| And that's how we can gauge if it's been effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| But marketing is proven to attract attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| And, frankly, when I first came to CAP four years ago, we had old buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| The transfer site out front isn't that comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| It was sliding in its marketability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| And now we've got a great fresh product and it's time to market it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| So we're going to fill buses and put dollars in the fare box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| That's the hope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Well, filling, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| I wanted to figure out where we're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| I mean, it's not like we're fighting, you know, someone else's brand for buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| But you think you get more awareness out of it by having a TV commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| More positive awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| When fuel was up near $4 a gallon, our ridership went through the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| And when fuel prices went back down, people got comfortable going back to their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| And we need a constant reminder out there to the public that, hey, this transit system is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| It's state of the art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| It needs you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| Additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| I heard seven ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| Next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| We have a motion authorizing the mayor to execute a second amendment to the agreement with ProCare Pharmacy Benefit Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| Inc., to extend the provision of pharmacy management services for the city's self-insured workers' compensation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| through October 31, 2010, at an estimated cost of $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Mr. Delvalle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| If Mr. Martin is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Yes, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| And I could ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Obviously, workers' comp is an important thing and providing prescriptions is an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| $135,000 for four months kind of took my breath away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Is that the scope of the problem we're dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| Well, Council Member Della Vopi, it is our estimate of what those claims would be in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| Remember, this is the pharmacy benefit management of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| And so depending on the nature of the claims that you have, there may be a good bit of medicine that's used in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5913)|
| 1:38:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| I need some of that medicine now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| That's used in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| So it's a function of the amount of claims we have and the nature of those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| And so that's our estimate at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| And it's a far more economical way to do this than just through the retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| I guess, you know, the interesting part is that this is sort of the group benefit special program just for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| So, I mean, I think what Mr. Martin said is in a way it takes your breath away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| And it's scarier because if everybody went to Kroger's to buy their medicine instead of using this program, it would be a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5954)|
| 1:39:22| So, yeah, our workers' comp costs are pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| You picked up big time on that during the budget at how high those numbers were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| And this is another one of those contracts where it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| And I know we're doing some steps in some of our safety management to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| But the way to deal with this kind of cost is doing the right things now with our workers, the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| the push on safety so that folks don't get hurt in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=5995)|

| 1:40:12| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6012)|

| 1:40:42| 11-Q is a resolution authorizing the mayor to accept a proposal from Liberty Mutual Group, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6042)|

| 1:40:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Mr. Del Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Ms. McGinnis is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Yeah, we've got several cat things on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| But I guess I'm wondering what is the main workers' comp experience you're having in the bus business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6067)|
| 1:41:16| I mean, is it in the maintenance group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Where does this come from in terms of the expenses that you're incurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| It's across the board between the maintenance and operations departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| Operations departments, of course, is bus operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| There are times when a bus operator will fall in the lot getting on their bus or they will fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6091)|
| 1:41:39| Falls, frankly, are kind of a big piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| And, you know, we're an aging workforce, and there are a lot of back injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| You know, driving a bus can be a pretty sedentary job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| and sometimes if an operator is involved in an accident, it strains their back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| And some of our operators, I shouldn't say this, aren't in the best physical shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| but it's just back injuries and slip and falls mainly on the operations side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| And then in the maintenance department, of course, they're dealing with a lot of machinery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| So that can be quite varied back there, broken fingers, foreign bodies in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6130)|
| 1:42:18| In terms of the first part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| is there any program to kind of help improve the health or durability of our workers so that we don't incur some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| Well, yes, and we're right across the street from the Y,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| and we encourage the employees to use the Y, which they do, and they're walking a lot more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| and they're encouraged to participate in some of the city programs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| We've seen a much lowering of claims in experience over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| but it's still, you've got to take care of your workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6163)|

| 1:43:22| He's the, I believe he's the executive director of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| To me, this is an exciting program because it's essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| and you tell me, Chris, if this is a good way of putting it, it's a social purpose enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| I mean, this, you are developing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| At the same time, you are incurring profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| So on some level, you're sustaining a social purpose program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6226)|

| 1:43:49| Hey, Chris, if you could just give us your name and title, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| My name's Chris Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| I'm president of Youth Transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| You need my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| And Youth Transitions, we're a simple corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| We're a non-profit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| We're dedicated to training high school students and young adults with special needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| and we train them specifically to work in the food service industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| So going into this enterprise just fits our mission, and it's just a neat fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| We will staff about four or five people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| We'll have a manager, an assistant manager, and three students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Those students, we have trained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| We have trained them using the ProStart curriculum by the National Restaurant Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| and they will produce all the food for that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| We also run a different cafe at the Midday Cafe, which is at the Cokesberry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| and our students are actually trained in the Cokesberry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| and we work with Cokesberry United Methodist Church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| So that's the short of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| You do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| I mean, not only do you have a lot of experience working with young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| but you even managed a lunchbox, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Yeah, for about 13 years, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Oh, actually, we already did vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| We could vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| 11-S is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a use agreement with NAMA LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| to install and maintain a patio area, an overhead awning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| and a blade sign within and or projecting over the city-owned pedestrian way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| located adjacent to the building at 506 South Gay Street, which is occupied by NAMA LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| I think Hannah Parker has already answered my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| but I see Mr. Lyons down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| My understanding is that we will not obstruct the passageway to the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| or any of the pedestrian way that's going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| even if they do have sort of a little cafe on the sidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Yes, Councilman Dolovopoulos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| We've went out and examined the space closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| Of course, engineering has participated in this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| and there's ample room for pedestrians to get by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| We're getting a little more street fair kind of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| where people can have a meal outside on good weather or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| I mean, it will be both on Gay Street and around the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| and it will liven up that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| and I think it will make it much more attractive to people to have folks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| I think that takes us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| Do I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| Mr. Jim Ulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| He's with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6383)|
| 1:46:50| Jim Ulrich, 551 English Village Way, apartment 917, zip code 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6410)|
| 1:47:00| While they're passing that handout down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| I would like to thank you for the support that you've given for the quality growth conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6423)|
| 1:47:13| Those of you that have never been to it before, I would highly recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| It was amazing, the last one we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| the number of people and how much consensus there is in this area for quality growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6446)|
| 1:47:34| And I'm glad they've moved the date because I'll be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| I'm going to be in town in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| What I wanted to talk a little bit about tonight was public participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| and the handout that I passed around I think is the best format I've ever seen for what public participation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6468)|
| 1:48:06| and how to organize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| And it's called a spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| It goes from the informed to the empowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| And my experience is that the public that is involved is usually starts, they think they're empowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6499)|
| 1:48:30| The person that's holding the thing, a city office or a planning department, is usually on the other extreme informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6510)|
| 1:48:44| And the goal is never really clear in anybody's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6524)|
| 1:48:54| And that's one of the reasons I like this thing because when we do have public participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| I think for it to really be effective, the goal has to be understood by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| When you get down to the end, like I say, people think you empowered them, but you're doing it for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6549)|
| 1:49:19| And the items below it goes into a little bit about what you're saying to the public when you're doing any of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6559)|
| 1:49:31| if it's an empowerment or consulting or involving, and then some of the techniques that are used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6571)|
| 1:49:41| And we use public hearings, I would say, most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6581)|
| 1:49:50| But there are a lot of other ways we can have public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| And a lot of times public hearings, a lot of people aren't hearing and most people are just talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6595)|
| 1:50:06| So I thought particularly the new members on city council, if you haven't been involved much in public participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6606)|
| 1:50:18| this might help you a little bit about how to get it organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| If you go to the website for this organization, they also have training in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6623)|
| 1:50:32| which I think is something that we should work on in this city with organizations of trying to get people trained in this method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6632)|
| 1:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Before Jim leaves, can he give us the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| Look on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6652)|

| 1:50:55| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Go to IAP2.org, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| If you Google on the left-hand corner, it's International Association for Public Participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| You'll get there with Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| But I think it's IAP2.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Having no further business come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100629?start=6680)|
