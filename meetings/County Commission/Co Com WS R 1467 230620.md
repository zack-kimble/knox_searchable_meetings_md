|     451 |   453 | So, Mr. Kevin, thank you.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=451.0)  |
|     453 |   454 | All right.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=453.0)  |
|     454 |   455 | Well, thank you so much,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=454.0)  |
|     455 |   457 | and thank you for your service on the Fire and Rescue Committee.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=455.0)  |
|     457 |   459 | I know it's been time consuming.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=457.0)  |
|     459 |   462 | That's been a very positive thing that the county has instituted                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=459.0)  |
|     462 |   463 | over the last couple years,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=462.0)  |
|     463 |   468 | and everybody's there able to talk through the challenges that they have together.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=463.0)  |
|     468 |   473 | And from my perspective, I can see that there's positive steps in the right direction.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=468.0)  |
|     473 |   477 | I do want to thank Director Seymour here.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=473.0)  |
|     477 |   479 | He came along in the middle of this process,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=477.0)  |
|     479 |   483 | and that's been another very positive addition that the county has stepped forward                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=479.0)  |
|     483 |   486 | to help with the coordination                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=483.0)  |
|     486 |   491 | and also to help with that subject matter expertise in-house                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=486.0)  |
|     491 |   494 | that will help you to make good decisions                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=491.0)  |
|     494 |   500 | as you're managing the growth and the challenges that do come with population changes.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=494.0)  |
|     500 |   508 | So back in April, I did a presentation to the Fire and Rescue Committee.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=500.0)  |
|     508 |   512 | This is a condensed version of that, so it's not going to be the entire length of that.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=508.0)  |
|     512 |   516 | I think each of you have the packet or the copy of that in your packet,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=512.0)  |
|     516 |   519 | so there may be some stuff in here that sparks your interest,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=516.0)  |
|     519 |   524 | and you can go in and look at that and get a little bit more down in the weeds.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=519.0)  |
|     524 |   528 | So the scope of the project, as requested by the committee,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=524.0)  |
|     528 |   534 | was basically sort of a refresh of the previous presentation that was done back in 2019.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=528.0)  |
|     534 |   539 | And obviously, on top of the fact that we've had population explosions here in Knox County                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=534.0)  |
|     539 |   543 | and a few other areas of the state, lots changed since 2019,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=539.0)  |
|     543 |   548 | and this was just an opportunity to see, hey, where are we at?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=543.0)  |
|     548 |   550 | What is the impact, as you were saying?                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=548.0)  |
|     550 |   554 | So some of the focus areas are the calls for service and incident data.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=550.0)  |
|     554 |   560 | So there's some pretty extensive charts broken down by each fire station and district.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=554.0)  |
|     560 |   565 | So the fire stations that are in your communities,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=560.0)  |
|     565 |   570 | you'll be able to look at those specifically to see about coverage areas, response times,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=565.0)  |
|     570 |   573 | type of calls, those type things.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=570.0)  |
|     573 |   578 | Also looking at the apparatus, and just back on the service and incident data,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=573.0)  |
|     578 |   584 | we looked at about 21,000 calls in that one-year service period, took that,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=578.0)  |
|     584 |   586 | geolocated all of that information.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=584.0)  |
|     586 |   588 | I believe there was additional data that was provided,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=586.0)  |
|     588 |   594 | but some of those were duplicates where you had multiple departments responding together.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=588.0)  |
|     594 |   599 | Some of the highlights of that, the busiest stations, and it's been this way for a while,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=594.0)  |
|     599 |   604 | but Carnes is definitely on the rise, but Station 30 in Halls, 41 in Farragut,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=599.0)  |
|     604 |   606 | there on Campbell Station Road are the two busiest,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=604.0)  |
|     606 |   611 | and then the Carnes District 1 is right behind them with that.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=606.0)  |
|     611 |   616 | And that definitely goes in line with the growth that we'll show you here.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=611.0)  |
|     616 |   620 | As far as apparatus goes, there have been some changes,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=616.0)  |
|     620 |   625 | some positive changes, additions in the time period from 2019,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=620.0)  |
|     625 |   628 | which did affect some of the average age of the apparatus.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=625.0)  |
|     628 |   632 | The challenges with fire apparatus is that they're getting much more expensive                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=628.0)  |
|     632 |   638 | and they're also a significantly delayed timeline to get them from specifications                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=632.0)  |
|     638 |   641 | to on the ground and running.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=638.0)  |
|     641 |   646 | It's about 36 to 48 months to get a firetruck now, a new firetruck built,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=641.0)  |
|     646 |   650 | and that also increases about 8% of the cost per year.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=646.0)  |
|     650 |   654 | So when you look at the average ages, and you'll see that in the study there,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=650.0)  |
|     654 |   656 | kind of add four years on top of that.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=654.0)  |
|     656 |   659 | So if there are changes that the departments need to make,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=656.0)  |
|     659 |   663 | they're already four years behind the eight ball pretty much,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=659.0)  |
|     663 |   669 | and significantly the cost just continues to increase significantly.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=663.0)  |
|     669 |   673 | The service coverage area, we broke that down very extensively,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=669.0)  |
|     673 |   677 | so there's several pages dedicated to that.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=673.0)  |
|     677 |   679 | A very positive thing for here in Knox County,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=677.0)  |
|     679 |   681 | and all the departments should be committed for this                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=679.0)  |
|     681 |   684 | about where they've placed their fire stations,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=681.0)  |
|     684 |   688 | is that there is about 95.6% of the buildings in the county                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=684.0)  |
|     688 |   691 | are within five driving miles of a fire station.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=688.0)  |
|     691 |   695 | Very few places in the state have that,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=691.0)  |
|     695 |   698 | and especially for an area as concentrated as this                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=695.0)  |
|     698 |   701 | and also as challenging as the response district is,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=698.0)  |
|     701 |   704 | as you'll see on the map here in just a second.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=701.0)  |
|     704 |   709 | The significance of the five driving miles has to do with the ISO and insurance ratings,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=704.0)  |
|     709 |   713 | so anything over five driving miles is considered a Class 10                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=709.0)  |
|     713 |   717 | regardless of how good your fire department ISO ratings are.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=713.0)  |
|     717 |   720 | In Knox County, they have very good ISO ratings.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=717.0)  |
|     720 |   723 | You have a three, a four, and a five, I think,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=720.0)  |
|     723 |   725 | which from a residential perspective is very...                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=723.0)  |
|     725 |   730 | I mean, there's very little differences between that.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=725.0)  |
|     730 |   732 | And then the stations and response time.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=730.0)  |
|     732 |   734 | So we looked at 24.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=732.0)  |
|     734 |   736 | I think there's 24 stations in the county.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=734.0)  |
|     736 |   739 | Ten of those are 25 years or older.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=736.0)  |
|     739 |   742 | And there's a breakdown, there's a chart in the study as well,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=739.0)  |
|     742 |   746 | and it shows rural metro Carnes and Seymours.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=742.0)  |
|     746 |   751 | As you'll see, most rural metro stations are leased facilities,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=746.0)  |
|     751 |   756 | and that will, over time, will factor into decisions, I think,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=751.0)  |
|     756 |   759 | that would need to be made.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=756.0)  |
|     759 |   761 | The study area does include Farragut,                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=759.0)  |
|     761 |   763 | and the reason for that is, as you all know,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=761.0)  |
|     763 |   766 | they don't provide their own emergency services,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=763.0)  |
|     766 |   770 | so it was easier just to include them in looking at this as a whole                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=766.0)  |
|     770 |   773 | as opposed to signaling them out with Knoxville,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=770.0)  |
|     773 |   778 | which has its own fire department emergency services.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=773.0)  |
|     778 |   783 | So this map here shows you the station, the districts for each station.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=778.0)  |
|     783 |   787 | So it's a little complicated when you're looking at,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=783.0)  |
|     787 |   789 | well, whose department is what.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=787.0)  |
|     789 |   792 | As you see on the southeast side there,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=789.0)  |
|     792 |   796 | you have Seymour, and Seymour has two stations inside Knox County.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=792.0)  |
|     796 |   798 | And for the purpose of the study,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=796.0)  |
|     798 |   801 | we just combined those into one response area.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=798.0)  |
|     801 |   805 | They also have an additional, I think, five stations                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=801.0)  |
|     805 |   809 | in Blount and Sevier County that come into Knox County to help                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=805.0)  |
|     809 |   814 | and vice versa, the stations here go over there to help as well.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=809.0)  |
|     814 |   819 | Carnes has four stations, and we combined those into two districts.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=814.0)  |
|     819 |   824 | And the reason for that is that you have two stations that are staffed 24 hours a day,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=819.0)  |
|     824 |   828 | and then they have two stations that are just house apparatus.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=824.0)  |
|     828 |   831 | There's no ability to staff those stations,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=828.0)  |
|     831 |   836 | so it was easier to combine those to looking at that.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=831.0)  |
|     836 |   839 | And then all the rest of the stations and the districts up there                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=836.0)  |
|     839 |   846 | are rural metro's response districts.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=839.0)  |
|     846 |   851 | If anybody has any questions as we go along, please feel free to ask.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=846.0)  |
|     851 |   858 | So this next map here is using the GIS tools that we have                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=851.0)  |
|     858 |   864 | and placing all the business and houses in the models.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=858.0)  |
|     864 |   868 | This is basically a heat map showing where your concentration of buildings are.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=864.0)  |
|     869 |   875 | And as you can see, the transportation corridors west,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=869.0)  |
|     875 |   878 | much more concentrated, as you all know,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=875.0)  |
|     878 |   881 | so none of this is really any groundbreaking information for you,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=878.0)  |
|     881 |   884 | but it does show those densities of that.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=881.0)  |
|     884 |   889 | A very positive thing is that where the fire stations have been located                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=884.0)  |
|     889 |   893 | are, for the most part, really within those concentrated areas.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=889.0)  |
|     893 |   896 | So what that does is that that helps response times                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=893.0)  |
|     896 |   901 | because where the concentrations of the development is                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=896.0)  |
|     901 |   904 | is typically where the concentrations of incidents are,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=901.0)  |
|     904 |   908 | and we found that to be true.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=904.0)  |
|     908 |   913 | So one thing that we look at when we're looking at where you're at                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=908.0)  |
|     913 |   915 | is where you've been.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=913.0)  |
|     915 |   922 | And so taking permit data for residential and commercial and remodel and stuff                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=915.0)  |
|     922 |   927 | and plotting that, and then breaking that out by fire station.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=922.0)  |
|     927 |   931 | So as you see here, both of the Karnes stations                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=927.0)  |
|     931 |   936 | have a pretty high peak as far as construction goes.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=931.0)  |
|     936 |   943 | You also, Halls, which is Station 30, is coming in there second for 2021,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=936.0)  |
|     943 |   949 | and then Farragut with 41 and 42, those as well.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=943.0)  |
|     949 |   954 | So all areas did have growth.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=949.0)  |
|     954 |   956 | Some of those were pretty exponential,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=954.0)  |
|     956 |   963 | and when you're looking at a percentage of increase from 2010 to 2020,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=956.0)  |
|     963 |   969 | some of the impacts are pretty significant.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=963.0)  |
|     969 |   974 | Here's a breakdown by district of the populations,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=969.0)  |
|     974 |   976 | and the interesting thing about Knox County is,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=974.0)  |
|     976 |   980 | and I know that I had looked at this a few years ago,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=976.0)  |
|     980 |   982 | and it may or may not still be true,                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=980.0)  |
|     982 |   986 | but I think Knox County has the highest population percentage                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=982.0)  |
|     986 |   991 | outside of the major city limits than any other county in the state.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=986.0)  |
|     991 |   997 | So if it's not still true, it's definitely very high up there,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=991.0)  |
|     997 |  1000 | but typically most other places in the state                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=997.0)  |
|    1000 |  1004 | have very little commercial outside the city limits,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1000.0) |
|    1004 |  1010 | and the percentages of population are typically within incorporated areas.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1004.0) |
|    1010 |  1018 | So as you see here, the total study area increased by 14.2% over 10 years,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1010.0) |
|    1018 |  1019 | and that's a significant amount,                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1018.0) |
|    1019 |  1025 | especially when you're looking at the baseline of 252,000 in 2010.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1019.0) |
|    1025 |  1029 | Karnes grew quite a bit, so about a third increase                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1025.0) |
|    1029 |  1033 | in the size and density of that, and as you drive through there,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1029.0) |
|    1033 |  1034 | at least as I have here lately,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1033.0) |

|    1036 |  1044 | I'm just pretty amazed by all the growth, both the density as well as the size.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1036.0) |
|    1044 |  1047 | So that kind of led into, and this was done independently,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1044.0) |
|    1047 |  1054 | but I believe that the planning did an advanced Knox study recently                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1047.0) |
|    1054 |  1057 | that did show the impacts of the growth.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1054.0) |
|    1057 |  1059 | Some of the facts from that is, you know,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1057.0) |
|    1060 |  1064 | Knox County is in the top 5% in the country for growth                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1060.0) |
|    1064 |  1069 | as far as its population size.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1064.0) |

|    1071 |  1076 | So whether you're looking at fire, rescue, EMS, law enforcement,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1071.0) |
|    1076 |  1081 | it all has to do, it all impacts emergency services,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1076.0) |
|    1081 |  1084 | and emergency services are also one of those quality of life measures                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1081.0) |
|    1084 |  1087 | that sometimes are hard to, they're kind of hard to quantify,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1084.0) |
|    1087 |  1089 | but those are things that people are looking at                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1087.0) |
|    1089 |  1093 | when they're bringing in development and businesses                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1089.0) |
|    1093 |  1097 | as well as just feeling safe in their communities.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1093.0) |
|    1097 |  1102 | So with that in mind, you know, it's definitely important for the commission                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1097.0) |
|    1102 |  1109 | to be looking at that public safety, emergency services side of the growth                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1102.0) |
|    1109 |  1118 | as these plans come down the pike and are looked at.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1109.0) |
|    1118 |  1123 | I told you this was a Cliff Notes version of what we got back in April.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1118.0) |
|    1123 |  1129 | So some of the major recommendations in that,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1123.0) |
|    1129 |  1134 | and training facilities is a challenge.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1129.0) |
|    1134 |  1138 | One, from a cost to build training facilities,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1134.0) |
|    1138 |  1143 | but also to make it relevant for the departments to be prepared.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1138.0) |
|    1143 |  1149 | The number of fires, generally speaking, across the country are decreasing.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1143.0) |
|    1149 |  1156 | When I and this young man got on the job many moons ago,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1149.0) |
|    1156 |  1159 | and we actually worked on a truck together a time or two,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1156.0) |
|    1159 |  1162 | and we had a lot of fires.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1159.0) |
|    1162 |  1167 | And so while we had the great, you know, we did training program obviously,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1162.0) |
|    1167 |  1170 | but there was that continual amount of fires that were going on                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1167.0) |
|    1170 |  1175 | that you were helping to kind of hone your skills and stuff.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1170.0) |
|    1175 |  1178 | Now fire departments have to spend an extensive amount of time                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1175.0) |
|    1178 |  1182 | to recreate those opportunities that you just don't see every single day                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1178.0) |
|    1182 |  1186 | because if it's your house that's on fire or your family's house that's on fire,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1182.0) |
|    1186 |  1188 | they've got to be ready all the time.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1186.0) |
|    1188 |  1191 | And so training is a very huge thing.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1188.0) |
|    1191 |  1195 | Fire departments are also becoming more of an all-hazards agency,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1191.0) |
|    1195 |  1199 | and that occurrence has been happening over the last couple decades.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1195.0) |
|    1199 |  1201 | But they do everything.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1199.0) |
|    1201 |  1207 | So from obviously fire response to emergency medical responses,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1201.0) |
|    1207 |  1210 | hazardous materials, rescue,                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1207.0) |
|    1210 |  1217 | they have to have the ability to develop those skills as well as to maintain those.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1210.0) |
|    1217 |  1222 | So training facilities is something that I had mentioned back in the previous study,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1217.0) |
|    1222 |  1226 | and it's a challenge because as you see the geography of the county,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1222.0) |
|    1226 |  1229 | what a big area that is,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1226.0) |
|    1229 |  1233 | the best case scenario is something more centrally located,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1229.0) |
|    1233 |  1239 | or the second best scenario would be maybe two smaller facilities in different areas                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1233.0) |
|    1239 |  1241 | so that you're not drawing from one extreme                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1239.0) |
|    1241 |  1245 | because it takes a while to get from one end of the county to the other                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1241.0) |
|    1245 |  1249 | and to take those units out of service for that amount of time.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1245.0) |
|    1249 |  1257 | Fire stations and equipment, that's something that I see is a big need.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1249.0) |
|    1257 |  1263 | Not only the fact that you have aging facilities that are here,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1257.0) |
|    1263 |  1266 | very few are actually owned,                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1263.0) |
|    1266 |  1273 | and then also those that are here lack what we consider the same standards                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1266.0) |
|    1273 |  1275 | when building new facilities.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1273.0) |
|    1275 |  1278 | So as a public safety facility as a whole,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1275.0) |
|    1278 |  1280 | you're looking at hardened facilities,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1278.0) |
|    1280 |  1283 | something that's going to endure that severe storm that comes along,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1280.0) |
|    1283 |  1289 | that's able to operate when the power is out for two or three or four days or longer                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1283.0) |
|    1289 |  1293 | and have more resilience.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1289.0) |
|    1293 |  1304 | So as the growth occurs, as the demands from an incident side increase,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1293.0) |
|    1304 |  1308 | the five-mile standard is probably going to be decreased                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1304.0) |
|    1308 |  1312 | because just like in the city, you have stations that are closer together                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1308.0) |
|    1312 |  1316 | because of population and call volume and stuff.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1312.0) |
|    1316 |  1323 | So that is something that the county can look into, in my opinion,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1316.0) |
|    1323 |  1326 | as far as investing in public safety.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1323.0) |
|    1326 |  1329 | And it's not just from a fire safety perspective,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1326.0) |
|    1329 |  1334 | but these facilities can be used by all the emergency services.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1329.0) |
|    1334 |  1336 | One thing that I've recommended across the state                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1334.0) |
|    1336 |  1340 | and several counties are doing is kind of have an all-hazard substations                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1336.0) |
|    1340 |  1346 | where you have fire apparatus and quarters for EMS as well as rescue                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1340.0) |
|    1346 |  1351 | and even emergency management with other specialized tools and equipment.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1346.0) |
|    1351 |  1355 | A lot of them are also putting in a small police precinct,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1351.0) |
|    1355 |  1359 | so when the sheriff's office can come, they can come by there and do their reports.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1355.0) |
|    1359 |  1362 | They can get on, if they're having issues with their Internet in their car,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1359.0) |
|    1362 |  1364 | they can get in there.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1362.0) |
|    1364 |  1366 | They can use the facilities.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1364.0) |
|    1366 |  1369 | They can take just a little bit of a decompression break                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1366.0) |
|    1369 |  1372 | and still be right there in that community.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1369.0) |
|    1372 |  1376 | The advantages of that are obviously we're not building different things                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1372.0) |

|    1382 |  1387 | but also it gives you that investment of knowing that no matter what,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1382.0) |
|    1387 |  1390 | the county owns that piece of property and they own that facility,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1387.0) |
|    1390 |  1396 | and if things change in the future, then you've got some infrastructure that's in place.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1390.0) |
|    1396 |  1403 | And then the last one as far as the coordination goes on there is the bullet point,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1396.0) |
|    1403 |  1411 | is that the next step in moving forward with fire protection in the county                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1403.0) |
|    1411 |  1420 | is for the county to consider the, lost my words here,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1411.0) |
|    1420 |  1425 | basically enacting the Knox County Fire Rescue Department,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1420.0) |
|    1425 |  1429 | and that's allowed by statute 517-101.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1425.0) |
|    1429 |  1434 | And what that does is that that can mean several different things,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1429.0) |
|    1434 |  1439 | and what I would foresee for Knox County is that that's that umbrella organization                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1434.0) |
|    1439 |  1446 | that is invested in providing services to the citizens and visitors of the county.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1439.0) |
|    1446 |  1450 | The existing departments can still remain, and I would encourage that,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1446.0) |
|    1450 |  1456 | but you could also at that time start entering into more performance-based contracts                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1450.0) |
|    1456 |  1464 | to where that way there's some checks and balances in the services that are being delivered.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1456.0) |
|    1464 |  1469 | It also allows the county to kind of step in, and where you have private departments in the state,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1464.0) |
|    1469 |  1474 | they're not always eligible for some of the other opportunities and grants and other stuff,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1469.0) |
|    1474 |  1481 | and the county can step in of, hey, this is a functional arm by contract of the county,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1474.0) |
|    1481 |  1486 | and be able to help support some of those additional opportunities that come along.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1481.0) |
|    1486 |  1489 | That's it in a nutshell.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1486.0) |
|    1489 |  1492 | There is some more, obviously, in the report.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1489.0) |
|    1492 |  1498 | It does go into more details, but hopefully I wrote it in a way that you can zone in                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1492.0) |
|    1498 |  1503 | and hone in on your areas if you have more interest in that.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1498.0) |
|    1503 |  1508 | Thank you, sir. Commissioner Schoonmaker.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1503.0) |
|    1508 |  1511 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1508.0) |
|    1511 |  1515 | By the way, I did have my report from 2019,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1511.0) |
|    1515 |  1520 | and I see you went from 57 pages up to about the same amount.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1515.0) |
|    1520 |  1529 | But my question is, looking at the apparatus chart, for instance, rural metro,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1520.0) |
|    1529 |  1534 | it's my understanding with the movement to electric vehicles                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1529.0) |
|    1534 |  1543 | that a typical internal combustion engine car fire requires about 500 gallons of water to put it out.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1534.0) |
|    1543 |  1550 | And I understand with a pure electric vehicle, it could be upwards of about 5,000 gallons.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1543.0) |
|    1550 |  1555 | But yet none of the apparatus can hold that kind of quantity.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1550.0) |
|    1555 |  1561 | So in an electric vehicle fire, you're going to have to send multiple equipment                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1555.0) |
|    1561 |  1564 | as opposed to one on an internal combustion engine.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1561.0) |
|    1564 |  1571 | So in your recommendations, did you suggest that with the implementation of more electric cars                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1564.0) |
|    1571 |  1577 | that they need to look at different kinds of equipment to hold more water to handle those needs?                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1571.0) |
|    1577 |  1582 | So I did not get into the electric vehicle, but you're absolutely right as far as that goes.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1577.0) |
|    1582 |  1587 | It will take, if you're using the apparatus that they have now, a significant amount of those                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1582.0) |
|    1587 |  1594 | to be able to deliver the initial water as well as probably go back and get more water to bring to that.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1587.0) |
|    1594 |  1600 | In the past, a house fire could be put out with well under 5,000 gallons of water.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1594.0) |
|    1600 |  1604 | Actually, ISO has a much lower threshold for that initial response.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1600.0) |
|    1604 |  1615 | So those are things that, as technology changes and as your impacts of the community do change,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1604.0) |
|    1616 |  1621 | I hate to give him a plug, but that's a perfect example of why you have a public safety director                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1616.0) |
|    1621 |  1627 | that is looking at that granular level of that and making those recommendations.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1621.0) |
|    1627 |  1635 | But your facts are spot on, so good job on your research on that one.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1627.0) |

|    1641 |  1647 | I also looked through the other recommendation.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1641.0) |
|    1647 |  1653 | Was it 2019 that we sort of started the conversation and then it quickly died about, you know,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1647.0) |
|    1653 |  1656 | what does Knox County do as it continues to grow?                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1653.0) |
|    1656 |  1663 | Are you aware of any other county in the state of Tennessee or a neighboring state that, you know,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1656.0) |
|    1663 |  1670 | grew to our size and essentially went from a service in which we don't pay for but we contract                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1663.0) |
|    1670 |  1678 | this private sector and convert it into a public sector as recommended where we contract it                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1670.0) |
|    1678 |  1682 | and begin paying for services directly?                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1678.0) |
|    1682 |  1690 | So the model here is very unique with Rural Metro being your majority provider                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1682.0) |
|    1690 |  1694 | and how that grew out of the smaller volunteer departments.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1690.0) |
|    1694 |  1696 | It's in the 2019 state.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1694.0) |
|    1696 |  1699 | We kind of walked through that progression there.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1696.0) |
|    1699 |  1705 | In the state, not only here in the Knox County area, I live in Murfreesboro,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1699.0) |
|    1705 |  1710 | and it's, you know, it's exploding as well, and all the area around Nashville is.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1705.0) |
|    1710 |  1715 | And those counties are really struggling with some of the same stuff that you are.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1710.0) |
|    1715 |  1723 | And while they have invested by donation, just similar to what Knox County has with giving Karns                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1715.0) |
|    1723 |  1727 | and Seymour and the Rescue Squad a donation over the last couple years,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1723.0) |
|    1727 |  1735 | they're looking at, okay, we've, our public is kind of demanding a higher level of service,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1727.0) |
|    1735 |  1738 | and we also want to have more control over that.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1735.0) |
|    1738 |  1745 | So several of them have gone to a more, they're into the fire business themselves,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1738.0) |
|    1745 |  1754 | and even more so than what this recommendation is, and not saying necessarily forcefully taking over,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1745.0) |
|    1754 |  1758 | but definitely encouraging the consolidation of departments.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1754.0) |
|    1758 |  1764 | Most counties have anywhere from 5 to 10, 12 volunteer departments.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1758.0) |
|    1764 |  1768 | So a benefit that you have here in Knox County is that you only have three departments,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1764.0) |
|    1768 |  1772 | so it is easier to coordinate.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1768.0) |
|    1772 |  1776 | But are you aware of one that, a county that's actually made the switch?                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1772.0) |
|    1776 |  1781 | I know everybody's talking about this, but is one, like can you say here is a comparable-sized county                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1776.0) |
|    1782 |  1786 | and they went from not paying a dollar and working with private entity partners                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1782.0) |
|    1786 |  1791 | to saying we're going to take this on and start spending taxpayer money and convert to this system?                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1786.0) |
|    1791 |  1794 | Yeah, Rutherford County is one, and that's where I live.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1791.0) |
|    1794 |  1796 | So it's gone through the transition.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1794.0) |
|    1796 |  1799 | And how long has that been and how has it gone on?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1796.0) |
|    1799 |  1802 | They passed the Rutherford County Fire Rescue in 2010.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1799.0) |
|    1802 |  1805 | That was three of the original departments became that,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1802.0) |
|    1805 |  1810 | and then they did the contract with the other volunteer departments.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1805.0) |
|    1810 |  1815 | And then over time, the departments have just one or two at a time have come in.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1810.0) |
|    1815 |  1819 | I think there's still two or three volunteer departments that are left that are independent,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1815.0) |
|    1819 |  1823 | but they're on a contract with the county, and so they get a certain amount of money.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1819.0) |
|    1823 |  1827 | The county supplies their apparatus, their air packs, their turnout gear,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1823.0) |
|    1827 |  1829 | so they're getting a lot of that.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1827.0) |
|    1829 |  1832 | Williamson County is similar as well.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1829.0) |
|    1832 |  1835 | They still are mostly in the volunteer,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1832.0) |
|    1835 |  1839 | but they've consolidated down to two or three volunteer departments,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1835.0) |
|    1839 |  1845 | and they provide stations, apparatus, all of the hard cost.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1839.0) |
|    1845 |  1854 | So the departments themselves, maybe uniforms and some just specific things that they want.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1845.0) |
|    1854 |  1856 | How is that worked with?                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1854.0) |
|    1856 |  1859 | Right now we have a private entity that is spending their own capital,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1856.0) |
|    1859 |  1865 | even though they may get financial support from us, to put in Station 30 and halls.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1859.0) |
|    1865 |  1866 | They own that.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1865.0) |
|    1866 |  1867 | They own the property.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1866.0) |

|    1869 |  1870 | They own the building.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1869.0) |
|    1870 |  1871 | They own the equipment.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1870.0) |
|    1871 |  1878 | If Knox County were to contract, would they continue to own all those assets,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1871.0) |
|    1878 |  1885 | or would Knox County be in the business of asset management as well and taking all those?                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1878.0) |
|    1885 |  1887 | It would depend upon how your contract would go.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1885.0) |
|    1887 |  1893 | The way that I would foresee that is that, as things are now, they would maintain that.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1887.0) |
|    1893 |  1898 | But there's a few of their stations that are in need of either movement or replacement                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1893.0) |
|    1898 |  1903 | based upon just the conditions that they're there,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1898.0) |
|    1903 |  1910 | and those would be what I would suggest looking at as maybe the first investment that the county has                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1903.0) |
|    1910 |  1915 | in helping to put a hard facility that the county owns,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1910.0) |
|    1915 |  1919 | enter into a cooperative agreement with them to operate it.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1915.0) |
|    1919 |  1922 | That could be one of those dollar a year things or whatever the case may be.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1919.0) |
|    1922 |  1928 | That way the county would start having some investment in infrastructure,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1922.0) |
|    1928 |  1932 | but they would still be responsible for most of that.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1928.0) |
|    1932 |  1937 | Commissioner Daley, maybe you can help me with this.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1932.0) |
|    1937 |  1943 | Is the committee taking this and actively trying to figure out how does it apply to Knox County                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1937.0) |
|    1943 |  1945 | and beginning to make recommendations?                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1943.0) |
|    1945 |  1947 | Because we did go through this in 2019.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1945.0) |
|    1947 |  1949 | We had a great discussion.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1947.0) |
|    1949 |  1955 | Everyone said this is wonderful, and then as soon as anybody said it's going to cost a dollar,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1949.0) |
|    1955 |  1959 | they all went, nope, and we stuck it on a shelf, and here we are four years later.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1955.0) |
|    1959 |  1965 | Is the goal of redoing this today to then spark a plan for what do we do in the future,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1959.0) |
|    1965 |  1970 | or is this going to sit on a shelf for four more years and we'll revisit?                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1965.0) |
|    1970 |  1971 | Great question.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1970.0) |
|    1971 |  1975 | Mr. VanDeVate, come on down if you would.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1971.0) |
|    1975 |  1980 | I don't think this study was, the study is to see what we need and where we're at.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1975.0) |

|    1983 |  1985 | I don't see it at this time.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1983.0) |
|    1985 |  1991 | Mr. VanDeVate was our chair for two years, and do we need some action?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1985.0) |
|    1991 |  1998 | I like the idea of the county owning the building or owning the apparatus                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1991.0) |
|    1998 |  1999 | and contracting it out.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1998.0) |
|    1999 |  2003 | It's easier for the volunteer fire department.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1999.0) |

|    2011 |  2017 | We're pretty deep into what our various options might be,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2011.0) |
|    2017 |  2023 | but we always want to come back to our starting place, which is if it isn't broken, don't fix it.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2017.0) |
|    2024 |  2029 | If you think about fire protection from the standpoint just operationally of                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2024.0) |
|    2029 |  2035 | are lives being lost, is property being lost, are there issues of underperformance,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2029.0) |
|    2035 |  2038 | then the answer to that is no.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2035.0) |

|    2064 |  2068 | provide more investment and more support in these agencies,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2064.0) |
|    2068 |  2071 | but not necessarily insource them.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2068.0) |
|    2071 |  2072 | There's no need.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2071.0) |
|    2072 |  2075 | They're functioning well.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2072.0) |
|    2076 |  2082 | into a place where we have a framework that, as Mr. Lauer said,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2076.0) |
|    2082 |  2085 | allows us to have performance-based contracts,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2082.0) |
|    2085 |  2089 | where we can both set expectations that we have of the agencies,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2085.0) |
|    2089 |  2093 | and the agencies can come to us and say, here are our expectations of you.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2089.0) |
|    2093 |  2096 | Right now, that relationship just sort of exists in the ether.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2093.0) |
|    2096 |  2104 | A great starting place is this creation of a fire department, as Mr. Lauer recommended,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2096.0) |
|    2104 |  2107 | which is fundamentally just a structure that creates a department and a chief,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2104.0) |
|    2107 |  2112 | and that chief would have the ability to execute contracts with the agencies,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2107.0) |
|    2112 |  2115 | and those contracts can set these kind of standards,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2112.0) |
|    2115 |  2118 | whether they're NFPA standards or whatever they might be,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2115.0) |
|    2118 |  2121 | and expectations that the two parties have of each other.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2118.0) |
|    2121 |  2123 | That is the model that the town of Farragut uses.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2121.0) |
|    2123 |  2125 | The town of Farragut actually has a contract with Rural Metro.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2123.0) |
|    2125 |  2129 | Knox County does not.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2125.0) |
|    2130 |  2135 | I think our initial step would be just to try to formalize the framework                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2130.0) |
|    2135 |  2142 | and put contracts in place that let the agencies continue to do the good work that they do,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2135.0) |
|    2142 |  2144 | but give us an opportunity to support them.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2142.0) |
|    2144 |  2148 | It is particularly challenging with Rural Metro.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2144.0) |
|    2148 |  2153 | We cannot, nor should we, buy assets for a private for-profit corporation                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2148.0) |
|    2153 |  2155 | that are going to be owned by that corporation.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2153.0) |
|    2155 |  2158 | On the other hand, that corporation is providing vitally needed service                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2155.0) |
|    2158 |  2160 | to the majority of our citizens.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2158.0) |
|    2160 |  2163 | So is it a reasonable thing, as Commissioner Daley alluded to,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2160.0) |
|    2163 |  2170 | if we were to build fire stations and they would operate those stations on our behalf?                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2163.0) |
|    2170 |  2172 | We could do that with any of these agencies.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2170.0) |
|    2172 |  2173 | Certainly we could do it with Carnes.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2172.0) |
|    2173 |  2174 | It would make sense there.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2173.0) |
|    2174 |  2177 | It would make sense with Rural Metro.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2174.0) |
|    2177 |  2180 | But the county would be the property owner,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2177.0) |
|    2180 |  2182 | and the agency would provide the service.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2180.0) |
|    2182 |  2184 | So I don't know if that helps,                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2182.0) |
|    2184 |  2187 | but that's just sort of an early overview of where we see this going.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2184.0) |
|    2187 |  2188 | It does.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2187.0) |
|    2188 |  2192 | We've created a new position that we didn't have before,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2188.0) |
|    2192 |  2198 | so we're creating a new level of bureaucracy to begin heading in some direction.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2192.0) |
|    2198 |  2202 | Otherwise, we wouldn't have a new director and we wouldn't spend all this time.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2198.0) |
|    2202 |  2205 | Because if it wasn't broken, we didn't need to fix it.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2202.0) |
|    2205 |  2208 | We'd just keep on moving along and we wouldn't have a new director, right?                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2205.0) |
|    2208 |  2211 | Well, could we substitute accountability for bureaucracy?                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2208.0) |

|    2215 |  2216 | I'll give you that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2215.0) |
|    2216 |  2221 | But I continue to wonder,                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2216.0) |
|    2221 |  2228 | I've always struggled on how do we reconcile taking taxpayer dollars every year                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2221.0) |
|    2228 |  2230 | into the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2228.0) |
|    2230 |  2235 | to support agencies for-profit and non-profit and volunteer,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2230.0) |
|    2235 |  2239 | yet we're taking the taxpayer dollars from somebody and saying,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2235.0) |

|    2253 |  2257 | and at some point we need to pick a side.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2253.0) |

|    3137 |  3144 | Is this some kind of name change or is this?                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3137.0) |
|    3144 |  3154 | This one results from I think they're selling out to this other company.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3144.0) |
|    3154 |  3159 | So it's an assignment of the contract.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3154.0) |
|    3159 |  3166 | And so instead of going through TVA, of course, which they did before, they have to go through                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3159.0) |

|    3167 |  3168 | And so this is why this is before you.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3167.0) |

|    3334 |  3342 | Well, I guess, yeah, several.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3334.0) |
|    3342 |  3343 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3342.0) |
|    3343 |  3353 | First off, it's my understanding that Clingman's Dome was named for a Democrat U.S.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3343.0) |
|    3353 |  3355 | Senator back in 1858.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3353.0) |
|    3355 |  3362 | So 165 years ago, that's how Clingman's Dome arrived by its name.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3355.0) |
|    3362 |  3363 | Is that correct?                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3362.0) |
|    3364 |  3371 | So, since time immemorial, it has been named Kewohee.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3364.0) |
|    3371 |  3377 | There are plenty of historical maps that show the historical name as Kewohee, but you are                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3371.0) |
|    3377 |  3384 | correct that it was renamed in 1858 after Thomas Clingman, who was a North Carolina                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3377.0) |
|    3384 |  3385 | senator.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3384.0) |
|    3385 |  3386 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3385.0) |
|    3387 |  3397 | And then Blount County, Tennessee, who adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, has                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3387.0) |
|    3397 |  3400 | not participated in this process.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3397.0) |
|    3402 |  3410 | So, to date, in Tennessee, we do have the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club, the Oak Ridge                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3402.0) |

|    3418 |  3423 | County would be the first county commission to lend its support to our cause.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3418.0) |
|    3424 |  3425 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3424.0) |
|    3425 |  3430 | And then the Tennessee House of Representatives has not taken up this issue, and also my                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3425.0) |
|    3430 |  3436 | understanding that the Tennessee Senate has not addressed this issue either.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3430.0) |

|    3492 |  3498 | The mountain itself is Kewohee, and that is the original name of the mountain.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3492.0) |

|    3512 |  3515 | The process is to restore the mountain's name.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3512.0) |
|    3516 |  3523 | Okay, but in our resolution, we say the mountain, but we don't, there's no reference to say                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3516.0) |

|    3530 |  3534 | which is probably, and that's the highest point in the state of Tennessee.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3530.0) |
|    3535 |  3545 | I think that it will be up to maybe the park or the U.S. Board to see whether or not the                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3535.0) |

|    3570 |  3581 | I think ultimately, the idea is that if, when the name is restored to Kewohee, that the                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3570.0) |
|    3581 |  3585 | observation tower could possibly be renamed as well.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3581.0) |

|    3593 |  3599 | that's known worldwide as Clingman's Dome, and then to change it to something else, it                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3593.0) |

|    3735 |  3744 | Since we do have you here, I think it's important, if you can do it kind of in a little synopsis of what this                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3735.0) |
|    3744 |  3755 | land actually means to the Cherokees, and why you guys feel like it is so important to be able to get this                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3744.0) |

|    3773 |  3780 | So I think Tennessee and Knox County is a great opportunity to be able to start, and then to know that our                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3773.0) |

|    3785 |  3789 | But if you want to take a minute and just kind of explain that to the commission, I think it would be great.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3785.0) |

|    4020 |  4031 | Oh, and then a few weeks ago, they allowed Cherokee to partner with Yo-Yo Ma and have a performance there.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4020.0) |
|    4031 |  4036 | So, the Park Service is helping with educational opportunities.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4031.0) |
|    4037 |  4041 | Now, the Park Service is—who does the application? The Park Service?                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4037.0) |
|    4042 |  4052 | No. In this instance, we're—me, a member of the Eastern Band, and my friend-slash-sister, Mary Crow,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4042.0) |
|    4052 |  4055 | we're going to do the application ourselves.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4052.0) |
|    4055 |  4061 | It's two people. We're going to submit an application to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4055.0) |
|    4061 |  4066 | and then they will determine, approve, or deny our application.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4061.0) |
|    4067 |  4072 | Is the mountain itself named Clean Winds Mountain?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4067.0) |
|    4073 |  4077 | The whole mountain is actually named Clean Winds Dome.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4073.0) |
|    4077 |  4082 | It's confusing, though, because the observation tower is there on the top of the mountain.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4077.0) |
|    4082 |  4085 | So, we're not asking, rename that structure.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4082.0) |
|    4086 |  4095 | We're asking, restore the historical, cultural name, Kewokee, to the mountain.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4086.0) |
|    4096 |  4103 | Is this the only mountain, or are you going to go after Mount LeConte next, or which mountains is next on the list?                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4096.0) |
|    4104 |  4107 | So, I don't have a list.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4104.0) |
|    4108 |  4118 | I know that there are places that maybe other people have in mind, but I don't have a list.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4108.0) |
|    4118 |  4127 | This is my goal. This is something that I've worked very hard on for eight months, and I will continue to work on.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4118.0) |
|    4127 |  4130 | So, this is it for me.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4127.0) |
|    4131 |  4134 | I don't understand why the Park Service is not behind you.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4131.0) |
|    4135 |  4137 | Why is not the Park Service behind you?                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4135.0) |
|    4141 |  4147 | I think because they just don't take an official stance on these things.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4141.0) |
|    4147 |  4153 | If the U.S. Board on Geographic Names says, we approve this application, we're going to name it,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4147.0) |
|    4153 |  4156 | and then they'll do the work from there.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4153.0) |
|    4156 |  4161 | But I don't think they're going to take a stance to support or oppose.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4156.0) |
|    4162 |  4163 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4162.0) |
|    4164 |  4166 | Thank you. Commissioner Lundy.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4164.0) |
|    4168 |  4172 | Ms. Hill, I just want to say thank you for your work.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4168.0) |
|    4172 |  4177 | I know your efforts are not easy, reclaiming the land.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4172.0) |
|    4177 |  4181 | I think that's why it's so important for people to know the true history.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4177.0) |
|    4183 |  4190 | We are living in a time that certain states want to deny people's history and keep people from knowing it.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4183.0) |
|    4190 |  4198 | So, this is a great economic and community development opportunity for people to know who had the land first.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4190.0) |
|    4199 |  4203 | Continue to do your work. I am praying for you and standing with you. Thank you.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4199.0) |
|    4204 |  4206 | Thank you very much.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4204.0) |
|    4207 |  4208 | Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4207.0) |
|    4209 |  4212 | Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Hill, I also want to thank you.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4209.0) |
|    4212 |  4219 | I know looking at me you couldn't tell, but my maternal grandfather is of Cherokee descent.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4212.0) |
|    4220 |  4227 | And I actually had a small business that was named Ioka, which in the Cherokee native language means she brought happiness.                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4220.0) |
|    4228 |  4234 | So, I'm thrilled to sign on to this and I wish you well in your efforts. Thank you.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4228.0) |
|    4235 |  4236 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4235.0) |
|    4237 |  4238 | Commissioner Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4237.0) |
|    4238 |  4248 | Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm not sure who you're talking to off to your side there, but I do try to do my homework before a meeting.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4238.0) |
|    4249 |  4257 | And there is a House joint resolution, but it's still in the subcommittee of the Natural Resources and Agricultural Committee.                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4249.0) |
|    4258 |  4265 | So, the House of Representatives and the Tennessee Senate have not, according to the information I've been looking at,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4258.0) |
|    4265 |  4273 | have not, you know, followed through on the sponsoring of changing the name for Clingman's Dome.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4265.0) |
|    4274 |  4280 | So, you may want to ask your colleague to your right, if they've got the information, to please send that to us.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4274.0) |
|    4281 |  4288 | But the Tennessee General Assembly says it's still in committee and hasn't moved since February of this year.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4281.0) |
|    4288 |  4298 | So, the person to my right is actually my husband and I don't know if you can see him. Sorry.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4288.0) |
|    4299 |  4310 | We are actually out of town. We're in Kansas currently, but we're out here for the World Series and we'll be watching Tennessee later tonight.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4299.0) |
|    4311 |  4323 | So, he does a lot of the work with me. He does all the traveling to anywhere that we go for talks, for educational purposes, for anything.              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4311.0) |
|    4324 |  4333 | But we have a picture and we are, sorry, I have the actual document in my office that has all the approvals on it.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4324.0) |
|    4334 |  4344 | I'm happy to forward a copy of that. I do have a picture of it on my Facebook account with Mary Crow.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4334.0) |
|    4345 |  4356 | Representative Justin Jones did mail that to us. So, we have the fully signed thing, a document, but the document number, what was the document number? | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4345.0) |
|    4356 |  4370 | HR, you said? The document number is 452. But I am more than happy to email a copy of that.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4356.0) |
|    4371 |  4379 | I can send it to Court because I do have her email address and then she could share.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4371.0) |
|    4380 |  4383 | Thank you, Ms. Hill. That would be appreciated.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4380.0) |
|    4383 |  4384 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4383.0) |
|    4385 |  4393 | Commissioners, I also want to add that we are, since we are the first stop, we are the only county commission that has taken this up.                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4385.0) |
|    4394 |  4397 | However, we are not the only ones that will be considering it.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4394.0) |
|    4398 |  4403 | For example, County Commission in Campbell County will be bringing it next month.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4398.0) |
|    4404 |  4406 | One of their commissioners will be bringing it next month.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4404.0) |
|    4406 |  4413 | A very similar resolution, if not the same, with just name changes as far as which commission is adopting it.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4406.0) |
|    4414 |  4418 | So, that will be going forward in July in Campbell County.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4414.0) |
|    4419 |  4429 | And again, this is not, as Ms. Hill has said, this is not the first mountain that has been renamed or restored back to its original name.               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4419.0) |
|    4430 |  4437 | Previously, Denali was Mount McKinley and now it is Denali in Denali National Park.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4430.0) |
|    4438 |  4441 | And so this is not something out of the ordinary.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4438.0) |
|    4442 |  4446 | This is just a restoration of that prior history.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4442.0) |
|    4447 |  4450 | And so all this does is just say we support their efforts.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4447.0) |
|    4451 |  4456 | Whether or not they get it, that's up to the U.S. Geological Board and naming.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4451.0) |
|    4456 |  4458 | So, that's all this is.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4456.0) |
|    4459 |  4461 | Is there any more discussion regarding this item?                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4459.0) |
|    4465 |  4473 | Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Lee.           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4465.0) |
|    4474 |  4476 | All those in favor, say aye. Aye.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4474.0) |
|    4477 |  4479 | Any opposed? That motion carries.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4477.0) |
|    4480 |  4483 | Ms. Hill, thank you so much and go Vols.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4480.0) |

|    4488 |  4489 | One question.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4488.0) |
|    4490 |  4495 | This is a work session, so next week is your actual council meeting, correct?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4490.0) |
|    4496 |  4497 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4496.0) |
|    4498 |  4500 | Should I be there for that? I'm happy to attend.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4498.0) |
|    4501 |  4506 | And then Chief Sneed was going to attend your session tonight, but then I gave him the pause.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4501.0) |
|    4507 |  4509 | But we could both be there next week.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4507.0) |
|    4510 |  4514 | I will be in touch, but if you could, that would be wonderful.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4510.0) |
|    4515 |  4517 | Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4515.0) |

|    4537 |  4541 | Commissioner Schoonmaker to hopefully answer your question regarding that item.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4537.0) |

|    4750 |  4751 | and we started talking about what it does,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4750.0) |
|    4752 |  4753 | the direction it could do.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4752.0) |

|    4761 |  4764 | What CPACER does is it allows banks                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4761.0) |
