| 0:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Well, thank everybody for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| This, I think, is an incredible opportunity for Council to learn about the efforts that this administration makes toward helping our homeless population and this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=86)|
| 0:01:39| We have worked on this situation for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| I know there are certain levels of frustration shared by some of us and certainly some in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| but I would like to ask Mayor Herro to start this workshop by making a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| First, I want to demonstrate to Council and the public our new accessible – well, we've had it for a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| but I don't think anyone's realized that we have an accessible podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| Pretty nice, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| So if you're in a wheelchair, you can come right underneath and lower it so it's convenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| or if you're short like I am, you can lower it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Makes you look tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Yeah, so it's – anyway, I've been waiting for someone to use this, so it had to be me, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| So thank you so much for having this workshop on homelessness and appreciate everybody who is here with us to join in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| You know, my administration, for the six-plus years that I've been mayor, has been committed to addressing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| We know it's the right thing to do, and we know if we're going to have any progress in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| it's not just the city, it's a whole community response, and you see a lot of these community partners here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| So many of you know, and I think Vice Mayor Saunders may have been alluding to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| that back in 2005, under Mayor Bill Haslam, the city adopted a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=176)|
| 0:03:05| and there was a focus on housing first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| You need to get folks into housing, which we still think is an important priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| And there were controversies related to that, but despite the controversy, what we believe, when we look back on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| it was really successful in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| When you look at Menvilla, as an example, and Flinican, and the developers of each of those are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| the nonprofits who developed those, those are wonderful examples of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| Together, over 100, I forget exactly how many total between the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| but over 100 individuals are getting permanent supportive housing and care, the services that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| Throughout that process, we started seeing greater cooperation among service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| and people kind of adopting what part of the, what role they would have in this bigger community response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| And HMIS started back then as a result of that as well, which we'll hear from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| So then, fast forward, when I came in in 2011, we developed and city council adopted Knoxville's plan to address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=250)|
| 0:04:21| It was four years ago this week, according to my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| And when I say we developed it, it's the people in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| We worked together, led by our Office on Homelessness with Mike Dunthorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| but together we put together that plan and each taken responsibilities for implementing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=272)|
| 0:04:41| We started the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| and many of these individuals here tonight meet quarterly with us to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| to make sure that we're coordinating with one another and to track our progress throughout in implementing the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| So the purpose of the Roundtable is to be intentional about convening the decision makers of our community's agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| and organizations that focus on homelessness in order to be accountable to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| to individuals and families in Knoxville who need help, and to the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| Also under my administration, we have committed not just federal pass-through dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| but local resources with council's approval on the budget items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| to help with things like case management for homelessness prevention and permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| development of affordable housing, and opening the new Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| It is important to understand, however, that while the city plays an important role in convening and coordination and in funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| ultimately it's not the city government's plan or the city government's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| It is and must be our community's response, and it takes all of us working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| And council's representative has been Vice Mayor Saunders on the Roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| I appreciate his commitment, and I know there's been a lot of discussion among council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| particularly our new council members, to get up to speed and understand exactly what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| So because of this community response and us working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Vice Mayor Saunders and Mike Dunthorne worked to structure the workshop, as you see in your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| Mike Dunthorne, who staffs our Office on Homelessness, does the day-to-day work of coordinating with community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| to implement the community's plan on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| So Mike will provide an overview of the plan and those efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| but then you all will hear from people who represent the Roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| which is made up of the community's organizations that do the difficult and challenging work of meeting the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| of so many people who are struggling and need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| There's an enormous amount of work that is being done every single day to address those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| Some of the organizations doing that work are listed on tonight's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| and will offer brief overviews of the work that they do to serve specific parts of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Along with them, there are many others who are in the room tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| and they are available to answer questions about their organization or their piece of this work as you go throughout the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=430)|
| 0:07:19| There is a lot of work already being done, and there are still many unmet needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| So we will try to shine a light on that this evening in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| As we go through the rest of the agenda, I'm going to ask Mike Dunthorne to really kind of introduce everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| But while our agenda indicates that questions are the last thing, in fact, as we go through this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| if you have questions, don't hesitate to interrupt me and let's address these things as they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Now, Michael, if you would tell us about the overview of the program, and then we'll go through the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| The mayor said I can adjust the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| I wanted to just start by expressing my gratitude to the people who are before me and came before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| and the others who were in the room and come after me on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| because I'm just the guy in the office on homelessness, and it's all these other folks that are so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| Vice Mayor, you've been there at Homeless Coalition meetings and Mayor's Roundtable meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| and so many other things and been involved, and I've spoken with each and every one of you on different occasions about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| And so it helps me in my job to know that you guys are interested and you care about this issue and you want accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=517)|
| 0:08:47| The mayor has provided the critical leadership to all this and the political will to be active up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| and addressing this issue, which is really distinctly unglamorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| It's not the issue that people run for office to want to be up front about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| but the mayor really has been very up front and committed and understanding and responding to the issue of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| She really does show up at things and play that important leadership role and really understands this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| So I really want to express my gratitude to you for that leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| The people who follow me on the agenda are the people who are going to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| and then there are folks who are just in the room here who are in the roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| or who are in service provider agencies that can be here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| These are the folks that do the real work, and there is so much work that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| Every time I interact with any one of these folks, I am just reminded of the high level of commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| that all of these folks have to serving people who are in need in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| and I think that's really important to understand their level of commitment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| So Knoxville's plan to address homelessness, which was adopted by city council four years ago this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| is based on one key central principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| and that idea is that homelessness is not an acceptable circumstance for anyone in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| and I think that ties it all together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| It's that idea that calls on us to be accountable to the people that we want to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| to each other as we work together, to the community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| as we consider the best use of resources to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| It also calls on the people who need the help to do their part within their own individual challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| and circumstances to be accountable to themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| and to a community that is actively stepping up and trying to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| The causes of homelessness are diverse, as are the people who are at risk or have experienced homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| Things that come up in the survey work that we do as reasons why people say that they have become homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| they've lost work, they have insufficient income, they can't find affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| their utilities are unaffordable, victims of domestic violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| people who have been evicted for one reason or another, substance abuse, mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| health problems, interaction with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| These are all reasons that contribute to the complex set of situations that can lead to someone becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| Different types of people who experience homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| It's both men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| It's youth and young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| It's families, and those families are made up of different characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Typical mom, dad, kids, single parents, same-sex parents, families, victims of domestic violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| people with behavioral health issues, military veterans, LGBT individuals, families, and youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| All those folks are part of the myriad of folks that we have to try to work to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| The plan itself that we're working with falls into five categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| and its format is basically aligned with the federal initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| and the state plan that was actually adopted after our local plan and the federal initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| The first point is simply provide leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| That means we have the mayor's roundtable that the mayor talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| We have in place the Homeless Coalition, which was actually created in 1986 and has met monthly since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| It has been a very active workhorse organization that has been here for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Gabe Klein is here, and she's the president of the Homeless Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| That organization is also responsible for HUD continuum of care funding with my help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| and that brings in about $1.3 million of HUD funding directly to the agencies that participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| It's also a means to do the workhorse figuring to develop the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| that are then brought forward to the mayor's roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| where we then ask the leadership to consider and make commitments to solutions to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| There's a new Youth Homelessness Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Sean Griffiths is the chair of that, and that's part of the Homeless Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| and that's going to be doing a lot of work over the coming year to develop a youth-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| That's kids under 18 and young adults, youth-specific plan to address homelessness through that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=810)|
| 0:13:41| The next point, oh, and also collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| Knox HMIS, you're going to hear from them, and that is absolutely critical to collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| Improve the crisis response system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| You're going to hear from Knox Area Rescue Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| You're going to hear about the new coordinated entry system that you voted on funding for recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| and then we also have the safe space thing under Broadway that we're working through the process for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=842)|
| 0:14:13| The next point is create and maintain access to a variety of decent, appropriate, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| That includes permanent supportive housing that we've referenced here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Volunteer Ministry Center, Knoxville Leadership Foundation, Positively Living, Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| all do permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| There's a new initiative over the last several years called Rapid Rehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| which is bringing folks who have become homeless back into housing as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| CAC, Volunteer Ministry Center, and the Salvation Army are involved in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| And then there's simply just creating and maintaining enough affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| and so we have the new affordable rental housing fund that the city has funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and already that's yielded 12 units with McNabb for veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| 12 units with Restoration House for single women with kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| and then 172 units about to break ground in South Knoxville of just simply affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| because without that folks don't have a place to live and to move to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| We want to increase economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Knoxville Leadership Foundation has a new, very innovative job training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| that they've been working with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Helen Ross McNabb Center manages a program called SOAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| that helps people who are eligible for disability benefits to get through that very difficult process very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=932)|
| 0:15:40| and with a much higher success rate than people typically receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And so if they're eligible for that and they can get that income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| that helps get them housing and get them what they need, and so that's critically important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| CARM has job training programs that are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| And even the Office on Sustainability's recent KEEM program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| and the Round It Up program that continues is something that interfaces with the homelessness plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| because at the beginning of that, that was partly because of discussions that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| with the Office on Sustainability of how do we address the issue of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| simply not being able to stay in their housing because of high utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| or not being able to get back into housing because they owe back high utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And so it's all those things that can work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| The final point in the plan is improve health and stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| Cherokee Health Systems has their center right there at Fifth and Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| that serves this population directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| There's dental services at Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Helen Ross McNabb has behavioral health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| and we also work with the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So you're going to hear more about those things in detail from various service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| and you'll hear from a whole list of folks that we have listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| I hope we'll make a few important points tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| Homelessness is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| It seems obvious, but there are no real simple, easy, clever solutions that just fix everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| There is an enormous amount of mostly unseen work being done in our community every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| to serve the needs of our neighbors who are at risk of or experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| And so it's really important that we see how much of that work is being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| because the important issue that we're dealing with presently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| what we see out on Broadway, is critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and we are trying to work through that process to improve that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| But that's just a small portion of what we're addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| So there's a lot of work going on, and I hope you'll hear all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| And then it's critical to understand that even with all of the work that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| there is more to be done, there are unmet needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and we will continue to have to look for additional resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| to provide assistance to the people that need help to not be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| I'll give a quick update on the Safe Space effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| We are finalizing a design for an outdoor daytime space in the Broadway area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| that will have security, water, and sanitary facilities, mobile phone chargers, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| It will be a low-barrier daytime space operated with security looking over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| to make sure that it's a place where people can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| And then I'm working with the purchasing department to get a project bid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| to get additional social workers who will be specifically doing outreach in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| to folks who are just simply resistant to services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| or have difficulty getting connected with services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| so we want to apply additional resources to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| The early diversion program to reach sex workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| is something that you all voted on very recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| and I think they're in the hiring phase to get started with that at Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| You voted recently out of those funds to get the coordinated entry system up and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| and that's already starting here with our friends from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| You'll hear a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And then finally, we're still trying to formulate an approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| to figure out how best to reach out to the faith-based community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| to help direct their interest and concern in the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| in ways that will collaborate with the folks that are behind me and work with us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| rather than more ad hoc impromptu things that are nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| but don't really necessarily lead to the long-term solutions that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| So I've kind of been through this very rapidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| and we'll have opportunities for questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| but up next we're going to hear from Lisa Higginbotham with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and Knox HMIS to look at numbers and statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Before we move on, I know the mayor's got to leave in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Oh, you're not going to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| I thought it was before 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I just wanted to make sure anybody that had a question might go ahead and ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| I do want to say the plan itself, the plan that we adopted four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| as I recall, and in reviewing it a week or two ago when you sent it to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| has a component in it that asks for more responsibility on the part of the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| I kind of want to talk about that a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Just kind of how that might be manifested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| Well, that's manifested in a lot of ways every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| and you'll hear more about that from the folks who work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| The idea of housing first, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| is you want to move somebody who's been even chronically homeless into housing as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| but really you can't even do that until that person has worked with a case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| to the point where they say, yeah, I'm ready to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I'm ready to make some kind of change in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| And so you can do all kinds of things to help people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| but until they step forward and say, yes, I need and want and will accept the help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| that's the kind of thing that you need out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Everybody has human personal dignity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| and everybody has to be as responsible as they are individually capable of being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| If you're somebody who's struggling with addiction or mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| that's going to complicate that quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| But the idea is simply structuring what we do to try to build accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| even with the folks that we're serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| and try and get them to step forward as much as they are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| and meet us halfway or partway or some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Can you give me an example of what you mean by accountability on their part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| I think the rescue mission can talk about some of the things that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| where if someone is staying at the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| and is capable of working on addressing their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| then they're going to check in with them and make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| hey, are you connecting with one of our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| or with a resource with another agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Because at some point, if you're just simply using a shelter to stay every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| and then do nothing and feed your addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| or do things that are counterproductive to the community and to the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| then maybe that's not the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| And so those kinds of things are built into what all of these folks are trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| because the whole point of all this is not just simply trying to hand things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| and give things away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| It's about trying to engage and help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| and get them to help themselves to the greatest extent they're able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| Mr. Dunthorne, first I wanted to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| because I know even before I was serving on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| you and I had talked about these issues and you were always available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| and I want to thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| And I want to extend that also to everyone that's here today that's working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| as you mentioned, very complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| One thing I wanted to ask you about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| and you mentioned a little bit in your opening remarks, the types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| And so we certainly have transitional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| which I think is maybe part of the rapid rehousing that you discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| and then permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| I wonder if you might want to just kind of expand on that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and then let us know if there's a preference towards one or the other right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| whether it's federally or state or here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| The federal preference is always going to be for permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and particularly things that they want to fund are going to be permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| Related to that is rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| That's another high-priority item to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| is, again, helping folks move into permanent housing as quickly as possible after they become homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| At least from the federal perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| they have looked askance at transitional housing for the last eight or ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| and I think that's because, at least in some circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| the outcomes were not being considered very well in transitional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| where you would put somebody into a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| but after six months or a year or two years or whatever that program was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| were those folks getting into a permanent situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Because ultimately you solve homelessness with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| There is utility to transitional housing for specific populations and to address specific needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| but the ideas around that are restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| So even, for instance, you've been on the board of the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| They've shifted a lot of their funding from HUD in transitional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| to a new transitional housing slash rapid rehousing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| which to my understanding is intended to use that transitional housing as a stopgap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1511)|
| 0:25:19| for somebody who was then working through the process to get back into housing quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| So really it's all about being intentional about using the resources that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| to get people back into permanent and stable and appropriate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| So I think there's a place for all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| There's even things that have been called safe haven or things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| for people who have very high needs even beyond what you might see at Menvilla or Flanagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| who need additional assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| There are folks who, because of their addiction or severe mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| need a higher level of service, and so that's been a gap in our portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| So there's a whole spectrum from all that to just simply affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| which we don't have enough of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| So what I'm hearing is I guess that there's, to address this, there's not one size fit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| One size does not fit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| There's the whole gamut, and we still need pretty much all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| And then the second point I wanted to ask you about was with regard to workforce development programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| Certainly with the premise that you started with about trying not just giving out a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1586)|
| 0:26:35| although of course there's a need for emergency situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| but actually giving folks training so that they can move on from this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1599)|
| 0:26:48| Can you maybe speak a little bit to, I know you mentioned, I think CARM has a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| and I'm sure we're going to hear from them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| but is there an emphasis as well on workforce training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| That is one issue that I am not the expert on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| but yes, we do want as much of that type of assistance as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| There are a lot of challenges, particularly in competitive work environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| of simply getting somebody who is at the point where they are literally homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| to be able to be considered by employers, whether it's because of their skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| because of their address that they have to give to say when they're filling out their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| And so we do have folks that are working on doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| and it's exceptionally challenging to help people find employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| The Salvation Army also obviously does that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| I just wanted to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I'm a little surprised to see that your number is at 34%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| for persons reporting a disability diagnosis of mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| So I want to ask you, when you mentioned the chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| how does that population correlate with your chronically mentally ill population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| HMIS is going to provide the real details and the numbers, and I always turn to them for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| but part of that is going to be self-reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| A lot of these numbers, when we look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| it's the person themselves saying that I have a mental illness or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| And so there are many who may have a mental illness to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| that are not going to report that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| And Lisa can correct me if I'm misleading you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Let's ask Ms. Higginbotham to come up and tell us about HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Good evening, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I am Lisa Higginbotham, and I serve as the program manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| for the Knoxville Homeless Management Information System, known as the Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I'm here today to give you a big picture of what homelessness looks like in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| You might pull that microphone down just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I'm going to share several reports and talk about a new community-wide collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| to make homelessness rare and brief in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| First, let me start by telling you more about what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Knox HMIS started in 2004 as the only HMIS affiliated with a university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| We were set up as such to offer a non-biased outcomes measurement and reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| And although we are affiliated with the university's College of Social Work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| we are funded through HUD, city, and county grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| and now have the equivalent of 2.5 staff working on this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| We support the work of now 19 partner agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| which includes over 60 programs serving persons experiencing homelessness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| Many of you here in this room know Knox HMIS as a database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| We are that and much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| The agencies represented here today are some of our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| Not only do we help them manage the data quality on persons that they serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| we help them better understand the impact and effectiveness of their efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| through regular reporting and on-site visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Recently, through the city's support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| we have moved beyond just internal reporting to agencies to public-facing outcomes reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| and have become a national model through our work on the Community Dashboard on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| So we have that up for you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| And if you look at the Community Dashboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| we have several quarterly counts at the top of those that are clients that we're actively serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| those at risk, those that are literally homeless, and new clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| And this is throughout the calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| and we update this quarterly and have discussions on this Community Dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| at the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| We also have some basic outcomes, such as positive housing placements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| return to homelessness, duration of homelessness, and housing stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| And if you'll scroll back up to Rapid Re-Housing and select Program Type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| you can hover over the different data points, and if you go over to Program Type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| you can also change to see how long people are staying in emergency shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| how long people are staying in transitional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| how long they're staying in permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Those are some of the outcomes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| This dashboard was designed with you all in our community in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| We wanted to make sure that this was public-facing to encourage transparency, accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| and most importantly, to foster open discussion and collaboration on solutions to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| You can click on the information icon for further explanations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| We tried to break down some of the terminology that you were talking about, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| And you can use the buttons to change the views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| We've also included at the bottom of some of the outcomes boxes HUD benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| as a starting point to gauge our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| The dashboard helps the conversation, and we can help as Knox HMIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| delve deeper into multiple factors related to homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| In front of you is a summary of our annual report for 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| This was compiled with agencies in mind to help them understand how folks are accessing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| and who is seeking services in order to advocate for improved support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| If you'll now turn to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| So in looking at the one sheet, last year in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| there were 8,938 individuals experiencing homelessness in Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| which is a 5% decrease from 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| And if you look at the graphic with the number of active persons in Knox HMIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| this gives a picture of 2007 through 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| And the reason we started with 2007 is that's when we began doing an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| 86% of active clients in 2017 were homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| 14% of those were housed and at risk of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| or stably housed and receiving supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Twenty-five, we get asked this a lot, what causes homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| There's so many different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Twenty-five percent of head of households report and self-report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| that they cannot find affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| The second half is really about those that are new to Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| In looking at our annual report data in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| I think that was our last Mayor's Roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| we had a really great discussion on why was there a 16% increase in persons new to Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2042)|
| 0:34:12| So we have the numbers in front of us a lot of times in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and it really takes conversations at the Mayor's Roundtable and with our partners at meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| to really understand the stories behind those numbers and to get a better picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| And again, that's fostering collaboration and conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Some potential factors that we identified in our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| was that as folks are exiting into permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| that may be making room for additional persons to be served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| that may be freeing up some dollars from rapid rehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| or from other types of programs that are helping these people get into services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| And also, some of our programs in the community have hired new staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| which has allowed them to go out and do more outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| and so those numbers have increased there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| And we've specifically noticed this with our youth homeless outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| through case management and also through street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Those numbers jumped up several hundred this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| If you'll turn on the back to the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| we did present for you all subpopulations of persons served here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| and we have family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Those are individuals within a family household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| When we say family, what we mean are households with children under the age of 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| seniors, that's age 62 plus, veterans, those having military experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| youth ages 12 to 24 that are unaccompanied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| and those that are experiencing chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| Councilwoman McKenzie, you asked about those reporting a disability diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| We believe that that number is low because that is self-report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| and we're not asking for a proof of, hey, can you show us your diagnosis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| So that is typically underreported in many communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Fifty-six percent of all persons reporting a disability diagnosis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| do not have health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and the reason I wanted to put that in there is to kind of show, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| they may not be able to get access to the services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I'm going to go ahead and say again, as Mike said, homelessness is complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and sometimes my job gets complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| such as learning how to make these graphs for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| and I can go ahead and tell you that that bottom graphic is not at all accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| I've worked on this so many times and had so many different versions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| so I will be sure to get you an updated graphic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| But it's still true that the persons in need exceed the potential beds dedicated to those populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| I think the only one that's somewhat accurate is family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| to show the kind of scale and scope there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| So I'll be sure to get those updated numbers for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| We know that there is intense work to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| and this work is not easy with limited housing and support resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Knox HMIS is now stepping into a new role to further facilitate agency collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| Again, through the city's support, we have been able to hire a coordinated entry facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| and I think that Knox HMIS was given that opportunity largely because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| we do serve as a leader in trying to foster those collaborations with all of the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2252)|
| 0:37:41| What this means is that a person will work more intensely with agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| to create real-time referral and a standard assessment system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| so people will not languish on the streets, again, making homelessness rare and brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| Chris is going to tell you more in just a few seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and I want to emphasize that coordinated entry is no small feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| I can't say that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And it will require the work of more than one person or one agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| It will require everyone in this room, all of the council, and all of the partners that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| It's a new way of doing our work, and all of us will need to come to the table again and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| ready to be creative and solution-focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So I can turn it over to Chris, who can tell you more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2308)|
| 0:38:37| Chris, I have failed to do a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| and that is to ask those who speak to tell us who they are and their address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| And you can raise the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| I'm going to try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Chris Smith, 600 Henley Street, Suite 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| And thanks, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Lisa mentioned two-and-a-half staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I don't know if I'm the other, if I'm a full body or half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I'm a full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Okay, so working with HMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Let me tell you a little bit about our coordinated entry and kind of what our efforts are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| So HUD has challenged each continuum of care to rethink homeless service provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| moving from an agency-level response to homelessness to a community-based response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| through a coordinated entry system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| For the past year, our community has taken that charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Our community's homeless service providers have been meeting to create a meaningful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| intentional system of care that can prioritize our community's most vulnerable individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| and families with the goal of maximizing our available housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| and linking those experiencing homelessness to the most appropriate resource or service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| My role is coordinated entry system facilitators to help stimulate that community discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| To aid agency administrators in developing coordinated entry policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| and to assist the implementation of this new way of offering care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| So we're calling our coordinated entry system CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| which stands for Coordinated Housing Assessment and Match Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| HUD has outlined that each coordinated entry system should have at a minimum standardized access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| standardized assessments, and standard referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| We have done or are in the process of doing all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| We have a public launch planned for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Next month we'll be launching CHAMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| So let me kind of take a step back and kind of show you when someone enters CHAMP, what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| So with CHAMP, when a literally homeless individual or family expresses a housing need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| they're ushered to a data access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| And so a data access point, those are for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| For single adults, they would go to VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| For veterans, they would go to VOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| And for families and youth, they would go to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| So those are our three data access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| At these access points, they're given an assessment, which is the VI-SPDAT, which sounds great, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| It's a vulnerability index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And this is an evidence-based tool that's been used throughout the country in coordinated entry systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2467)|
| 0:41:16| We've adopted something that's been used with success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| So the end result of this vulnerability index is a score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| And the vulnerability score is directly linked to a specific referral type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| so that those performing the assessment can direct the individual or family to the available community service or program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| that can accurately respond to the presented homeless situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| To those with the highest vulnerability, and this is where it gets cool, good, heads up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| a referral is made to a weekly by name case coordination meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| And this is a meeting where housing providers and case managers will convene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| and make decisions as to how we as a continuum of care will respond to Knoxville's most difficult homeless cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| This weekly meeting is a problem-solving meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| It's a meeting where families and individuals get keys to houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| So this isn't just a let's think about the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| This is a problem-solving meeting on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| So through the system, through CHAMP, we'll be tracking when a person or family has entered CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| where they were referred, the length of time it took to access services, if and when housing was achieved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| and whether or not there was a recidivism back into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| So we're capturing a lot of data as someone enters into the system and exits the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| And that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| So let me talk a little bit about the benefits of switching gears like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| The benefits for moving this coordinated response for clients are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| Moving into CHAMP is really streamlining services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Instead of an individual going from agency to agency, running into endless intakes, assessments, wait lists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| CHAMP provides one survey and connects to real-time housing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| CHAMP works towards eliminating the confusion clients are often confronted as they are referred from one program or service to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| As a uniform community response, all providers are using the same language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| preventing duplication of services and allowing a more humane delivery of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| For providers, CHAMP reduces the time spent screening clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| managing wait lists, and tracking down clients to fill available housing units or case management slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| It allows them more time to do the important work they were created and funded for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Instead of each agency doing it all, which is kind of how it's working now, each agency gets to now do what they do best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| Two, CHAMP promotes and supports collaborative relationships between homeless service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| Instead of a system where providers are seemingly in competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| CHAMP demands coordination and work toward a shared goal of making homelessness rare and brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| For administrators, CHAMP offers a chance to maximize existing funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| The goal of CHAMP is to make sure individuals or families appropriate for a program are referred to that program in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| CHAMP requires real-time, live coordination and collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| so it offers administrators the ability to receive current, real-time data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| and complete information that will aid them in service delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| It's a way to maximize existing funding and to reduce overall costs through decreased use of emergency services because of streamlined services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2670)|
| 0:44:39| I mentioned data, and I failed to mention this as we talk about the weekly case conferencing meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| and I didn't print this off for you, but as you see on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| this is some of the data that we'll be looking at on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| It includes their VI score, that's the score that's color-coded on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| but other ways that we're going to prioritize individuals to quickly get them into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| such as that next one is duration of homelessness, the duration of since they've done the VI-SPID Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2705)|
| 0:45:16| We're capturing a lot of information as we get around this road, so for administrators, it's invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| For the community as a whole, CHAMP allows us the opportunity to more accurately assess our homeless situation at a given point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| Using data created by CHAMP, we can see what within our system of services is working, what's not, and what's missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2728)|
| 0:45:37| We'll be able to more accurately determine how long an individual or family is struggling on the street or in shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| how our community is responding to those situations, and whether or not we're succeeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| CHAMP will allow us real-time data to approach funders and stakeholders to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| and most appropriately address the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| This data can undoubtedly be used by this group to inform budgetary decisions as we strive to end homelessness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| As was mentioned earlier, if the principle that we're accepting is that homelessness is unacceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| then that kind of principle really needs a community-driven response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| So if the idea is to move us from an agency-level response to a community-level response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| I think this is the direction that we should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| The good news is that we know this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| We're not the only community doing something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| There are others that we're using as best practice examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| I mentioned the VI-SPDAT as something that's been working for other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| So we know this works and we know this can work and will work for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| Again, we're starting a launch in May, so that's very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| Chris, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I do have a question, and I hope it's clear to my colleagues that I think I'm correct in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| A homeless person that presents him or herself to an agency can register wherever to get into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| That's correct, and we're using these data access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| These are largely where individuals would land anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| For families and for youth, a large amount of the services for those populations are at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| So we're saying that that's their data access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| For singles, VMC is doing a lot of those case management tasks for those adult singles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| and VOA, of course, for veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| But, yes, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Any agency would be able to perform this assessment and get them in the CHAMP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| So we have CHAMP and we have HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| They're two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| CHAMP and Lisa calls CHAMP HMIS 2.0, and I think that's an oversimplification, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2879)|
| 0:48:10| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I went to one of the homeless roundtables at KCDC sometime last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| and you guys were talking about you needed to get the system up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| It was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| You were going to lose funding, and it was going to be a very negative thing for our ability to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| if we didn't get it up, and somebody had to do the data entry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| and there was no funding to pay somebody to do it, and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| You were trying to problem solve and figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Is that what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| I'm so confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| It is a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| So NOCS HMIS is the designated homeless management information system for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| The CHAMP or coordinated entry is now part of residing in the same office space as NOCS HMIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2929)|
| 0:48:58| and I provide supervision to Chris, but that could be any other lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| That doesn't necessarily have to be housed with NOCS HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| I think it was decided that it was because we've traditionally done the data aspect of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| and the reporting for that and the facilitating of collaborations across partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| One thing that's important with CHAMP is to make sure that this is real-time data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| We have a data management system in place, so to enter information into CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| we're going into HMIS and we're inserting information within that system, so it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| Let me offer just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| The CHAMP, the coordinated entry system, is essentially a new front end on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| and it merges wait lists for organizations and uses, as he was talking about, a tool to prioritize people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| And so it's going to make it much more effective for people to get the referrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| and the data gets started at that point, but HMIS is still everything that it always was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| This is a new starting point for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| And by merging wait lists and so forth, it's going to do things like give us a much better understanding of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| at one time, what are the actual needs for different types of housing, to your question earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3013)|
| 0:50:22| because right now you've got each agency has its own wait list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| and there's indeterminate overlap of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| and so this brings us to a new level in putting a front end on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| In the past, all of the service providers were all entering into HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| They were all entering into HMIS, but they might have their own intake system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| specifically for their program and for doing referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| They all had their own front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| They had their own way of doing intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| I understand databases. That's my day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| So are they still entering into HMIS the old way, or no, they're only doing CHAMP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| They are not entering into HMIS the old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| This is a new way of entering in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| They can still do their agency's regular information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| but to get someone on a shared wait list, they have to go through a new process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and they have to use the standard assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| VMC can't use their own housing assessment and CAC theirs and Salvation Army theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| and whoever else in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| We all use that same standard assessment for vulnerability and for referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| So it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| It's a different way of entering in the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| and instead of agencies having their own wait list, it's all one shared wait list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| which is what you see up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| And they both still exist, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Okay, I think that's the part I'm mildly confused on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| but I'll let it go and let somebody else ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Well, and they both still do exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| because not everyone that participates in HMIS is a housing provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| So is CHAMP specific to housing providers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| That is, I think, the best way to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| So, Chris, the 91 that we see here, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| In what time frame were 91 clients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| So we started scoring, and again, the official launch is in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| We're using this month as really a trial period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| So we've done, I think we've trained around 40 individuals to do this VI-SPDAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| So what you're seeing is since middle March, those are the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| and largely those are individuals who are families who are existent within programs already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| So those are already active within programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| The official launch will be bringing anyone new to homelessness, anyone in programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| and bringing them to this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| But, again, this month we're kind of using this as a way to teach us our lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| Okay, kind of a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| A pilot, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Program, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Well, this is a very, you know, exciting tool that you're using, and I really like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| because it will take a coordinated effort to be able to service folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| My next question you probably don't have an answer to right now because this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| you're kind of, it's new in a pilot stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| but I was kind of wondering what the average turnaround time looked like to service someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| that was categorized as more of an emergency type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| So this is how we capture that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| No, we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| But this is how we capture that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| And that's why I think this real-time, as someone goes through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| capturing at every point why this is so valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| We'll figure out, you know, who's languishing in the streets, what we as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| what we're doing wrong or what we're failing at, and what we're doing well at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Mr. Smith, first off, this coordinated entry system seems really innovative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| and I know you're saying that it's not the first time it's being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| but it certainly seems innovative in the sense that you're coordinating everything in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| and you're taking those surveys out of being all over the place to something we can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3254)|
| 0:54:23| and have data to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| So I really think this is really very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| One thing I want to know about with that program is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| are we going to be looking at duplicate services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| and whether or not implementing this into this database will allow us to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| I know you mentioned it's ease of use for someone who's going in and asking for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| but is there also a way of addressing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| the next day they go somewhere else and ask for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| and the next day they're going somewhere else and asking for service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| One VI-SPDAT score per person, and that stays with them until they find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| So that prevents at least them from going from one agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| maybe getting a score that's a little low or, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| then going the next day to another agency and getting a different score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| Lisa, I don't know if you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Well, the second part of this, and we're working on the training for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| we will also be drilling down, and part of this discussion in the weekly meetings will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| okay, is this person that scores within the permanent supportive housing range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| do they have a case manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Who is their case manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Who's the one person that we can go to to follow up with this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| So in that way, it will address some of the duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| Now, a person can go wherever they want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| and they can go there as many times as they want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| and it will certainly help us all as workers be communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| on what's going on with that particular individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Does it also help point them to a particular provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| that may be best equipped to deal with their particular situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| Well, and that's what this is doing in many communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| is that it is a discussion whenever a referral is being made for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| the person is given a list of what their options are and what the availability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| You know, ideally, that's what they'll be given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| and a person can say, okay, that's not going to work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| And so there is some client-centered approach in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| And then some of the agencies may, during case conferencing, say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| we've had a situation with this person, it's really not going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| You know, so it's really a goodness of fit for that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| is what we'll be looking at through this weekly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| I think ultimately what we want to happen is that Program X will say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| you know, in terms of VI-SPDAT score, that that's our sweet spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| And number 7-8, that's our sweet spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| So send us those referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| And I think, you know, we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| We're not there yet, but we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| The other thing I wanted to ask you about is on the executive summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| the 25% number about cannot find affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| And I don't know if you can dig into this here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| but I was wondering if that 25%, do they have employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| Are they looking for employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Or are these folks who are employed who cannot find housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| and are therefore homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| And I can certainly look into that and see what we come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| Well, like I said, I wasn't expecting that you might not be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| That was digging in a little deep, so I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| The only other thing I was struck with from looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| and this is on the second page, the family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| And I do appreciate your graph work, so thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| No, no, no, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| You know, this makes it a lot easier to deal with something very complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| and looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| But family members was something I just don't know if you can expand upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| I think oftentimes when folks are thinking about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| they may not be thinking about families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| They're usually thinking about individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| And so I don't know if you have anything you can tell us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| whether there's an increase in families that you're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| whether there's particular services available for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| This may be something I may be getting ahead of myself a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| with some of the other providers that are going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| But that just struck me, and I thought I'd ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Well, I'm glad you recognize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| and I think that there are agencies here today that are prepared to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| so I certainly want to defer to them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| And I will point to I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| I think that a lot of people see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| what they see through their car window driving around town, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| and that's their idea of what homelessness is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| They don't recognize that it's families or seniors who are discharged from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| hospital onto the street or youth, you know, who are by themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| don't have their identification because their parent has thrown them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| You know, they don't see that there are multiple faces to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| So I appreciate you recognizing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| and I think that the other agencies are prepared to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| So we have in Item D here a list of providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| These are not all of the providers that we are working with by any stretch of the imagination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| but we tried to select a few to kind of give you overviews of their piece of this puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| as we work together on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| So up first is Steve Clabo, who works with Knox Area Rescue Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| Steve, when you come, if you would please give us your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Steve Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| I'm with Knox Area Rescue Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| My address is 418 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| And with me tonight is Todd Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Todd works more in our programs and operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| and I'm sure he'll be able to answer a lot more questions than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| But I just wanted to give you a little bit of information about the ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| Bert certainly, Bert Rosen, our CEO and president, sends his regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| Unfortunately, he couldn't be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| We've got our largest annual president's gathering that's going on right now in West Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3621)|
| 1:00:30| President Trump didn't come down there for that, but he was there earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and I'll be heading out there as soon as we get out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| But anyway, just a little bit, and a lot of you probably already know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| but Knox Area Rescue Ministry was established in 1960,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| and it was basically a union rescue mission for men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| And over the 50 years plus since that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| CARM has grown into a dramatically fashioned and established program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| that's designed to treat addiction, provide additional or educational assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| train people for successful employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| and help homeless men, women, and children rebuild their shattered lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| We have emergency services, and we'll always have emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| Our operating equation is rescue plus relationships equals restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| And through our staff and volunteers, we supply rescue services such as food and shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| and then offer a very healthy, supportive relationship to those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| And our ultimate goal, of course, is to end homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| and to restore those people back to themselves, their family, their community, and God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| Presently, we serve about 1,000 meals a day on an average to anyone in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| We shelter nearly 400 men on a nightly basis, 400 men, women, and children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| and that's 365 days a year. We don't close our doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| Our dining room currently seats about 200 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| and it's open every day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| We have five shelters that are within our walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| We have the Samaritan Hall, which is the men's overnight shelter that takes care of 200 men nightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| We have Hope Haven, which is the women's overnight shelter that has up to 100 beds per night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| And we have our Serenity Shelter, which is a women's long-term residential recovery program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Presently, we are doing an expansion of that shelter at its present location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3764)|
| 1:02:51| and we're going to have an opportunity to not only take care of women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| but we hope to be bringing our families into that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Some of our programs that we have now, one is our outreach in our NANUS Courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| which you'll see there next to our location on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| NANUS Courtyard actually offers a safe, welcoming outdoor shelter with restrooms, water, and other amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| and we have our outreach staff that works there on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| They're out in the courtyard talking to the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| and trying to discern the needs that those people have and to try to develop trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| That's one of our biggest challenges, to develop trust with those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| and then try to direct them to the appropriate resources that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| One of our big hits right now that's going on is a thing called City Nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| and City Nights is an outdoor opportunity that we have every Wednesday and Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| It more offers interaction and support and some engagement for those people that are on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| that won't come into our shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| The door is open, wide open. Anybody can come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| and we have our staff, our outreach staff, there every Wednesday and Sunday evening working with those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| and there's really been some truly magnificent work that's been done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| just in the short period that we've had that program going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Crossroads is our welcome center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Crossroads is our open door that is the starting point for helping someone initiate a change in their homeless situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3869)|
| 1:04:38| All the new guests are interviewed, and they understand so that we can understand the current emergency needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| and then get counseled in appropriate areas that they need that we have resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| that there's resources in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| If they're not within our walls, they're in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Crossroads connects more than 15 area agencies into a strong support network for the homeless guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3897)|
| 1:05:06| Once a guest comes in, they have opportunity to go into our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| One of the programs is called LaunchPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| LaunchPoint is a four-week program that's designed to help the homeless men and women begin a new life journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| It's the entryway to participate into our newest program, which is called Berea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| and I'll tell you a little bit about that here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| But LaunchPoint is one thing that we've had that going on now a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| and like I say, it's a four-week program where they can learn life skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| They can learn just simple things that you would take for granted on an everyday basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| However, if the individual, once they go through the LaunchPoint program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| they have an opportunity to go into our newest program called Berea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| and Berea is an unprecedented personal development opportunity that CARM is focused on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| and it focuses on work, learn, and serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| The objective of Berea is to prepare students for the abundant life that God has planned for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| and to provide a strong biblical foundation to build a life upon after CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| It allows restoration and a successful restoration for them to come back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| It is a six- to nine-month program, and we feel that most individuals have something to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3981)|
| 1:06:31| and if they give into what they're trying to do, they're going to grasp it more quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| and they're going to understand that it's not just handed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| That's why we do the work, learn, serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Once they're in the Berea program, we ask them that we're giving them something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| We want them to give something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| So they give something back to CARM itself, and they're able to work within the walls of CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| They're able to learn some type of trade, whether it's janitorial, whether it's food service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| whether it's landscaping, lawn care, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| They're able to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Then we want them to spend hours in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| That's the service part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| And we have those individuals, once they get to a certain point in our Berea program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| we ask them to spend 30 to 60 hours in community work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| And then, of course, the learning part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| It is a 12-week program that has certain courses they have to take, and then there's others that are electives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4042)|
| 1:07:31| One of the opportunities that we have, one of several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| but the one that I'd like to tell you about is our Abundant Life Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| Berea students, they may choose to enter the 12-week program of Abundant Life Kitchen food service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| It's a training program that provides 360 hours of classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| and its hands-on service instruction includes completion of a Serve Safe certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| So they actually get a certification that they've been through the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| and that's something that some of these people in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| in our restaurants, in our fast food services or whatever, they're looking for those type of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Students also participate in a comprehensive program called Jobs for Life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| And this program is where the topics include time management, resume writing, job search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| interviewing techniques, effective workplace communication, and just developing a strong work ethic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| The other program that we have that has the same type of classroom opportunities, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| is called our Clean Start program, and that is where they learn how to do janitorial service or housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4116)|
| 1:08:44| Then I will mention the Serenity Shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| The Serenity Shelter is our long-time residential recovery program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| and it offers crisis intervention and helps give recovery training, life skill classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| and individual group counseling, and it's also community-based mentoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| That is about a 12-month to 18-month program, and that is for our women only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4144)|
| 1:09:11| I'm sure you've seen all our Karm stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| We've got 18 thrift stores now that are out there to serve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| and it's amazing what the thrift stores are doing now to help support the ministry there on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| Just a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| I asked Todd this morning to give me some numbers that I might be able to give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| and I know Lisa put up a number about 34% of the self-reported mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4179)|
| 1:09:48| Our numbers mirror that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| We have 32% that self-report mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| We've got 24% that self-report physical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| and about 18% self-report a chemical dependence, whether it's alcohol, drugs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| Some of those have multiple issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| They could have a mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| They could have a chemical issue, or they could have a physical issue, and we see that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| We see that the people come in not with just one issue but several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| and so we're working on developing responses for those issues, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| Just real quickly, I wanted to touch on something that maybe I may try to touch on it before you ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4233)|
| 1:10:45| I was asked, what about people, are they kicked out of Karm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| There's only less than 1% ever since 2004, since we started the HMIS data input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4252)|
| 1:11:03| There's less than 1% today that have been asked to leave Karm and are no longer welcome there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| and those are individuals that have violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| and that violence could have some type of harm to any staff or guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| Out of the 25,000, close to 25,000 enrollment that we've had since 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| there's only about 128 today that are not welcome at Karm, and it's because of the violence issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| So everybody else is welcome at Karm, and we don't ask people to leave unless it's a violent issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| I'd be glad to answer any questions at this time if there's anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| We've got a long way to go, but one of the complaints that we get a lot is the situation on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| It seems to have gotten a lot worse the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| Someone, I'm not sure where exactly I heard it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| but it was that a lot of these individuals under the bridge and along Broadway either don't want to go to Karm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| or, you just talked about, were not permitted, or that they use Karm services some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| but they don't want to sleep there, and so that's really sort of why that problem is located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| Could you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| Do these individuals, are there individuals that don't want to go into Karm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| and what would be the reasons for that, and are there individuals there that sort of use Karm sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| but then just sort of hang out under the bridge area when they're not using the services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| Yeah, let me ask Todd to come up and let him explain to you about our intake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| and what opportunities those individuals have once they come into Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| Yeah, Todd, please give us your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| Todd Gilbert, 5708 Grasswalk Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| You're certainly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| There's a lot of individuals out there underneath the bridge who do not want to sleep at Karm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| and most of those issues result due to mental health issues or anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| We recently did a survey, and we talked to some people under the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| and I heard often that they went and had a service, they slept in there one night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| and due to their mental health, their anxiety just was very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| Sleeping in there were 202 other men, men they did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| A lot of our men and women have experienced severe amount of trauma and abuse at a young age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| extremely young age, and as they've grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| And so sometimes going into the showers area can trigger some of the mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| and as I said, sleeping in an open dorm style with 202 beds in the men's area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| and 103 beds in the women's area can trigger some of those mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| They would prefer they feel more safe, more at ease, less stressful out there under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| Some have even said that they're afraid it's going to trigger anxiety to the point of a violent outburst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| and they don't want to get in trouble with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| and so they're afraid if they sleep out in those dorms that a violent outburst would occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| and therefore trouble would come their way, and so they feel safer out there under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| That is a real issue that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| I would encourage my colleagues, if you haven't been to CARM, to the facility itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| to make an appointment, talk to Todd or Steve or Bert, and go over there and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| They're glad to show you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| It's really an incredible facility, but please make that available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| Vice Mayor, may I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| This may be more from Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| More to Councilman Stair's point, what is improvements that have been made about the sidewalk safety issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4491)|
| 1:15:01| I've heard from a lot of people and have witnessed it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| It's scary sometimes driving through there because you're afraid someone's going to spill out into the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| I don't know what the legal limitations on what we can do with people's rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| but that's just an issue that has gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| How do we not sweep the problem under the rug and push it off to some side street with all the services there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| I think we're going to have a lot of problems trying to get—I don't want to say anything, put anybody down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4530)|
| 1:15:40| but average citizens walking through that area, because a lot of people will just avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| I'm just curious, what gains have been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Well, obviously we're dealing with a significant challenge there in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| What I mentioned in the opening was we have designed for—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4556)|
| 1:16:05| Mike, back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| We've got to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| If you hit the black button, it stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Oh, I leaned on the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| We have a design for the safe space under the bridge that would be a daytime facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| and having that there and having the existing outdoor space during the day at CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4581)|
| 1:16:29| once we have that open, that gives the police more leeway within individual rights to tell people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| you can't be on the sidewalk here, but you can go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| There are—Captain Jones can probably speak to this a little bit when he steps up in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| but there are legal challenges for them to be able to tell somebody that's on the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| you can't be here if there is not someplace that they also can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| So hopefully when we get that safe space constructed and open later this year, that that will help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| But it's a tough circumstance, and we're not alone in this community with dealing with that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| and so I'm hoping that will bend the curve and make the situation at least somewhat better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| But we certainly are well aware that it's a pressing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Let me add to Vice Mayor Saunders' invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| We would love for anyone, all of you as a group, to come down, have lunch with us, let us show you the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| walk you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| You would need to spend a couple hours with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Don't come down and expect to see it in 10 or 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| We've got close to 100,000 square feet there that I think that you would be amazed at what we do have there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| and would love to share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| All righty, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Up next we have Volunteer Ministry Center, and I think I saw Bruce Spangler come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4678)|
| 1:18:15| We'll see how long we last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Well, I'll see how many more I can run off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Bruce Spangler, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| I'm the CEO of the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| I appreciate this opportunity to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| But most importantly, I want to hear some of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| But before I ask for your questions, I want to talk about two major programs that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| our Resource Center, which is a transitional day opportunity for folks who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| And I'd like to preface that by saying that we do not work with homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| We work with people who are experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| because all of us are more than just the sum of one experience in our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| And we do that intentionally because to respect the full dignity of that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| So in the Resource Center, for someone who's experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| they are assigned a case manager to help them navigate the housing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| to find housing as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| We operate on a housing first philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| How can Joe, how can Sally achieve housing as quickly as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| And then we wrap around coordinated services to help them sustain housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| It's a proven best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| It's evidence-based, and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| And one of the ways in which we have shown that to work is at Menvella Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| the old Fifth Avenue Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| We have 57 units there for folks who were formerly chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| Fifty-seven units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| And if my memory is correct, 48 to 50 percent of the present residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| moved in when we first opened in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| So with eight years, we have proven that permanent supportive housing works in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| and it works for the lives of those who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| And in some ways, I like to say that we at Voluntary Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| we have put $12 million in terms of investment in that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| But most of all, we've made an investment in the lives of our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| that's making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Ninety percent of the residents at Menvella Manor have been there for a year or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| So once you provide a stable place for someone to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| their ability to not only sustain housing but to deal with life issues is really, really enhanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| We think of housing not as a reward, but we think of housing as a tool for recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| In essence, you are not helping someone who's experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| until housing is part of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Housing must be part of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| And if I would expand that equation, you're not really empowering someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| who's experiencing homelessness until housing plus services is the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| What I value about tonight is that as all of my peers that were introduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4876)|
| 1:21:26| indeed they are pearls, if I may say, in terms of the way in which we're responding homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4886)|
| 1:21:34| But what we need in our community is the thread that holds us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| Benevolence alone cannot solve homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| It's not until we have a public policy can you truly deal with the issue of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| Well, I'll get off my stand, and I'd like to hear some of the questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| Well, I guess is that public policy missing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| I think it's being formulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| I think that with the 10-year plan that was started was a start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| and now with the city's response to homelessness that was adopted, what, four years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| Has it been that long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| It is another step, but we're beginning to put the steps in that infrastructure to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4938)|
| 1:22:26| Homelessness is not a VMC issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Homelessness is not a CARM issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Homelessness is not a CAC issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| And I can go on down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Homelessness is a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| And once we begin to respond as a community, and I think that we're building the infrastructure for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| and that's what I mean by public policy, council members there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| that that's what's happening in my community that I'm proud to be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| I do want to point out that the housing that you all provide is extremely important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| and the housing that is provided at Flinnegan is also important, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| But there's also housing that's provided by KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| And we work a lot with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| So it's not just those two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| I hope everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| And we could not do Menville Manor without KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| We have project-based housing vouchers there to make it affordable for our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| The council has met with Ben Bentley at KCDC that explained this, and I'm sure you all recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| And I think Ben may be right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| So if we have a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Mr. Spangler, you mentioned Menville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| And if I remember correctly from your statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| you had said that about 50% of the folks that moved in at the beginning of that are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| The approximate 50% or 40% that have left, can you maybe tell us a little bit about where they've gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| Are these folks that have kind of graduated from some of the services that you're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| and then moved on because they don't need the housing anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Or what are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| A small number of them have moved on to other housing that, how can I put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| when they are tired of us knowing their business, they move on to more I'll call traditional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| because you are working with a case manager there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| We've had some of our residents to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| A small portion have returned to the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| because it is true that for some individuals it takes several attempts to overcome the experience of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| especially with prevailing behavioral health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| We've had some folks who have gone back with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| But we probably have a turnaround of about maybe four units per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| So it's a very, very stable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| And then just with regard to the supportive part of that permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| we talked about a little bit earlier workforce development, workforce training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| Is that something you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| And then a follow-up on that is just what I had asked Mr. Dunthorne earlier was just about families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| And are you seeing an increase in families as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| We see an increase in families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| I'm going to work backwards on your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| We see mostly our families in our Bush Family Refuge, which we are helping with rent and utility assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| CAC, we normally refer our families to CAC or to Family Promise because they have the tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| they have the resources to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Most of our clientele, if I may, are individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Relative to income, the vast majority, to live at Menvilla, a chronically homeless individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| is actually a protected class because by virtue of the definition of chronically homeless presupposes a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5157)|
| 1:26:06| So we have some of our residents who work part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| The vast majority are qualified for SSI, which means that they draw the Social Security insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| They never work because they never had the capability of working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| And just the last thing I want to say, Mr. Spangler, is I really appreciated the way you described homelessness as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5182)|
| 1:26:32| all of us are more than the sum of one experience that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| And I just really appreciated the way you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| I thought that was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| To me and I think certainly to all of the folks that are engaged in this struggle, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| everyone I think is looking at each individual as having value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Everyone has a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| And so I think I just wanted to make that comment that I thought that was a great way of describing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Thank you, Mr. Spangler, for being here and sharing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| So for your residents that have mental health diagnosis, is part of the case management process medication management as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5230)|
| 1:27:20| Yes, but we do not dispense meds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| We are not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| However, for those who require that level of medication, we connect them with local mental health providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5243)|
| 1:27:32| Helen Ross McNabb, even in Cherokee health systems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| However, we are audited every quarter by KCDC in terms of the services that we are either providing or either we're referring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5258)|
| 1:27:48| So we have to give account of how many referrals we're doing for mental health or behavioral health, addiction disorders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| vocational rehab, or we also refer folks to the urban ministry for employment training as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| But we're audited once a quarter for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| And then you mentioned the resource center and the day program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Is that day program specifically for your residents or can other people that are experiencing homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| It is designed for folks who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| They are with us from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. six days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| We're not open on Saturdays for that program because our case managers can only really empower someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5307)|
| 1:28:35| while services are available Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| But for someone who's experiencing homelessness, so if I may, Council Member McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| say that you're a member of the resource center so you're just not walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| In essence, you raise that proverbial hand and say, I need something different in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| We understand that difference to start with housing and then we're connecting with the case manager of work or housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5337)|
| 1:29:04| So you just can't walk in and join the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| But we also know not everybody can raise that hand, and so we're working with other providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| and we do a little outreach to help folks who cannot access us in a mainstream way to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5353)|
| 1:29:20| But it is designed for someone who is homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| We have, what, maybe 100 to 125 on our roster at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| The average wait for those in our resource center to achieve housing in 2017 was between 11 and 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5372)|
| 1:29:43| That's the reason is the lack of affordable, accessible, and appropriate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5383)|
| 1:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| So I kind of have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Let's see if I can keep us going and quickly ask my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| So when you refer to a public policy that's needed to kind of be an overarching, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| guidance to make sure that we address things as we should, do you feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| or would you elaborate on whether you feel like that's just a local city issue or what role the state and federal play in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| I'm funding things through HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| I guess what I'm driving at is on a local level we hear a lot of folks say the city needs to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| and the city needs to do that and the city needs to fix that issue, that problem, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| But we're very limited, and I feel that some of the things are out of our control, not just financially but health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5441)|
| 1:30:51| The city doesn't have the capacity to be able to deal with all the health care that's lacking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| even if we made a policy to say that we were going to address that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| So elaborate, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| I am a preacher by trade, so I don't deal with answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| I just deal with the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| And I'm not a public policy wonk, so I can't tell you the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| But I guess what I'm trying to say is that when there's a community level response, that's what I mean by public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5475)|
| 1:31:25| And that's what you're doing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| I mean, you're educating yourselves on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| But also you have already put into practice a variety of things that make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| When you accepted the plan, if I may put it this way, you said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| well, you weren't a member at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| This body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| But this is our problem, and that had not been said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5507)|
| 1:31:54| That had not been said before by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| And I think that's a powerful, powerful statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| And so you're building upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| I wish I could fill in all the blanks and give me some time, and I will, Councilman Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| And then the other thing is, so Menvilla has been open since about 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| And so there are residents that have been there for the full eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Is there a goal in place for some of those folks to move on to more traditional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| or other housing opportunities to open up those units for other people that are on the wait list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| If they identify so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| If not, it's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Thus it is permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| Thank you, Mr. Spicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| Okay, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| We'll try and keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| With Knoxville Leadership Foundation, we have David Ault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| David, once again, if you would give us your name and your address, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| David Ault, 9957 Tierra Verde, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| So I want to echo Bruce and kind of just don't you love his passion about what the providers of homelessness do for us each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| And all of us that stand up here today, we're backed up by literally hundreds of case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| and service providers that are very passionate about what they do each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| So I hope I can represent that spirit that Bruce just talked about a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Flinnican Landing opened in November of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| So we're their provider, service provider of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| And we honestly did not know what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| So I just want to start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| And I think back to, I was talking to Captain Jones a little bit about the idea of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| can you imagine what the council looked like back in that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| These rooms were filled with people really not a little upset about building permanent supportive housing in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| which is where we're located today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| There was a hall full of people that were concerned about prostitution and drug use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and what's that going to do to my children and my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| So we literally, with the help of this council, with community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| we walked door to door through the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| We held community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| And we proved, as Bruce just said, permanent supporting housing does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| So Flinnican Landing has been around since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| The first year we were in operation, we called it the leavers and stayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| That's what HMIS calls it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| The folks that were leaving far outweighed those staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| So we had about a three-month window that we were keeping people at Flinnican Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| You skip forward to today with the work of everything that people just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| dealing with trauma, dealing with mental health, dealing with addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Our average stayers now are over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| And we do have people that have remained there the entire time, as Bruce has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| They're the mayor of Flinnican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| That's what we call him, affectionately call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| So one of those, I like to put a face on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| So I can speak about this individual and their deceased, but many of you knew Ms. Edna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| And this council and the mayor and community development and Captain Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| and all the police department knew Ms. Edna because she was the prominent bag lady in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| She literally carried her bags with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| And the police did a great job in their care and concern for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| But she could not be stable housed for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| She was homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| She spent her final three years of her life permanently supportive housed at Flinnican Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| And that's a great testimony to the power of what a council, a mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| a community development can do with permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| We're very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Come by and see Flinnican Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| The folks that we're worried about today are proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| South Knoxville is proud of Flinnican Landing, what it looks like, what it does each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| One other story I want to say, I'll use his nickname, is Razorback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| He doesn't really look like a Razorback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| He's a pretty unique individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| He came to Flinnican Landing when he was 21 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| And he's been housed there three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| So what can you do in three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| You can house somebody that the perennial bag lady of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| can have a permanent supportive place to stay and live out her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| Then we can take a 21-year-old that in three years dealt with his addictive issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| dealt with his trauma, became mentors to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| watched him get a little job as a security officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| watched him move up in income, watched him get a girlfriend, get engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| get married, and move out of Flinnican Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Pretty amazing story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| And that's really the only other piece I wanted to present to the council today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| that we've got a huge need, as Bruce said, to continue to work on this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| There's more need for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| There's more need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| There's also a need for workforce development and opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| So I hadn't really thought about talking about this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| but since, Councilman, you brought up many questions about workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| Knoxville Leadership Foundation about four years ago started working with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| The city council voted to support us in doing some workforce development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| with young adults, age 16 to 24, who were either out of high school, aged out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| or were not involved in any kind of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| So we started doing workforce training in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| My heart is pretty broken tonight about the number of homeless youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| that we've encountered in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| We have 26 students that we're serving today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| and we're teaching workforce development training at our facility on Elm Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| Out of that, four of them were referred to us as homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| They don't access our normal point of entry at CARM or VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| Those facilities don't always fit our young adults that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| What I found through working with Sean Griffith and Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| and Cherokee and lots of outreach workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| homeless youth is a growing problem and a need that this council needs to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| So we started out working with the idea could we teach young adults jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| and we learned how many of them are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| We learned how many of them are even more so in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| that they really shouldn't be housing-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| meaning living in a place couch homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| or bouncing around almost in a trafficked manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| to where the services they perform for them in exchange for a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| They're not even captured on our point of time count in HMIS, the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| Lisa did a great job in talking about the point of time count for homeless youth is growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| but it's a fraction of the need we have in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| and it breaks my heart what's going on with these young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| And so jobs matter, and we want to work with them in jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| but we first got to address their trauma, their addictive health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| and get them a safe place to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| And that's going to take a huge community effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| So that's what I want to talk about from Knoxville leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| because what we see at Flinnican Landing and I believe at Menvilla and CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| probably our average age is roughly 40 to 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Folks have been chronically homeless, homeless on the streets for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| But for most of their stories, it started when they were 16, 17, 18 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| and they were traumatized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| And if we don't address that issue at the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| we're going to be dealing with a much larger issue when they become 40 and 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Yeah. Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Anybody have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Moving through as quick as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| we've got Captain Don Jones from the Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| just to give a little reference framework on how they work with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5971)|
| 1:39:40| I think many of us know Captain Jones, but nevertheless, if you would identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| Captain Don Jones, 800 East Howard Becker Jr. Avenue is where I came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| right before I came over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| They give you a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| I've been with the Police Department for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| I've lived in Safini my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| I can tell this panel here tonight that in the last four years we've done more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| probably in the last four to six years we've done more to address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| It's what everybody's come up here and told you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| It's not one group or another that's going to have to take ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| The community has to take ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| Maybe the policy or the plan that they're talking about is it has to be a unified plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| That's been described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| When I first started in policing, we just drove up, picked them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| and we took them to the Salvation Army, which was on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| We just got them out of the car, walked them in there, and they just laid down on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| Some nights we would have a couple hundred, 300 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| stacked up in there on the lobby floor in the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| No services, no trying to move them, and things have gotten a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| We have trained ourselves at the Police Department to look for these issues over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| because we're with them 24 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| We're with them in the camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| We find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| We have to move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| We get complaints from neighbors and neighborhoods wanting to get them moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| and we have to work with Mr. Dunthorne and his group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| and all the other service providers in here to try to route the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| Our numbers come out about the same as the people we encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Probably about somewhere in the low 30% of them are reporting to us mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| Another 20% talk about chemical dependency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| So roughly 50% of the people either have mental health issues or alcohol issues, drug issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6112)|
| 1:42:01| or they're dual diagnosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| It's hard for them to function like normal folks that you would call normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| Of course, I've done this for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| I can't describe normal to you anymore from some of the stuff that I've run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| So I think that with the groups working together with the Mayor's roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| and the other groups that work together with the new BHUC we just opened to try to divert people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| one of the things that we saw from our vantage point is when we were just putting people in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| for different charges over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| That's basically what we did for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| We just put them in jail for either being drunk or disorderly or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| if we couldn't find someplace to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Those charges built up over time, and they couldn't qualify for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6169)|
| 1:42:56| So we were probably pushing the problem farther than it could have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| just based on the way we were addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| We had to educate ourselves as law enforcement to work within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| and with everybody to come up with a concerted effort to try to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| I think the plans that have been put in place over the last four to six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| have started making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| Ms. Edna that they brought up, Ms. Edna sat around uptown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| and if you were to spend any kind of time uptown, you've seen Ms. Edna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| She would sit on a park bench somewhere with 15 big bags around her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| and she would sit out at 14-degree weather all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| Very intelligent, bright woman, artistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| And you could have long conversations with her, but she did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| She had a real problem with trust, and she didn't trust people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| If you made acquaintance with her and could stop and talk to her, you could check on her, and she was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| She never did anything illegal, and folks would bring her things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| One of the things we struggle with are folks that want to come and help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| Mr. Dunthorne mentioned this about how we can work with our faith-based communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| to get them involved in this as well in a coordinated effort to bring people help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| not just handouts, but help up, maybe help them with job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| Maybe get some of the larger churches to put together something where they can do job training for folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| life skill training, things like that, to try to make it a community-based effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| So maybe that's the next step we look forward to is, with your help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| making a community-wide effort where you make contact with all the folks that you have influence over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| and bring them together and say, this is the help we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| The service providers in here, the city needs your help to try to get over this hump and solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6293)|
| 1:45:03| One of the big issues I remember when we were trying to put Flinnegan up, and he described that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| It wasn't pretty when everybody said, well, you can't build that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| It's going to destroy our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| There's a lot of that still out there that we'll have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| But housing is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| Housing and case management, you look at any model all the way across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| and I've looked at a lot of them, housing and case management are the only ways that you make real inroads in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| That's how we've made a lot of inroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| With the council's help, we're getting ready to add some more people to help do that, to try to speed that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6335)|
| 1:45:43| But we've got to convince folks to reach out and help us with housing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| So there's other parts of the community we could reach out to get that from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| Thank you, Captain Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| I do want to ask one question, and that has to do with the crisis intervention training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| that I know the police department has instituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| Have we noticed a better approach and treatment of the homeless, the panhandlers, the whatever with that training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6362)|
| 1:46:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| We identify the issues that they may have better than we did when I first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| We didn't have any kind of training like that when I started in policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| But our officers now, the younger folks that are out here and even the older ones that have been there a while, like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| have received some excellent training from Helen Ross McNabb and other professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| to help us identify people that are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| And we try to divert them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| That's one of the reasons the Behavioral Health Center was opened up about a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| was to give us an avenue to divert people away from jail, to stop that cycle of going to jail, getting out, going back, getting back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| and then not being able to accomplish anything and get you out of the cycle of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| Counsel, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Captain Jones, first, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| And then I just want to ask you, we've learned a little bit tonight about this growing need, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6427)|
| 1:47:14| just in the last presentation about youth and with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| Are you finding that you're encountering more folks that are in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| that would fall into one of those two categories where you're seeing more families and more youth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6445)|
| 1:47:33| The ones that we regularly encounter, the families tend to go to services more than the folks that are single do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6453)|
| 1:47:43| We run into a lot more in our world of the folks that are single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| and maybe the youth that we run into are folks that have been reported missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| and then we can get them back to their families if they've been reported missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| But if we don't find their families, then we have to go through DCS to deal with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| because of the legal issues that we're tied in with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| But in general, the folks we're dealing with basically run in age from early 20s to early 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6490)|
| 1:48:21| probably over 50, 60% of the people we deal with are in that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| I will tell you, I think many of you know Officer Clinton who works with Captain Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| and does an awful lot of that front-end work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| If you go to the Homeless Coalition or to the Homeless Roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| you will see both Captain Jones and often Officer Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| Next up we have Volunteers of America with Clyde Vincent of Veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| Sorry to keep wearing you out, but this is a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Well, this is, I think, an incredible opportunity for us to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| I mean, the resources obviously are available if we know what they are and help avail ourselves of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6546)|
| 1:49:15| Well, good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| My name is Clyde Vincent, and it depends if you want my home address or work address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| Either one will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| Either one. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| Well, my work address is 511 North Broadway in the VMC building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| and my home address is Tazewell, Tennessee, up the road a ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| But basically I just got to do a quick brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| and if you have any questions about how we, Volunteers of America Mid-States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| is assisting the city and the county with the homeless veteran population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| Basically we have two grants that cover Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| One is for housing, supportive services for veterans and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| and the other one is called the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| which is actually an employment grant, and that covers also Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| Basically, if you have any questions, there's all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| Housing program is sponsored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| That grant is through the VA, so we have VA rules that we have to follow on that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| and our employment grant is through the Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| And we've been doing that for a while in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| I've been doing this for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| And Mr. Premichet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| I do have one observation, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Lisa, I don't know whether you said this graph is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| but as I recall housing for veterans is reasonably successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| maybe more successful than some of the other housing needs we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| Can that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| I mean, the graph indicates that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| and that's kind of been my experience at least as I've been involved in the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| Do you want to make a comment about that, Lisa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| Again, it is one of those situations where there are units that are dedicated for veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| but the need continues to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| We are working with Volunteers of America to address the problem of veteran homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| and in the next year we hope to bring on the Veterans Administration into the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| They've recently been mandated to participate in their communities with coordinated entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| and also with HMIS, again, to verify those veteran statuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| and to see where they are in accessing benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| So that will help greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Well, we do have, just to answer a little bit on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| we have a good success rate on finding housing for veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| but we are also running into the same problem just as everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| is there's not enough housing for veterans, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| because we can only pay for housing for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| It's like a step-up type thing where we get the veterans on their feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| so they can take over and take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| So there is still that problem of affordable housing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| It's kind of an overarching situation, so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Councilwoman McKenzie, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you, Mr. Vinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I wanted to ask you about the reentry job program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| On average, how many veterans do you have in your program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| and how long is the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| Is it a structured program with a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| Okay, as far as the work program for the Knox County area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6762)|
| 1:52:49| well, for this grant, we have to have for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| I'm trying to think off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| I think it's about 125 veterans altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| And part of the thing with this grant is that it's a short-term grant, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| where we can provide some basic training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| but because it's Department of Labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| the biggest push for that is that basically when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| they have to be more or less ready to get a job as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| We refer a lot to the American Job Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| and anybody else around that we can find that's willing to provide training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| or apprenticeships, but unfortunately it's not a long-term program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6816)|
| 1:53:47| if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| So when a veteran signs up for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| how long are they in that program that's provided by the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| Okay, we have to follow them for 280 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| And that's about as much as we can do right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| This may be a question for Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| So I'm looking at all the handouts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| The HMIS system, number of active persons in Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| So when I look at the sheet here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| the total number of individuals that accessed homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| So that's 8,938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| That's just the number of people that tapped into services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| That's not necessarily the number of homeless people who are in homelessness at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6888)|
| 1:54:56| How many homeless are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Because there's potentially more than this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| That is for the entire calendar year of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| That's not what may be happening tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| And there could be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| because those are only the ones that are accessing our now 19 partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| And so when I flip it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| there's subpopulations of persons served by Knox County, Tennessee, homelessness service agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| but the numbers are much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| They're the subpopulations of that 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| No, my question was how many of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| what's the percentage of folks that are homeless that are veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| And based on this chart, 9% are veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| And that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| It's the bottom one that is totally not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| Ignore the bottom, and the top is 9% are veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| I'm surprised that is as small as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| Mr. Vincent, are you a veteran yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| With regard to the housing program that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| I noticed you mentioned that it goes through the VA, or it's funded through the VA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| Is that a permanent housing, transitional housing, rapid housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| What are we looking at for that part of your program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| All of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| We have different forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| We have different categories that the veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| and their families can fit into as for ideally it's going towards permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6990)|
| 1:56:37| but it's rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| We have funds available for each section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| And we also use HUD-VASH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| I mean, we've referred them to the Section 8 housing, whatever we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| We use whatever we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| And I think that kind of goes in line with what we talked about at the beginning of our meeting this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7016)|
| 1:57:04| about there's not any one solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| There's multiple different ways of coming at the issue, whether it's permanent or transitional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| So I appreciate that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| The last thing I was just curious about was with all of the deployments that we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| or have seen in the last 10 years for our service members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| are you seeing a change any in the age of the folks that are coming in to seek services with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7050)|
| 1:57:40| Yes, we are seeing a little bit of a change where some of the older generation, like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7060)|
| 1:57:51| because of certain situations that have changed and come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| some of them have fallen into hard times and they need help staying in the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| which is another thing that we can do is help veterans stay in their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| And as far as the younger veterans, we're not seeing a whole big number of younger veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| and we're not sure the reason why except that we feel that their families are stepping in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| taking care of them and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| And the other thing with our program is that as long as it covers all active duty folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| as long as they have one day of active duty service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| and it also covers our National Guard and Reserve as long as they've been activated by presidential order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| So that opens it up to a lot of people, especially with the 278th we've got here and the medical unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7120)|
| 1:58:49| I forget what their number is, but that also opens it up that we can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| And we do have funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| When we originally got the grant renewal, it was a $5 million grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| Part of the problem we have is finding landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| We're down to our last two, and I'm sure they'll be quick because they represent small organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| with small portfolios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| I'm kidding about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| The first one is Misty Goodwin with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| And, Mike, there also is one agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| I'm Misty Goodwin with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| and thank you for having us here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| And my work address is 2247 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| My home address is 6729 Bonneville Drive out in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| I'm going to get to the family question that you've been asking about all night in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| But first I just wanted to mention CAC does a lot of things in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| And if you're not familiar with us, one of our biggest missions is to provide homeless prevention assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| That's our favorite thing to do because it's cheaper, and it's certainly more compassionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| So we do things like pay a lot of utility bills, do weatherization on homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| and provide case management to keep people housed, rental assistance, mortgage assistance, and home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7218)|
| 2:00:27| And so I just wanted to give that a mention because that is really what we love to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| I am over our case management services at CAC, and we have a lot of different case managers that do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7232)|
| 2:00:40| And one of our programs that you're most familiar with, I hope, would be our CAC Case Management Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| and that is a program that works with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| We partner and have four case managers that work in their elderly disabled high-rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| So we provide case management based on the referrals that we get from the managers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| who they identify folks who are at risk or possibly they have violated their lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7261)|
| 2:01:07| and they are in trouble, and they might end up on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| A lot of the folks that we get were formerly homeless that were placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| or just found the housing on their own and ended up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| So our goal there is to keep those folks housed to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| Right now we are seeing referrals mainly on housekeeping issues, people that can't pay the rent, substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| a lot of folks keeping visitors that are beyond the allowed time at KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| and so folks bring in house guests that they're not allowed to have long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| So we try to work in some cases to either help those people find somewhere else to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| or just let the individual know that they've really got to get that person out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| Right now we're serving about 144 individuals, and that's this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| and there's been two so far that have left without housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| and that was just because at the end of the day they really didn't participate with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| to work towards finding alternative housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| but that's our goal when someone can't make it or really can't save them for one reason or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| is to find alternative housing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| Other programs we offer that I'm here to speak about would be our other homeless services programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| and those are all under the umbrella called Home Revamp, and in that program we serve families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| we serve vulnerable seniors, and we're serving youth at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7351)|
| 2:02:37| and we also provide outreach to the camps and folks that live on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| We've been doing that for a long time here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| We have two case managers that have been with us for over 22 years doing outreach in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| to try to engage folks to go into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| First let me just kind of break down quickly those populations and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| In terms of families, to get to your answer, we on an average see about 250 to 275 families per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7378)|
| 2:03:08| and that seems to be holding steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| I was looking at the numbers while I was waiting to speak, and I looked at 2015, 2016, and 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| and it's averaging probably right there between that 250 to 275,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| although Lisa just told me that last night we had 211 families that were homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| so perhaps we're making a dent in that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| So what we do at CAC is we have programs that work and partner with CARM and Salvation Army as well as Family Promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7411)|
| 2:03:41| and we help provide case management to get those families housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| On any given night, though, we see about 35 families that are living in their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| and the reason for that is because there's really just about 20 spaces available for families to stay the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| and shelter in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| We have very limited shelter space for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| So we see a lot of families that are doubled up living in overcrowded situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| that may not even be checking in with services or even reported in HMIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| so we do think that that number is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| Our programs serve a little over 200 families a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| and we house those folks and stick with them six months after they get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| Right now it's taking about two to three months to get our families housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| Larger families are taking a little longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| and that's just because there's limited large apartments that can house families that are five and six family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7467)|
| 2:04:38| And so we have six case managers currently working with families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7478)|
| 2:04:47| and so we're really able to help stabilize those families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| and then we have one case manager that can also take folks on that are maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| they need some additional case management beyond that six months to stabilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| and hopefully just increase their self-sufficiency and be able to stay stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| or maybe get a better job or a living wage position or go back to school if that's something they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| and we have programs that try and help support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| In addition, I mentioned we work with seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| We partner with Samaritan Place at Catholic Charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| We found that they have 16 shelter beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| and that's for the really vulnerable seniors that really can't make it at CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| that they're just not able to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| And so we partnered with Samaritan Place, honestly, to get those seniors moved out quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| so we had beds to move additional seniors in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| And so last year we served over 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| I think we actually housed 88 seniors in housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| and they are taking us about a month to two months to get into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| and that's just because they have some priority when they're homeless and they're a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| We get some priority with KCDC for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| We get referrals from hospitals and nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| seniors that have experienced elder abuse, financial exploitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| they're low income and just can't keep up with the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| I've seen a growth in that area, about 100 seniors difference between last year and this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7569)|
| 2:06:15| and I think that we will continue to see that number grow just with the baby boomers and as folks get older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| The other program we have is our Youth Wins program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| and as David mentioned earlier, the youth is sort of that hidden population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| that we're just now beginning to really dig in and find out how many youth are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| And so in terms of being able to answer whether that population has grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| yes, but we believe that's because we're just doing a better job at capturing that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| About two years ago, we got a phone call from Halls High School about two teenagers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| that were sleeping in the back of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| It was cold, it was really rainy that week, and they were living in a tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| and the social worker realized they were homeless because when they came into school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| their clothes were soaking wet and they hadn't changed in a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| And so the social worker just happened to call into our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| and we really hadn't dealt with homeless youth before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| but one of our case managers said, I'll go out there and I'll meet with them and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| And so what we found when we really didn't know what we were doing with youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| because we didn't know what services were out there for them exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| but what we found is there weren't many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| Since the runaway shelter closed, Helen Ross McNabb has a youth shelter for some of these kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7644)|
| 2:07:33| but some of them, just given their past, they're not wanting to engage in shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| and they just feel like they want to just be on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| And as David also mentioned, going to CARM and some of the traditional shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| is just not something that they've been interested in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| So it's been a learning experience, but what we've done with that is worked with Salvation Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| to partner to take some of the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| We've also found two landlords so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| We're still working on that to take some of our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| We've got one lady that has a couple of houses that she's broken out into rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| and she's renting the rooms and we found that that really works well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| for these youth when they're together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| And then they're all working and trying to go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| and just keep it together long enough to get a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| and to go back to college or go to school and stay in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| Last year we had 20 referrals from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| We are now partnering with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| We just received a United Way grant to work with more youth, and we're serving about 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| But last year we received 20 referrals from Knox County from students that were 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| that needed to graduate but were struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| And out of those 20, 11 of those kids graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| So this year we're hoping to have better numbers and really work with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| and we're getting referrals every day from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| to really try to get these kids through graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| so we can then help them hopefully move on into college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| or into David's program and Knox leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| We've also been working very closely with them to help these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| But that is definitely an issue that I would agree with David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| something that we really need to keep our eye on and focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| and we're all concerned and working on that through the Homeless Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| The last piece, I'm trying to move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| I know you guys have been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| So the last piece is I just wanted to talk just for a second more about our REACH program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| which is our two guys that do the outreach into the camps and on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| So in Knoxville, pretty much our two guys are what we call traditional outreach workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| McNabb has Sean Griffith, who's here, that does the outreach to the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| They also have another gentleman, and I'm sure they're going to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| some outreach for some folks that have mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| But our guys have been doing this for 22 years, and so when Mike gets a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| and they say there's a couple of people living out in an old abandoned building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| and we really need you guys to go out and check it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| Carl and Roosevelt are our guys that go and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| And we get calls from folks where they're maybe sleeping in a tent in the backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| they're sleeping in a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| We do a lot of the homeless verification letters to make sure that the situation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| what it presents to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| And then the guys work really hard to try to engage those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Some of the people, not too long ago we did a survey down under the bridge to talk to some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| and I was just amazed at the number of the people down there that knew Carl and Roosevelt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| and for them to say how long folks had been homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| And so it takes a long time sometimes to talk people to go into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| but we've housed a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| We also receive an ESG grant from you all, which is our rehousing grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| So the way that we're able to house these folks is through paying deposits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| paying off back bills that sometimes is a big barrier for people to go into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| And so we just received a grant or just applied for a grant with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| and it's through THDA to get additional money to do that in the upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| but that's definitely key to get our folks stably housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| And just quickly wanted to just say last year as a whole, between our seniors, our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7865)|
| 2:11:12| the folks that are living on the streets and our families, we housed 828 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| 447 of those were children who went into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| And so we use scattered site housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| We use KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| We work really closely with Debbie to get Section 8 vouchers for families that need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| But we really kind of look at the person and their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| A lot of the folks that Carl and Roosevelt go out and do outreach can't go to KCDC housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| because of their background or something that's happened that's keeping them out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| So we have to get creative with finding landlords to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| But as a whole, I think we kind of got the bases covered with who all we're trying to serve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| But we work and attend Homeless Coalition and just try to be a partner where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| Ms. Goodwin, we appreciate so much you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| Are there any questions of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Ms. Goodwin, I just had a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| First off, I thought it was a great point you made at the beginning addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| just addressing those who are vulnerable and then trying to intervene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| so that they don't end up in a homelessness situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| And this may not be the right question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| It may be kind of more broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| But, you know, some of the, like the CHAMP program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| and some of these other things that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| are there some ways that we can try to address that better than we already are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7951)|
| 2:12:38| so that maybe there is some attempt at getting into some intervention, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| where it's a little bit less expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| and it's certainly less traumatic on the individuals that are dealing with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| I'm not certain that we would really be identifying that through the CHAMP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| because in order to even sort of enter that system, they have to be literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| But I will say that just as a network of agency between BMC and the Refuge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| Salvation Army has some financial assistance they have available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| and CAC is pretty well known for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| The issue with us is it just depends on what kind of funding we have at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| We just finished providing some utility assistance and rental assistance to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| and literally ran through over $200,000 in a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| and the majority of that was spent on utility bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| because that is a huge need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| And to be honest with you, I don't think any of us could have any amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| to pay the utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| This past winter was a bad winter, and so our low-income seniors that are housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| we had a list of over 220 recipients of Mobile Meals that we identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| We literally pulled all of their utility bills to see if they needed assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| to try to help those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| I wish that we had more funding to be able to stop it before it started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| and I think we do the best we can with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| And then based on one of the comments you had made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| I was just wondering, of those that you serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| and certainly you were talking about families as well, but in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| what are we looking at with regard to employment for those folks that you're serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| Are we looking at folks that are currently employed but can't find affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| or are we looking at folks that don't have employment and maybe just can't find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| I think I would say that's a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| I think we get some families that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| we get a lot of families that have experienced domestic violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| and so they've either had to, you know, just leave completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| and sort of abandon their situation, which also means they may have lost their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| Sometimes people are living one paycheck away from homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| and so we see that a lot with our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| But part of our program is to help them get back on their feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| certainly look at housing first, but also in the process of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| talking about getting employment and helping people go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| Our case managers have been with us for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| and that's one good thing about CAC is we don't have a lot of turnovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| So we have seasoned case managers who know resources and have a lot of connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| and so we pull from that and try to help people get jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| We've got a few that are drawing disability here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| and so when we identify those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| we try to put them in affordable housing that we know they're going to be able to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| and I think all of us would say we do that, you know, try to look at the whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| The issue is we've got a lot of single moms, and so even with their incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| even if they've got a good job, most of them don't make a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| It's hard to go back to school when you've got three kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| and trying to just stay afloat with a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| And so a lot of these single moms are doing the best they can on minimum wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| and what we know is that Knoxville housing at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| is really not conducive to being able to have a family who's living without a good-paying job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8152)|
| 2:16:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| So I think you mentioned a while ago if there were folks who were in KCDC housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| and in danger of losing their housing because of various problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| you guys are able to step in and provide case management or assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| What triggers that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| And I guess the reason I ask is I have constituents that will be concerned about a tenant, a neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8181)|
| 2:16:31| where it's become a nuisance property due to what you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| maybe someone else has moved in and there's nuisance problems, drug use, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| that's causing instability in the entire block or area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| And so the response is to call KCDC and complain about the tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| and ask for them to be evicted or call KPD and file complaints, noise complaints, about the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| But if KCDC evicts that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| then we just have another homeless person who's going to have difficulty finding a new place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| So how do you trigger getting that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| When the complaints come into KCD or what's happening there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| Well, unfortunately, I wish that we had case managers that cover all of the KCDC properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| because I would love nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| Because this is an individual house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| It's not one of the towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| And we are not, we just don't have enough case managers to be able to serve all of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| Unfortunately, because I, in my position, I kind of see all the folks that are homeless who go into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| and then they sort of, you know, they come for rental assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| and then we see them sometimes end up back homeless again because we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| we're not able to have that intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Right now, we're just in the four properties of KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| and what triggers that is that they've done something to violate their lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| or the manager just thinks that they might do something that's going to be a violation of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| But at the moment, we are, you know, we just don't have enough case managers to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8279)|
| 2:18:06| I wish we did because it would make a huge impact on who we're able to keep housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| and intervene with even a family who's struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| They've lost their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| They can't pay their utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| They lose their voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| They end up in the cycle again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| Ms. Goodwin, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| And finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| Last but not least, we have Helen Ross McNabb, Senator, and Leanne Heumann-Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8308)|
| 2:18:39| Thanks for hanging with us, Leanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| You might want to wait until I turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| Thank you for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| My name is Leanne Heumann-Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| I'm the Regional Clinical Vice President for the Helen Ross McNabb Center, 201 West Springdale Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8327)|
| 2:18:54| And I'm here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| My name is Michael Waltke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| I'm the Senior Director of Clinical Services, and I am at 205 West Springdale Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| So you all heard a lot of information tonight about the issue of individuals who experience homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| or are at risk of experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| I would say that our niche in that service delivery is for individuals who have a serious and persistent mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| an addiction, or children at risk and who are homeless, and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| If I can step back just a little bit, I would say that the Helen Ross McNabb Center is a behavioral health center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| serving mental health, addiction, social services, as well as crisis services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| So while we have divisions of homeless programming unique just for individuals who are experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| there are individuals that we serve every day in numerous programming that are at risk of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| And so it's important to us that for the work that we do, that we believe everyone does better in their treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8386)|
| 2:19:54| if they have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| So it's our job to be able to help them access that in any program that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| Today, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the services that we provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| and Michael's going to talk to you a little bit about the housing programming, the houses that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| We have nine different programming identified just for individuals who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| What you're going to hear about all of them are they're very similar in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| but I have some takeaways for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| I would hope that you hear throughout the explanation of the programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| that a lot of what we do is outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| That's very important for individuals who are mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| It takes numerous outreach and engagement to build trust and rapport with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| to even get them to take the first step into trusting you to seek that step of seeking housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| We serve about 3,500 individuals and families each year just in our programming for homelessness alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8448)|
| 2:20:56| We access our full continuum of services for those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| as well as our community's continuum of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| A lot of our programming for this population becomes very intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| so you'll see a small number of individuals served because their needs and challenges are very unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| and their challenges are many at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| The staff that we have, we train them specifically in understanding the complexity of mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8476)|
| 2:21:23| and addiction disorders, so we want to make sure that the case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| and outreach workers that we send out have that expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| as well as working with families and children with serious and emotional disturbances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| The first program I'm going to talk to you a little bit about is our PATH program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| It is the oldest program that we've had at the Center for Individuals with Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| It's been there at least 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| It is a federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| It's been identified to have outreach workers go out in the community to identify adults who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| to try to encourage and seek them and get them into treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| It is short term, but the thought is we're going to link them into other mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8517)|
| 2:22:04| It is state and federal funded, along with a match grant from the Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8524)|
| 2:22:09| Mike talked about this a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| We do have the SOAR program for individuals that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| It's very challenging at times to figure out and fill out all of the requirements necessary to get SSI or SSDI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8535)|
| 2:22:23| so we have a case manager that actually helps the process of helping that individual fill that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| and expedite that with the official departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| We also have funds for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| We have what's called inpatient target transitional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| and it was used with dollars that were saved at the closing of Lakeshore Psychiatric Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8560)|
| 2:22:46| the area regional psych hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| So we have about $120,000 set aside for individuals who have a mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| who are either in an inpatient psychiatric facility or in a crisis stabilization unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| that we're able to use for housing, hotels, services to help them to bridge that so they won't become homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8580)|
| 2:23:08| We have the CABHI program, which is a cooperative agreement to benefit homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8588)|
| 2:23:14| It's a long name, just talking about a team that goes out in the community that includes peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8594)|
| 2:23:22| and vocational specialists to help individuals who are at risk at homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| That's also federally funded through the state of Tennessee that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| We got a new program that's federally funded through SAMHSA called Homeless Family Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| and we work that with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| It's a subcontract with the University of Tennessee through a research grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| So those are kind of all of the programs that we serve for adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| We have a full continuum of the same programs for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| We have street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| You may hear a lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Street outreach is individuals who go out in teams into the community to identify transitional youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8637)|
| 2:24:04| and the ages for that is around 12 to 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| They have served over 2,600 individuals, adolescents, through this outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| and engaged 218 into greater core services over the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| and that is funded through the Department of Health and Human Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| We have the Transitional Living Program, which is also actually 16 to 22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| for runaway homeless youth transitioning into adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| So we connect them with caring adults as well as stable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| and we make sure that the youth have access to training, counseling, medical care, education, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| and we're able to house them for a year and a half up to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| And they serve over 80 youth annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| It's also funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| We also have the BASIC Center, which is you've probably heard of Safe Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| Runaway Shelter Safe Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| It is serving youth homeless and streeped ages 12 to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| So that program served 220 individuals in services and got 165 in safe shelter programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8707)|
| 2:25:16| and we call them homes where when we closed the runaway shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| we opened up homes for individuals to take homeless youth into their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| and we train parents to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| So that's been pretty successful, I think, over the past two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| that we've been doing that program to serve individuals who are in need of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| So, Michael, do you want to talk about housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| Thank you, Leigh Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| I'm just moving this up for fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| Again, my name is Michael, and I am going to go fast because it's 7.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| What I would want you to know is we do have a homeless continuum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| and then on the other side we do offer permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| So within Knox County we have housing located in Hamilton County and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| In Knox County we offer 100 units of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| and we follow a scattered site model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| So all 100 of those units are broken up among 11 different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8766)|
| 2:26:12| Eight of those are apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| and there typically are going to be 8 to 16 units per complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| We also offer three homes where we allow three people each to rent out a bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| and then they share the common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| What I would want you to know about our housing is we really have three core requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| that we're looking at for eligibility because we do want to focus in on our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| as a community mental health center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| So the first is that you do have to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| So all of our sites are for people who are coming directly from homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| Now the definition can be different based on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| but everybody who's coming in is somebody who's either living on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| living in the shelter, or maybe couch homeless or they're living with family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| The other thing is you do have to have some type of behavioral health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| So, again, we're a community mental health center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| so we are focused in on the people who have either a mental illness or an addictions issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| The third thing is that you have to have a low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| which for us means that you have an income that's at or below 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| of the adjusted median income for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| Now for Knox County, that means you could have an income up to about $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| Most of our clients are on Social Security or disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| so their income is about $12,000 a year, and then we take 30% of that for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8846)|
| 2:27:32| Outside of those three main requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| we do have 22 units that are specifically prioritizing veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| and so all of those units are being filled by the VASH voucher program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| and those referrals come from the VA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| We also have 32 units that are prioritizing single parents and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| So those are the specialty populations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| In addition to that, I think Mike mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| we are in the process of building a new location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| that will add 10 additional veterans units for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| I think that's pretty much it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| I guess the only thing I would add is that these are permanent supportive housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| so it's very similar to what you've heard from everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| We're not just housing folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| What we've learned is that you have to provide the supportive service along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| So all of our housing does have a resident manager attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| That's somebody who is a peer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| They're in recovery from an addiction or mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| They live on site, and they really are eyes and ears for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| So if somebody has a need for a clinical intervention, they let our clinical staff know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8914)|
| 2:28:39| If there's a maintenance issue, they let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| If somebody's locked themselves out of their apartment, which happens quite frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| they let that person back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| The second supportive service that you're going to see at all of those locations is the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| So all of our tenants do have access to someone who's going to work with them in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| to make sure that all of their psychosocial needs are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| So do they have food? Do they have housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| Do they have clothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| And do they have mental health treatment and medical treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| Because what we do see with most of our tenants is they have very complex mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| and they have very complex medical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| So now that is actually it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| Do you have any questions for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| Leanne and Michael, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| Does anybody have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| You're in the tough spot of being right before dinner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| That makes it tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| I was going to say, I told Mike that I would make sure that I mentioned that as part of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| we are on the Homeless Coalition and the Homeless Youth Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| and what you will hear about as council members throughout next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| is an effort on the community's behalf to create a response to HUD's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8985)|
| 2:29:52| Youth Homeless Demonstration Grant that they're going to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| And so we want to kind of get that in your mind ahead of time to be thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| This community will have to come up with a coordinated community plan to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| so you'll hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| My question was with regard to substance abuse and then with regard to mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9008)|
| 2:30:18| how long is the wait list for treatment for those two different issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9018)|
| 2:30:27| And I basically wanted to get an idea of the need that's out there that I know you're working as hard as you can to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9027)|
| 2:30:36| but what are we looking at that is unmet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| What I would say as far as addiction treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| the wait list for that has gotten much better over the past couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| with the additional funding through the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| So it used to be six months if somebody wanted to call and ask for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| Now it's much sooner than that, and depending on which program, what their use is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| depending on what they are using, then we can get them in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| So that's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| I will say the unique challenge for this population is that it's very difficult for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9077)|
| 2:31:25| who is experiencing homelessness to engage in A&E treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| and go through that whole process of getting there and calling and getting an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| and getting on the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| So I think this community has done a very good job of working with individuals in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| to get them into services, but it just adds another challenge for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| For mental health, we do provide, and I will go back to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| there will be more funding for addiction treatment coming into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| so we're very hopeful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| As far as mental health treatment, we do provide behavioral health safety net funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| for individuals who are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| There are caps on that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| It is through the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| but if they meet criteria, and most of the individuals in that situation would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| as long as we can get them through identification process and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| then we can get them on to the behavioral health safety net program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9142)|
| 2:32:23| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| So just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| See, now I'm getting so tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| You talked about helping people get signed up for their SSDI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9150)|
