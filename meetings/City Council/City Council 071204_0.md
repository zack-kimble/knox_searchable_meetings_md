| 0:07:10| That's this Thursday at 5 p.m., and they'll have all the architect's renderings, et cetera, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Second, I want to remind all those here, but those watching and here tonight in the audience as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| the inauguration for the Mayor, City Judge, and four members of Council will be December 15th at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| at the recently or almost about to be reopened World's Fair Park Amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| So we invite you all to come and dress warmly in case it's not a warm day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| I want to remind Council that the reorganization we've done on staff that you've gotten to notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| well, I guess officially it has to come through here, but for our practical purposes, we've put those in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| And so if you need any questions, you can go ahead and direct them as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| Also some good news on Brownlow School, I think you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I want to thank Council for supporting the policy of designating one parcel redevelopment areas for historic neighborhood schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| It's allowed us to use the tools that come with a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| and to work with the developers to get this historic school rehabilitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| and eventually occupied on the tax rolls and benefiting that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| Lastly, the last thing I have is last year, if you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| we started something that we call the Innovation Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| with the idea that in local government it's easy to keep doing things the way you've always done them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| but you end up kind of pretty much where you've always been if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| And so we took time out to say we want to recognize an effort within city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| that brings true innovation and makes better government happen on a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Last year, if you remember, the award was the Chronic Problem Properties Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| which brought together different parts of our city government, whether it be police, community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| public service, engineering, to work on certain properties which were causing an inordinate share of problems locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| And we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| This year, it's my pleasure to recognize the 2007 winners of the Innovator Award for city government to the Fifth and Broadway Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=547)|
| 0:09:18| They have done extraordinary work for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| And I'd love just to – I won't take long on this, but it's important to recognize what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| A couple of years ago, I asked some folks in city government to work on a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| surrounding the Fifth and Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| One of the major areas of concern there centered on homelessness and the homeless service agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| some of the neighborhoods surrounding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| There was some contentiousness, I think would be a mild word to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| as different businesses and neighborhoods and some of the mission agencies were learning how to be neighbors together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| And our response was to try to reach out to those folks and see if we could all sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| and come up with a better way of addressing the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| And I asked Councilman Woodhull to co-chair with Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| The group met regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| And if you'd been to one of the first meetings, you thought, man, this is going to be tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| because the first meeting felt more acrimonious and contentious than it did anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| But they moved into being very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| I want to thanks to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| We now have KPD officers working with social service providers as they undertake camp cleanups throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| We have a successful aggressive panhandling ordinance, thanks to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| Thanks to this group, we relocated the city's craft center on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| And this group helped the city align the community development's facade grant policy with their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| But most importantly, really, with the help and energy of this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| they're pursuing real change through what we now call the Downtown North Redevelopment Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| We've moved, and this is something I think is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| we've moved from disinvestment in that area to investment in the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| I'm proud of these folks who worked really hard and came together and kept their personal interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| but put aside some of their differences to try to figure out how we could do it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| And that's why I want to recognize them and name them as this year's winner of the Innovation Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| I'm going to ask them just to come and stand in front here, if I call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| There are several city employees on that list, and as I call your name, if you'd come forward, we'd love to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Chris Woodhull, Michael Dunthorne, Roger Noe was a city employee at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| He's not anymore, but he's been incredibly helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Gordon Catlett, Kathy Chesney, and Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| From outside city government but with a government-related entity from Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| Mike Carberry and Renee Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Grant Rosenberg from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Alvin Nance from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I think I did see Alvin here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Thanks to Alvin and Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| We also owe a tremendous thanks to those from the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| David Nix from Park Ridge, Patrick McInturff and Tina Rosling from Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| Mark Hipshire from Fort Sanders, Daniel Hsu from Old North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Duane Greve from Emory Place, Pastor Meisenheimer from St. John's Lutheran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| and also Jenny Weatherstone, Bert Rosen, and Major Vick from Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| If you all would join me, and here come Pastor Meisenheimer and Bert to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| If you all would join me, these folks met frequently, took on the hard issues together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| and we came up with a much better solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| On behalf of all of you, we want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=743)|
| 0:12:38| We very much appreciate everything you all did, all the time you took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| and the fact that you took on a very difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| We're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| We still have a lot of things to wrestle through, but you set a good model for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| on how to answer your hard problems, and I appreciate you taking all the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=770)|
| 0:13:03| Okay, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I put at everybody's place here a copy of a draft resolution that will be on the agenda in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| This is asking MPC to look at how we do commercial zoning to make some revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Mark Donaldson drafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| I wanted to get it out to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| We've had a lot of discussions at the last couple meetings about some of the challenges with our current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| and give people a chance to look at it and make any suggestions about improvements in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| So that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Second, I wanted to just remind folks that this Friday is the annual Project Homeless Connect event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| which I guess is going to be down at the old convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Again, it's a wonderful opportunity for bringing a lot of the homeless folks together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| with a lot of the service providers and fixing some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Every year I know teeth get fixed, which we can thank Ms. Pilo for helping with, as well as some lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| Housing happened, job opportunities, some wonderful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| And to announce there's still a need for volunteers to help that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| it's a great opportunity to be involved in fixing some of the problems with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| 830 to 330 is the time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you for reminding me of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| First, I apologize for being pokey, getting here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I had a family matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Second, for those following the process of the Tazewell Pike Beverly Task Force via public access television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| we met the Monday after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| We're moving forward in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| We will not be meeting, however, the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| There are some things that city engineering is going to be working on that's going to take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| The earliest we will meet again will be in January, and I'll make that announcement as time draws closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Ready to move on then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Stacey Bryson to the Board of Environmental Appeals for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16, Article 11, Section 16-420 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| to prohibit charitable solicitation on public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| There's a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| There are three people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| There are four people signed up to speak, all against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| There's no one signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| So, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I'll move to allow all four people to speak five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| I will just call those folks in order, and then you can come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I'll tell you how it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| It's Amanda Wilson, Jeff Jones, Ken Holbert, and T. Scott Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| And I will just let you all come up, and if you would come give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and please observe the five-minute rule, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Keep it to that at a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| My name is Amanda Wilson, and I reside at 712 Green Meadows Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| I'm a daughter of a retired city of Knoxville firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Most people understand immediately the reasons firefighters are called heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| After all, it takes a special kind of person to be willing to walk through fire to rescue a stranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| But my father and his fellow firefighters are heroes for other reasons as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| They fight for the lives of strangers beyond the call of duty when they hold out their boots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| to collect donations from the caring citizens of Knoxville for MDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| I've watched my father participate in boot day activities for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| and while my father being a firefighter connected us to the Muscular Dystrophy Association in a very special way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| my family shares a much closer bond with MDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| In 1982, at age five, a little girl was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| one of the diseases grouped under the umbrella of muscular dystrophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Her parents were told by specialists at Johns Hopkins Hospital that although there were medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| that would make their daughter's symptoms more bearable, there was no cure for MG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| They were also told that she probably would not live beyond her early 20s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| As the young girl grew older, her symptoms worsened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| There were times when she could not hold her eyes open, her speech was slurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| she experienced difficulty eating, and the muscles in her arms, hands, and legs began to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| During this time, researchers were learning more about the disease and how to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| By the time she was 11, doctors told the young girl and her parents about a surgical option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| that might slow down or even halt the progress of the myasthenia gravis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Shortly before her 12th birthday, she was wheeled into surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| If you're wondering what happened to that young girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| I'm happy to tell you that she not only survived the surgery, she is here in this room this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| I am that young girl, and this December I will be happy to celebrate my 32nd birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| I grew up in Knoxville, graduated from a Knox County high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| obtained my bachelor's degree from UT Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| and will graduate this month with a master's degree from UT Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| I'm speaking out here because I firmly believe that were it not for the firefighters in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| and across our nation, and the citizens who fill their boots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| I would not be able to stand in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| While my doctors told me years ago that I am in remission, there is still no cure for MG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Researchers are making great strides in their efforts, but there is still much research to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| I understand that you all have concerns for the safety of firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| and volunteers who stand at intersections to collect money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| as well as for the motorists traveling through those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| If you feel that you must move to further ensure the safety of the citizens and firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| create more stringent guidelines that will require safe practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| and proof of the validity of the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| In addition to the guidelines already in place, require safety workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| prohibit minors from collecting, prohibit charitable collection on streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| that will fund entertainment activities, require proof of insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and or require a highly visible presence to assure awareness by motorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| But please, in your haste to protect the citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| don't forget the local families who depend upon organizations like MDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| to protect them from life-threatening diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| In asking for the opportunity to continue such a valuable fundraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| we are not asking for anything out of the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| We are merely asking that motorists exercise the same amount of cautious awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| that they should exercise every time they operate their vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| What is volunteered by motorists that is extraordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| is the response firefighters have received year after year from citizens all over Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| who reach into their pockets or their car coin collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| to hand over anything they can spare knowing that every penny counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| What is beyond extraordinary is that our Knoxville firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| are asking your permission to be a special kind of hero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| When you vote on this ordinance, I ask you to keep in mind the volunteer spirit we so proudly cherish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| Please remember that Knoxvillians have already spoken out in favor of firefighters and MDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| by donating over $20,000 each year for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| Please remember that you are in a position of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| What you do with that power will have repercussions for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Your decision on this matter will reflect either a willingness on the part of our city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| to work with these charitable organizations in ways that will benefit our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| or a resounding lack thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I am asking you on behalf of those who have passed, those who are still fighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| and those who know firsthand the benefits of research funded by MDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| please don't take away one of the most successful fundraising events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| for the Muscular Dystrophy Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| an event that creates a bond between Knoxville's firefighters, its citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and the local MDA office in an effort to eradicate neuromuscular diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| To take away this opportunity would be a national embarrassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| considering the vast amount of money raised for MDA through boot day efforts across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| Jeff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1269)|
| 0:21:19| My name is Jeff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| I do not reside in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| I live in the county of Jefferson County, 121 Adelaide Drive in Dandridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| As I said, I'm not here as a city resident, but I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| I am a city employee of this great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| I am a firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| More than anything, though, I'm here as a dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| Just to give you a brief background that maybe you already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| the Muscular Dystrophy Association is not just here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| It is nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| It's a subject that is so important that they set aside time on Labor Day weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| and give it a whole day when what we call Jerry's kids stays on TV all day long to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| It's that important that national TV recognizes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| The Muscular Dystrophy Association just here in Knoxville alone touches over more than 1,000 families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| The Muscular Dystrophy Association covers over 40 different diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| It's something that I never really thought that much about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| I knew it came on on Labor Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| I'd watch it every once in a while until three years ago when it affected my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| I got to learn a little bit more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| My son has Duchenne muscular dystrophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| He's with me tonight sitting here in his chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| When we go out and collect money, I'm speaking personally now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| I'm not here as a representative of the fire department or his local union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| I'm just here as a dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| When we go out and we collect money, it's a personal thing that we do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| because all the guys will come up and they'll say, you know, I never really thought that much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| But now it's part of our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| It's your son that's affected by it, Roy's daughter that was affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| It's part of our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| When one member of our family gets it, it doesn't matter if it's one firefighter or 350 firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| It's a family event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| We all look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| The Muscular Dystrophy Association helps with braces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| They help with wheelchairs, walkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| They help with crutches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| They have support groups that they have here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| They have chat groups that you can get online and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| They have magazines, a community magazine that they put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| They help with clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| They help with treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| They have equipment loan and repair programs that will loan you a wheelchair if you need it at no cost to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| But all of this costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| It can't be done without the funds that are raised on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| I want to tell you this disease is not specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| It's not gender specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| It's not according to your economic status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| It doesn't matter how good or bad your clothes may be or what part of the city of Knoxville you live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| whether it be west or east or whether it be South Dakota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| These diseases are not religion specific or race specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| At any point in time, anyone in this room could be affected by muscular dystrophy in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| At any point in time during our lives, whether it be at birth or whether it be at age 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| we could be diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| We never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| The decision that this council will make tonight is not only going to affect the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| It's not only going to affect me and my child or the prior young lady that you heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| It's not just going to affect the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| The money that is raised goes into a national organization that affects people all over the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| It affects all 40-something diseases that this money goes into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| You may say, well, the little bit of money that's raised on the streets of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| how could it make that much difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| That $20,000 that we give sometimes, it may be the difference in the cure that my son has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| It may be the difference that my son walks again someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| It may be the difference that saves his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| You say it's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I do not know of one specific case, one recorded case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| where a firefighter has been hurt collecting on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| You say I have heard it called a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| It could be a traffic hazard, how we back traffic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| We have big red fire trucks, signs everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Everybody sees the uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| When the Shriners take money, everything, you know, you can see them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| It's very noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| If you can't see them, you don't need to be driving a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| As I've said, this affects not only me and my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| It not only affects the city of Knoxville, it affects all across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| I would like to ask you two questions at some point in time if you would answer for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| What started this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| What initiated this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| And why did you take this direction as to cut it out all together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| I would like to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Mr. Mayor, I've heard you give speech after speech in organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| and neighborhood organizations that this is a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| This is a great place to live and a great place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| If we're so busy that we can't stop and roll our window down for 30 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| to throw some pocket change in, what's really important to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1589)|

| 0:26:39| Ken Hobart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| Mr. Mayor, council members, and other members of the staff, I'm Ken Hobart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| I reside at 244 Country Walk Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| It's in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I do practice law in the city of Knoxville on Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| I'm here as a representative of the Tennessee Right to Life, more specifically the Knoxville chapter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| since we're the ones that's directly affected by the proposed action by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| What I'm fixing to say, I want to make sure that you understand I'm not trying to lecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1633)|
| 0:27:23| What I want to do is lay down a foundation as to why I do not believe this body should proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1643)|
| 0:27:32| in the manner that it has proceeded and the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| So don't think that I'm trying to be condescending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| I do not want to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I simply want to bring to your attention who you are as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| And that's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I took some time, as this gentleman before me raised the rhetorical question, how did this come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1675)|
| 0:28:05| What initiated this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| So I took the time to call the various agencies in the city of Knoxville to find out what sort of investigative work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1689)|
| 0:28:20| had taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Guess what I found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| You know, as a legislative body, one of the first things you have to do is to ascertain what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1709)|
| 0:28:40| And the facts are you have nothing before you to support what you're proposing to do except one thing, opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1720)|
| 0:28:54| That's all that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I've emailed every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And as far as I know, that's all you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| An opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| An opinion that's not predicated on any factual assertion of knowledge that would justify what you're proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1744)|
| 0:29:17| What do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| I've got the ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| It's been in existence for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| You've heard a recitation here of the amount of money that has been raised at these street corners for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1764)|
| 0:29:38| No accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| No accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| No studies by traffic engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| No reports from your police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Somebody got an idea that this is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| Well, as a practicing lawyer, I can tell you if I go into the courtroom and the principle that I'm saying here is true for you also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1796)|
| 0:30:09| if I tell the judge it's my opinion, the judge is going to say, well, that's great, Mr. Hobart, but that's not worth a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1809)|
| 0:30:20| Where are your facts to support your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| And, ladies and gentlemen, my investigation, you have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| Now, as a legislative body, I implore you, if you're going to do something, do it on the basis of some study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1829)|
| 0:30:40| A study that justifies what it is you're proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Legislation is a serious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| It affects this whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| And taking a historical ordinance and deciding I don't like it just because it's your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1851)|
| 0:31:05| and you think it's a bad law to allow solicitation at the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| Well, let's look at the preponderance of the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| The preponderance of the evidence is there have been literally hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1875)|
| 0:31:23| that have gone for the support of good causes affecting your family, these families, every family in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1883)|
| 0:31:33| without one incident that's cost the city of Knoxville one dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1893)|
| 0:31:42| And you propose on the basis of opinion this is not good law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| But you have no support for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| I submit to you that's not the way a legislative body should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| That's not the way to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Rather look at what this ordinance does for the citizens of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| And, folks, that's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| So I'm really shocked that this council would entertain removing this ordinance with no basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1933)|
| 0:32:25| You have nothing to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Yet you're faced with enormous public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| Don't pass this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1960)|
| 0:32:53| Mr. Mayor, members of council, I've been at the past two council sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| with regards to the charitable solicitation ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| and the promosed striking of the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| and basically making charitable solicitations on the streets of Knoxville both illegal and improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| I was allowed to speak, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| And at the last public forum I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and I told you that I appreciated your open ears and your open minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| and the fact that you would consider all positions prior to placing your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| with regards to the second reading of this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| As I promised you, members of Corbella Shrine Center met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| We had our own workshop with regards to suggestions incorporating what we felt like were realistic proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| in order to address some of the concerns that you shared with regards to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| We're not looking to draw a line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| We're not looking for a line of demarcation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| We're looking to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| We're looking to mend fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| We're looking to reach a compromise that allows us to continue the philanthropic work that we have started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2033)|
| 0:34:03| I started the tail of November providing you documentation and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| regarding what Shriners Hospitals do, the services that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| Last year in the East Tennessee area we provided services to over 1,700 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| affected by crippling injuries, birth defects, and by very serious burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| These children are transported either by air or by our own vans at no expense to their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| Medical treatment is provided at no expense to their families, and their families are put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| This is done completely out of our pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| It is a volunteer basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| In fact, we have a group at the Shrine Center known as the Road Runners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| that they drive those vans with those children and with those parents to our various hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| to provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| You know, at the last council meeting a statement was made to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| A number of you know me, and you know me as a practicing lawyer here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| and obviously I'm here as legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| but I'm here also representing an organization that I'm a member of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| my father's been a member of for over 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| and I'm very proud to wear the fez that I have on my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| And the statement was made, you know, that's a cute hat that you've got on your head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and, you know, if it's referred to as a cute hat or whatever it's referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| I'm proud to be recognized as a Shriner because, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| that cute hat has helped an awful lot of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and a lot of children that wouldn't have had that help without that cute hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| So no matter how you refer to it, no matter what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| understanding that on behalf of the Shrine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| what we've done is we've tried to reach out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| We have submitted information regarding our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| but not only our organization, but suggestions that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| if you're going to do something with the ordinance, to amend the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| to require safety, to require insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| We maintain a policy of insurance for our members soliciting on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| We provide a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| We pay our permitting fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| If you're going to have an ordinance, enforce the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| If you're concerned with folks running out in an intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| and having some sort of a situation where they're kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| then do something about that, address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Don't eliminate the good work that these various organizations are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| They've done it in a responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| For the past 57 years, the Shrine Center here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| has successfully solicited on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| We received almost $700,000 last year in the just one-day drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2205)|
| 0:36:56| Our budget, and I've provided you those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| is $1.97 million a day to operate these hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| You know, the question's been asked by the news media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| and the suggestion is, well, do it at other property locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Well, we do that at the discretion of the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| and we do that at a number of malls, Walmarts, Targets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| other businesses around the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| But the fact remains is that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| We're willing to work with compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| We're willing to do anything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| We're reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| We're looking to mend fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| We're looking to do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| We simply want the ability to solicit on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| It has been in conformity with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| And we simply ask for your vote opposing the removal of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| and the prohibition of solicitation on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| And we want you to read that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| What I sent you, that wasn't just to kill trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| That was to tell you what our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| what the organization I hold true to my heart, does on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| And it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Just like the gentleman said with regards to muscular dystrophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| it doesn't matter your socioeconomic status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| It doesn't matter the color of your skin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| It doesn't matter your religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| We provide those services free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| Allow us to keep providing those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| and please don't prohibit solicitation on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2312)|
| 0:38:48| Comments or questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Mr. Becker, and then I'll go to Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I want to actually start answering Mr. Jones' question about how this started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| because it's kind of indicative of one of the problems I think prohibiting this will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| What happened on this is I guess last July the firefighters were getting ready to do boot day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| and they actually did something that very few people seem to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| which is read the ordinance and discover that it's kind of outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| It still refers to McCollough Avenue instead of Martin Luther King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| and, you know, it's got some intersections on it that I don't think still even exist anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| and came in and asked this council to update it to say we've got some intersections that are outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| and we want to follow the law correctly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| And as we started the discussion, council didn't want to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| I'm not sure what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| We had some workshops and there was a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| I don't understand why people don't like it, but it obviously happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| The council in the workshop decided they wanted to prohibit this rather than update the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| And I think one of the problems with that that I wanted to consider is what happens once we prohibit this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| because we haven't been enforcing the ordinance as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| If you read it, when I was out one day with the firefighters at boot day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| we were at an illegal intersection and we were dressed illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| There are provisions in the law that actually say you have to wear white with a reflective vest over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| So there's a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| So I'd be concerned if we prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| I think what we do is we take the legitimate organizations here that do a good job and they stop doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| but the folks that are out doing it that are doing it unsafely continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| So I don't know if that works to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| I just want to argue I think there's a real point in giving that street solicitation adds to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| Some people give in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| We all knew this from our campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| You don't just do one campaign fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| You do lots of them, because people do give in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| And there are some people that will they're not going to mail in money to MDA or the Shriners Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| They're at that level where they're going to give something when it's in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| I think the street solicitation ensures that much better, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| than saying, you know, you've got to get Kroger's to allow you to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| because that's if Kroger's doesn't like what you're doing, they kick you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| But finally, I think most importantly, what I feel is we're creating the future of a city here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| and we do this with zoning, do this with everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| And while it would be nice to be out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| and maybe never have anybody bothering you asking you for money in an intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| I don't know if that's the city I want to live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| because I think I want a city that has some diversity, that allows a lot of different things to happen in a lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2490)|
| 0:41:43| And I think it's one of the strengths of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| We dislike that idea that was said, the phrase about Knoxville being a scruffy little city at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| but it's one of our charms. We're a little scruffy. We're not Disneyland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| So I'm going to be voting against this, and I hope everybody else will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| I don't think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| I'm going to wait and see if anybody else has anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I have a possible motion. I'm going to hold off for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Right now, I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Councilman Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I personally don't feel like we're scruffy in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| You know, it's extremely moving that this many people are this passionate about helping young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| and that you're willing to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| Actually, I have a question, so you may not actually, when I get to my point, you may not be clapping at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| But it's very, very moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| The organizations that are represented here are doing excellent work, amazing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2560)|
| 0:42:50| On some level, however, it kind of feels like we're doing the right thing the risky way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| It just feels that way, even though I'm very concerned about the very significant revenue stream that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2578)|
| 0:43:07| and that you need in order to do your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| There was some gentleman that said that just because we have an opinion that it feels unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| that we're just stopping it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| We do need to be concerned about just stopping anything just like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| and I'm not really quite sure what to do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| I don't know if it's an opinion, but it's an instinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Having people out in the street among cars, it feels unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2613)|
| 0:43:42| It looks unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| I did want to ask Chief Rayl, does the police have any kind of an opinion about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| or not this is a safe practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| Councilman Becker has made some interesting comments about this really hasn't even been on our radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| Perhaps there is a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Perhaps there is a way that it can be on our radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Well, as far as an opinion is concerned, no, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| But actually we have afforded this council a map of certain areas that we feel like would be an area that's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2649)|
| 0:44:19| more safe to solicit if you're going to allow solicitation on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| It affords an area of safety, whether it's utilization of a median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| or whether it's utilization of some concrete type of structure that would allow a citizen to be safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| to get out the roadway in case a car happens to be coming that way that is posing a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| But I do have those maps available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I know that we sent them out to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| I don't have enough for everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| But by saying you don't have an opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| and I know you're always extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| Well, certainly safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| We're not going to be able to come out and say, yes, it's in the best interest of anybody to get in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| unless they're rendering some sort of aid for some sort of hazard or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| You know, we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| But certainly it's our job to act as an enforcement tool for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| and we'll enforce any ordinance that you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| What is your experience in years past that there have not been incidences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| Well, to my knowledge, I'm unaware of any accident that has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| where somebody has solicited funds for charitable organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I appreciate the phone calls that I've received from people and the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| and the continuing dialogue no matter the medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| You know, one thing that I have grave concern is a lot of the intersection where folks are willing to solicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| Some of those are the people know them as the red light camera intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| And red light cameras are put at those intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| because those are some of the dangerous places where accidents have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| One intersection where folks, there's not a camera there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| but is at Broadway and Esri Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| That intersection is a lot more than Broadway and Esri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| There are a whole lot of streets feeding in and out of that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| whether it's, you know, Cedar Lane or Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And that's an intersection of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Also, Broadway at Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| One thing that I guess, to be blunt, the word to use is I was disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| It's very early on I talked to folks who were calling, saying, please don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| I said, would you all consider, rather than Broadway at Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| which at some point is about six lanes across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| move into, say, Whittle Springs right across from the fire hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Instead of Esri and Broadway, what about Esri and Jacksboro Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| which is also conveniently at a fire hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| And, you know, being blunt, it was a pretty swift rebuke that I received from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| when we were trying to, or at least I was trying to, come up with some sort of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| You know, I've had many long conversations with members of the Corbella Temple in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| about the right to life on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Nobody wants to see anybody get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Nobody wants to see funding diminished for these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| But the places, you know, people in these different organizations agree that some of the intersections are very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2864)|
| 0:47:54| Kingston, Pike, and Knowlton at Western Plaza, that's a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| So, you know, it's been tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| But, you know, I was, you know, even though Mr. Jones talked about compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| when I've tried to politely suggest things, I was just being, once again, disappointed at the reception received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| I think I'll thank Councilman Pilo is next and then Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Well, I will have to echo what Councilman Frost just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| My light was after his, so he had the opportunity to make those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| And someone, I think Mr. Jones might have asked, well, how did this all come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| Where did this come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| How did this get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| And, frankly, it was when the firemen came to us to review their permit and to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| And when that list of intersections was brought back to Council for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| and I don't think any of us anticipated this kind of five-month discussion and consideration of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| But, frankly, when I saw the intersections, which had been removed and then others added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| as a district council member, I was just stunned because the two intersections that Councilman Frost just mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2943)|
| 0:49:13| were intersections that for four years I had struggled to find some answers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| because there had been so many accidents at the Knowlton-Kingston Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| That intersection was added, a new intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| I simply couldn't sit still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I knew I would just get fried alive if I did because there had been so much concern about motorists being safe in that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2970)|
| 0:49:38| Well, the thought that we were going to put individuals into that intersection, there would be no median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| There would be no safe place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| There was traffic turning in all the arrows in every direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| And the arrows were not long enough for traffic to make its turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| So, consequently, the thought of people getting into that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| and also the intersection at North Shore, and I think I'm leaning on my microphone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| the intersection at Kingston Pike and North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| it's just a constant discussion about what we can do there with the engineering of that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| to make it safer for people who are trying to make their turns in all four directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| So that is where this came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| and that is where we began to realize that it's a different day and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| than when this ordinance was initially passed many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| Now, it's been said tonight that this is all based on opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Well, I suppose most things are based on opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| It comes down to that with an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| But I really take, well, I just want you to know that we have given a lot of consideration to studying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3049)|
| 0:51:00| what other areas allow solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Are you aware Knox County does not allow anyone to be permitted to solicit on their streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3065)|
| 0:51:13| You know, I wasn't aware of that until we looked into this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| And if Knox County does not feel it's wise, then I'm a Knox County resident too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| and I don't know that I want to be a city councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| and be unwise in deciding to allow solicitation in city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| That's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| It was very interesting to us to look at what we called peer cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| and what other cities do when this issue comes before them to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| And we discovered that Chattanooga, Nashville, Lexington, Kentucky, Asheville, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| Jackson, Mississippi, those are the ones I just remember off the top of my head, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| do not allow solicitation at intersections on public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| So I think this has been before a number of people who have attempted to make the best decision they can possibly make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3128)|
| 0:52:18| You know, if you ask me what my middle name is, it's fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| I feel like I'm raising funds for some organization almost every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| And I have done that for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| I appreciate what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| I'm a part of what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| But I don't believe that in conscience I would ever recommend to an organization that I belong to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| that they need to use the city street intersections or any intersections anywhere for raising funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3164)|
| 0:52:53| So that is a matter of my sense of wisdom and just experience in watching the drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3173)|
| 0:53:04| Frankly, I have had a number of people say I certainly hope that you will pass this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| because they have been concerned about many times they have seen situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| where narrowly people escaped some kind of incident at those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| This is not about charitable solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| This is about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| It is about wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| It is about responsibility and accountability on the part of your elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| That is, I can tell from your responses, a matter of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| But to me, it's a matter of personal commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Well, I have to agree with the gentleman who spoke about it being an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| because I think when we voted on this on first reading that I based my vote on the opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| I do think it's unsafe to be out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| I don't want to be out here standing around in the middle of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| But I do think that you all do have the right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| And I think it's worked successfully here, I think, for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| And I will be voting in opposition to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3253)|
| 0:54:22| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I just want to, you know, Mr. Frost, through all the discussions we had about the intersections allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| it was clearly red light intersections were not going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| So as far as Woodland and Broadway went, I mean, I stood out there for two and a half hours one day on Boo Tribe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| and did it, and it's not that dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| It does have a median going on several directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| So I think there are safe places to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| And that list that we talked about was developed with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| I mean, I sat in Lieutenant Boone's office while we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| I think it's also interesting in the list we got from Director Kaiser about what 12 sister cities do, six allow and six don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| So it's not like there's this unanimity that this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| And I guess I also want to ask, do you all in the Shriners, do you all do anything outside the city in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Do you all solicit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I thought you did, yeah, throughout East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| I mean, it's kind of interesting that Knox County prohibits it and it still happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| So I hope that we don't fall into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| And the sad part is if we prohibit this, I think the Shriners will stop in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| I don't think other groups will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| So, again, I don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| First of all, I wanted to pass along a question Vice Mayor asked earlier in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| and that is where did the Shriners, where did you park your little cars and motorcycles tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| We've had parking problems around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| You know, first of all, I wanted to say something to Mr. Holbert that we did have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| and we have done some extensive review of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| And some of the things that came to me initially I had some concerns with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| And as I investigated it with some of the organizations in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| I came to the conclusion that some of the real problems could be resolved in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| And with the insurance, for instance, we have also we have problems with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| We have a lot of illegitimate groups that go out into the streets and solicit, and they're not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| They don't follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| And so I think, you know, we have some enforcement issues that could be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| Secondly, no matter how you feel about people in the street, safe, not safe, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3403)|
| 0:56:52| I definitely understand that you budget annually, and this is quite a big part of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| And the prudent thing would be to do if we wanted to change this ordinance is to have a gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| some time at the very least, to give you the chance to go find alternative sources of fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| So whether you agree with it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| I think we at least owe it to those that have been following the laws that are on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| and have been getting permits and following the rules some time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| So I think that we should withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| I think we ought to go back to work on a new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| I think there's a lot of problems with the intersections, enforcements, and a number of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| Folks don't give us insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| And so I think we ought to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| I'm willing to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| We ought to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| We ought to go back with our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| And we ought to look at this issue all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| But no matter what, I think we should withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Was that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| I'll make the motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| That motion, as I understand it, has precedence over any other motion and is not debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Which motion did you ask about just now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| The withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Withdrawal is a priority motion, as is postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| There is yet another motion with even higher priority, but I haven't heard it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| Is this like Easter egg hunting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| What are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| Adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| Keep the city safe for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| We'll go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Would that be like to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| I mean, to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| A motion to table would have an even higher priority and is non-debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Well, I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Councilman Holquist has been trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Yeah, let me do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Since there's a motion on the floor in a second, I will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| I didn't know my light was off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| I thought I still had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Let me come back, because wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Let me go to Councilman Holquist and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Well, I was going to make the reason Mr. Swanson brought that up is because I asked him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| I'm going to make the motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| To table this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Then it has to be, if that passes, if it's to be brought back, it's got to be given public notice and put on an agenda to put it back on an agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3560)|
| 0:59:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Before it could be put back on the agenda for consideration, you'd have to have an item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| the consideration of which is to put it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| You'd have essentially a resolution to put this matter back on the agenda before it could come back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| But before that motion is made and seconded, I'd like to ask Mr. Jones a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| It is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| I'll second it just to keep official track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Go ahead, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| I guess you have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Mr. Jones, you heard about what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| You're here tonight as the one representative of the Shriner, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Are you all willing, despite what some folks have said to discuss, utilizing smaller intersections versus the major busy intersections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3615)|
| 1:00:27| Absolutely, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| I mean, we're willing to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| That's what we were trying to do with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I mean, we just want the ability to continue to solicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| And if, in fact, you received information to the contrary, I am acting as spokesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| I did speak to the potentate who's sitting on the row in front of me, and I'm speaking on behalf of Corbella Shrine Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| and that's our unified voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| We don't want to lose the right to solicit on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| And, you know, I was told a long time ago, you know, the pig gets fat and the hog gets slaughtered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| I'm not willing to reach too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| We'll take whatever we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| And I appreciate the question from Councilman Frost, which is kind of where I've been leaning in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| Let me say, you know, one thing, and I said this before, the thing that just troubles me greatly about this is how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3671)|
| 1:01:21| council is being painted as against folk who the Shriners work to help, against children who are burn victims, against folk who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3681)|
| 1:01:30| M.D., against people who participate in all sorts of activities to help those in our community that need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| And I think that's really unfortunate and actually very saddening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| This council has had two workshops on this and struggled mightily with, you know, how do we address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| And initially, when this was brought forth, I think the first along was when we looked at those intersections that were proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| as Councilman Frost has said earlier, Councilwoman Pillow alluded to, major intersections with a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| You know, I'm an attorney, not nearly as rich as Scott Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| I'm a poor folk's lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| But I hear the --I keep hearing the returning argument, well, there's never been a problem, there's never been an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| If you look at the law averages, that means it's not good in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| And then number two, you know, I don't want to wait for there to be a major accident and someone say, why don't you do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| So that's where I struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| And I would like to see if we found some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| What Councilman Frost is saying is that if the Shriners are willing to talk and any other organization willing to talk with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| the police department, maybe if this is postponed or either tabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| and we came up with some acceptable intersections that maybe everyone could look at and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| this helps to achieve the goal of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| I think that may be the win-win for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| You know, and I don't mean to speak for Councilman Frost, but I think that's kind of where he was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| And I'm really sharing that sentiment and what I hope we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| If the motion to table is seconded and we vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| it is my hope that this does not go away, that we do still engage in that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| because we have an antiquated ordinance on the books that has intersections on it that no longer exist and streets that no longer exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3794)|
| 1:03:24| And that becomes problematic for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| So I would be very supportive of us either postponing or tabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| and then discussing some other alternative intersections that we could take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| because I'm very, very concerned, you know, about those intersections that have been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Well, I would just echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| And, you know, the thought that's going through my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| the tragic situation in Anderson County where a child has had to die for people to really become concerned about some of the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3829)|
| 1:03:58| So I just think it requires us to seriously consider how we can find compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| But I think my disappointment has already been expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| When we talked about other intersections, we were just really told that wouldn't be agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3849)|
| 1:04:19| So, consequently, it put some of us in a position of having to oppose any more discussion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| We had an extended workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| We've had extended discussions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| and never have we had anyone before tonight really except in, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| a communication that we received recently from you, Mr. Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| indicate that there might be some possibility of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| And, you know, when there's just no possibility of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| then that really forces one who is very convicted about a situation to have to take a very hard line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| So, but I just kind of spoke in Councilman Brown's ear and said my fear is that this will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| It will be off the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| And we do have this very antiquated, totally unsatisfactory ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| which represents something where intersections aren't even there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| And my big problem with this is how we have all organizations fall under an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| Because right now we have a lot of organizations that are soliciting that have absolutely no permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| no ability to raise the funds for insurance and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And trying to treat every organization the same is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| something else that we have to consider seriously as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| I'm not sure whose light was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I'm going to go to Councilman Hookla since I don't think he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| Right now there's a motion to table, but there's not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| I want to clarify where we are to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Once it is seconded, then debate is cut off and we go immediately to vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| I was going to follow up on that very thing, but maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| Councilman Frost, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| I forgot to mention one thing that Mr. Jones did say earlier about someone making a comment about the fezzes of the curbelas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3972)|
| 1:06:21| Honestly, I don't remember who made it, but I feel pretty certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| I mean, everyone knows that you all wear your fezzes as a badge of honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| You participate in parades with your cars, no matter their size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| and you do that to draw attention because you're proud of your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| I just want to say I don't think anyone meant any harm towards your organization whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=3999)|
| 1:06:48| I mean, we certainly respect, all of us respect, what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Councilman Hookla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Just to help clarify, since we're still in discussion mode and there hasn't been a second on my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| the idea for a tabling action is to say this is not going to come back at a specific time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| which means it could never come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| But the alternative is that it's still, I mean, the other side of that coin is that it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| It's suspended, so to speak, with the implication that it could come back for consideration and voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4039)|
| 1:07:28| and I see that as a motivator to help make sure that everybody knows that this is still on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| and that if folks want to try to forge a compromise and work through a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| then this will hopefully be a motivator to say we want to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| And if we do nothing, then we may just choose to bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| If there's no attempt to find middle ground, no attempt to move towards the center, then we may just bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| I'm going to call on council's attorney, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| He wants to clarify real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I just want to clarify one thing about a motion to table, simply because I don't ever recall in 24 years of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| I don't recall a motion to table being adopted by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| So I want to make sure everyone understands the outcome of the motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| What it would do is it would put on the table this particular ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| and that particular ordinance could not come back for consideration by council without, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| it would have to be a resolution on the agenda calling for it to be placed back on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| That does not mean that some alternative addressing of this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| It doesn't mean the whole topic of intersection solicitation is on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| until you have a resolution to put it back on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Any other alternative to this particular ordinance could be placed on the agenda without first having a resolution to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4129)|
| 1:08:58| The only thing that would be placed on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| and would have to have a motion to come back on the agenda would be this particular ordinance as it exists at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| I mean, I appreciate where council is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| As the original maker of the original motion to change some of the intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| I'd sort of like to get some clarity on how this compromise is going to be arrived at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| Because, I mean, the firefighters came with suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Council didn't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Council asked us to talk to the police department for recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Council still didn't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| I don't think this is magically going to solve itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| So do we want to consider setting up a committee that involves the Shriners and the firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| and the Right to Life and some council people to come up with a compromise on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| I mean, do people have some ideas on how we are going to solve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| I don't let well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Well, just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| We kind of got in this pickle, Councilman Becker, because just a few folks were talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| So I have some concerns about it being discussed by just one or two people and not including the entire council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| So, basically, I really think this is a very public issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| It certainly is demonstrative that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| And I think it needs to be something where the discussions come before the entire council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| I would hate to see us with another situation, which some of us felt we could not support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| because simply we had not been involved in bringing the proposal forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| Yes, you asked us to meet with the police department and bring recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| So what you'd like now is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| I just personally think that atmosphere is going to be much more open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| that we all will have had the opportunity to have heard all of the comments and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| and we are asked to respond to people who email us or communicate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| and I would feel better if it were a totally open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| I might reassure the Boy Scouts who think that since we're on our first item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| and it's taking an hour and there's 30 items, we won't be here this time tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Let me say, Mr. Mayor, with regards to Councilman Becker's inquiry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| I think one of the problems with the suggestions that at least I have seen, my perception is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| that there was one fundamental premise that I think we need to shy away from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| and that is we need to find the busiest intersection that the most cars go through for the biggest bang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| And that's the impression I got from looking at those choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Now, that's the impression I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| I didn't say you said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| I didn't say anybody else said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| But if you look at all those intersections, they're very, very busy intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I know you can get a lot more money, I guess, in the bucket or the coffers if you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| but we've got to find a way to find some of those that are a little more safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| And I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| You implied there's been a couple of other lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| I haven't seen a list that kind of reflects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| I've just seen lists that either add more or have chosen some very busy intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| some that are very new that are actually still going through transitions a little bit, like Hall of Fame and Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| And we've got two or three intersections coming in there, and we've also got the interstate dumping in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| We've got a whole lot of things going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| People still don't know which way to turn, left or right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| And I've driven through there and seen automobile accidents in the middle of that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| and it's not a very old intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| So I think we've got to operate with a premise that how can we best allow those folks who wish to raise money this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| to maximize their efforts and make sure we have a safe operation, a safe intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| And some of those that are on that list, you know, I just think, you know, to me the premise was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| these are very large intersections with a lot of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| So I hope that whatever process we go through, we look at that not being our number one goal is to pick the most busiest intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4366)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I guess the question is, PILO sort of likes a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Do other folks like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| I mean, how are we going to not end up with three years for the next and dump this on the next council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| and have somebody come in and say the intersections are outdated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| How do we solve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| And is there a consensus that a workshop is what we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| You know, let me say, I guess as vice mayor, let me say that I think you probably have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| even if some people in council disagree, it may need to be a two-tiered system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| I think you probably necessarily have to have police, fire, maybe represent from the Shriners, Right to Life, MD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| you know, a couple of council members kind of get together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| here is a long list of considerations that we can get some basic information about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| but then that we have the open workshop where all of those are put on the table in front of council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| to take a look at, and I think that would get to Councilwoman PILO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| So I think maybe having a smaller group kind of come up with some things for us to consider is the way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| so that then we've got some good viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| But not bring it in ordinance form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Right, not bring it in ordinance form, but bring in, here are the ones we already had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| here are some additional intersections, and kind of have a group come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| So I think you may have to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| I was going to say a workshop might be the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| I don't think we'll all get it settled in one hour-and-a-half, two-hour workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| But I do feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| Well, let's stick with lights here, if we can stick with lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Following up on Councilman or Vice Mayor Brown's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| it does seem like this is the work of a committee, at least for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| I think that's what you're describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Since this council doesn't have a standing committee that would address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| perhaps the council could, as we have done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| create an ad hoc committee with some of the membership that you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| I think that's really what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| You just didn't use that language, but that's what I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| No, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| And I think the work of that committee then comes to a full council workshop for vetting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| and not in a, and I think what Councilwoman Pelos pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| she doesn't necessarily want to see, and I agree with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| that it come to us already in ordinance form, and here it is, take it or leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| It has to come to us as decision makers to sit down and say, okay, we think this deals with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Because contrary to what some folks think, I, too, have heard people say to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| as Councilwoman Pelos said and some others have alluded to, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| I really hope you guys do something about that because I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| So there are a group, there are people out there who tend to think that this is not really a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| I would just follow up with that saying I'd certainly be prepared to support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| but I do have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| and I still think it's a very viable motion based on the discussion we've had, and I'm hoping for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| And there's a motion second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| That, by Robert's rules, kind of terminates all discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| We'll go straight to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| And the motion on the floor is to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| And as Mr. Swanson reminds us, that doesn't mean this topic can't be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| It just can't be brought back up in this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| So all those in favor of tabling say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| That motion is tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you all for attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Excuse me one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| Before you all leave and while we're still here, I would ask, I think ask is the proper word to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| that Vice Mayor Brown pull together that ad hoc committee, whatever we're going to call it, and do that within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| well, by January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Let me ask that the Shriners, those folk who are representing Right to Life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| those folk who are representing the Minnesota District, who have been here today specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| give me the contact name of one individual from each organization that can be brought into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| And I will look to have a representative from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| We've got Chief Real here from the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| We have the chief here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| And then I'll work with council staff about, you know, putting those folk together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| and then having them go about doing their duty and then reporting back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| Ms. Peters is behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Perhaps she could get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| They could send a representative to give the information to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| You can give us a name before you leave tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| It would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| 9C is an ordinance to close a 15-foot alley from Sanderson Road to Clifton Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners, A&M Enterprises, Inc., 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Mr. Seymour has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| If I could speak on this item and the following three items all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| My name is Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Excuse me one second, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| If our guests who are leaving could please remember we have a meeting still going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| and hold your conversation until you get to the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| I think we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| I think it's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| Is that what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| No, it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| These items, these four items at last month's meeting were the subject of some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| It was postponed at that time for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| Since then, Mr. Cappiello, our client and I have discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| and I've tried to discuss it with some people around there and we've looked at the issue further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| I would propose a change in what we earlier submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| First, I've given you a little diagram here, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| The artist in our office has been out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| Where is Mr. Cain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| Not him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Where were you, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| The first two items are alley closures, and this property is bounded on the north by Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| It is C3 down to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| There is an alley through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| There is an alley that runs north-south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| Those are paper alleys, as I call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| They are not in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| The City of Knoxville does not object to their closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and all of the property owners surrounding them want those two alleys closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| As a matter of fact, there are encroachments on the alleys from some of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| Next, the original rezoning request was to change the property bounded on Sanderson here on the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4756)|
| 1:19:30| all the way over to the next street, Clifton Place, back to Carnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| We would ask that the plan amendment for that be withdrawn for lots 24 through 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4776)|
| 1:19:45| and that the plan amendment be approved for lots 31 and 32 only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| and that the same be done for the rezoning, and that an additional condition be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| The condition now is that the rear of the property, the southern boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| shall have a minimum 15-foot wide planting strip with a type A landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| That is fine, the southern border,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| but we would also request the same restriction along the eastern border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| where the property adjoins other residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Just add that as an additional condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Mr. Seymour, the portion where you're asking to add those conditions on essentially the backside of those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4824)|
| 1:20:34| where the paper alley exists now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Correct, right here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Would, with an alley closure, half of that would revert to each parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4838)|
| 1:20:47| And so 31 and 32 would get essentially half that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| And the alley is how wide, 10 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| Twelve feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| Twelve feet, so six feet of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Would that landscape buffer encompass that entire six feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| Yes, and an additional nine feet, be 15 feet along the eastern side here, the same as along the eastern side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4862)|
| 1:21:11| Okay, 15 feet, totally okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Do you have that in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I will e-mail it to the law department in the morning and the city recorder, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4888)|

| 1:21:47| We need an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Do you need an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| I don't think there's an amendment on the alley closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| It's the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| It's the rezoning and the plan amendment, E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=4914)|

| 1:26:04| There comes three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| If somebody could maybe just give us the 22nd history of what happened here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| and then we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| For 100 years, there was a clock on Gay Street that people used to meet at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| say, I'll meet you at the clock, and we'll go to the movie, we'll go to dinner, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| It's not there anymore, and a lot of folks in town thought we need that back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| and so there's been, I think, a pretty extraordinary fundraising drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| This Friday, we hope you'll all be there to help unveil the new clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| 530, right before the parade, so you already have a reason to be downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Does that mean, Mr. Blasius, that you're confident on the action of this council to approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| You'd give it to somebody else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Actually, the clock will be there whether you take it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| I just am very curious about did you have someone design the clock to be a replica,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| or was there a company that manufactured the clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| We found it with a vendor on the side of the road in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| And it looked so similar that we just decided to go buy it and solicit donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| Well, a couple of years earlier, there was a lot of stress and distress about that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| so thank you all for your generosity and your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Mr. Morris and Mr. Blasius, Mr. Warden, thank all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| It's a big group of people, and we appreciate you all's efforts in making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| I might add that Ann Marie Tugwell from Dewhurst Property couldn't be here with us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| but she was our other partner in crime, kind of just coordinating, but really a lot of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| a lot of corporations, a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| It's a great list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| We look forward to Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| That will be a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Thank you for making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| What kind of clock is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Analog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| It's a roller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Three different answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| A little old scruffy Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| They're in sales, not operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Are we ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| See you Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| 11C is a resolution approving the honorary name of Regas Square for that city block bounded by Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| Magnolia Avenue, Williams Street, and Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Requested by Councilmembers Bailey Hall, Roddy, Frost, Pelo, Holquist, and Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5301)|

| 1:28:28| Will you add my name to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| And mine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| And Mr. Regas is here, so he probably would like to wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Mr. Regas, would you like to say a quick word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| Just wave, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| Just briefly, thank you very much for the Regas family, for this recognition, for my father and my uncle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5326)|
| 1:28:55| and the oldest restaurant in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| A lot of young people learned the work ethic there, and they're all proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| I want to thank the Council, and Councilman Bailey headed up the committee on the street naming committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5343)|
| 1:29:13| and that was unanimous, and thank the MPC and all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Yeah, Mayor, I take it we'll put together some kind of ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| I think there's already a date set in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| Somebody knows this better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I saw Randy Kenner here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| Mr. Regas, do we have a date set for that already, for the naming celebration for Regas Square?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5375)|
| 1:29:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Do we, Mr. Regas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| We're working on getting a date, and everybody will be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5388)|
| 1:29:57| As long as it's under $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5405)|

| 1:30:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| 11D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute and deliver an agreement with Billy Casper Golf, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5412)|

| 1:30:22| requested by the Department of Community and Neighborhood Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| There are two people signed up to speak against this, Ms. Donna Hatcher and Mr. Phillip Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5428)|
| 1:30:39| Donna, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, my name is Donna Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| I live at 7733 Norwich Road, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| Our small business was involved in the bidding process, but I'm here tonight as a concerned citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5451)|
| 1:30:59| who, in my opinion, thinks that we could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| The golf industry has seen a shift in guest needs over the past decade as the game has grown in popularity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5462)|
| 1:31:11| The courses, menus, services, facilities have all had to adjust to the challenging needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| and now everyone is reaping the benefits of this shift to a more family-oriented lifestyle and environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| If I may borrow from the Mayor's December 3rd inaugural address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| we have spent many, many hours at our kitchen table working hard on our business plan and our dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| We were passionate about providing quality of play in our municipal course no different than a resort or country club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5497)|
| 1:31:46| We felt our enthusiasm and hard work and dedication in collaboration with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| would provide a quality experience for golfers of all play at a fair price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5511)|
| 1:32:00| I would like to quote, if they walk like a golfer, talk like a golfer, and think like a golfer, then they must be a golfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5520)|
| 1:32:10| My husband, as many of you know, can be short-spoken and to the point, but one thing he has always been is a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| He loves to contribute to the quality of lives to our youth in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| and we wanted to add to that in the youth programs that we offered our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| I ask that you produce a wise agreement, create a win-win solution, set the criteria that is justifiable, practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| and make sure that you take into account the community and interest and be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Mr. Phil Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| I'm Phil Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| I hope it's the same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Same address as the lady that spoke before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| I started a year ago working on this golf course proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| I knew it was coming up, and I had a dream, like Mr. Haslam stated in his inaugural address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5590)|
| 1:33:19| for the small businessman sitting at the kitchen table and wanting to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| Put the best golf course and the best facilities for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| that everybody that walked on that golf course at any time, either golf courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5613)|
| 1:33:43| could walk away and call their friend and say, man, they've done a great job out there, and let's go play golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| I wanted to make money for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| In my proposal, which was turned down, I was guaranteeing the city of Knoxville money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5636)|
| 1:34:06| In the history of golf course leasing, you have never, to my knowledge, made a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5646)|
| 1:34:19| That's a pretty big statement right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| But I was willing to guarantee you $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year, and I encounter the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5663)|
| 1:34:36| I pay the payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| I pay the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| I get the lease for the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| All I wanted from the city was it was your course, your facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| All I wanted you to do was meet me halfway on capital improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| because it is city property that we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| But that was my dream, and that dream was shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| And I'm here tonight to talk to you, and in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| this contract is not in the best interest of the citizens and the taxpayers of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5712)|
| 1:35:23| I'm talking to you now as a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| I'm talking to you as a golfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| I'm a member of that golf course, have been for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| I'm president of a golf association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| I'm tournament director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| I work there two or three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| I know what goes on at Knoxville Golf Course, and I've played many, many rounds at Whittles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| Now, as your contract, I mailed out to some of you people, and I might go over here just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| and I hope you'll indulge me and give me the additional time that I may need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| because we're talking about $5 million or $6 million here in the course of this contract, maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5755)|
| 1:36:05| I mailed each council member a study sheet to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| I hope you all got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| The next question I have for you, have you read the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5772)|
| 1:36:22| Have you read this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| I've got it marked to death, highlighted stuff in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| And I almost quote this contract from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| I took this contract for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| I took this contract to some friends of mine that are CPAs, accountants, bankers, whatever, knowledgeable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5801)|
| 1:36:51| They said, Read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Tell me what you think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| They said, their quote now, I'm quoting their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| They said, This is not a good contract for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| This is a sweet deal for Bill Casper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5826)|
| 1:37:15| Now, I'm going to highlight a few points here that I have made in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| and I want you to kind of give me your utmost attention that you have tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| because I really want this to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| In the working capital clause of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| you're going to pay Billy Casper in this contract that we're looking at tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| $9,500 a month for the working capital with a 3% increase each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5860)|
| 1:37:55| Now, in case you don't have a pencil in front of you, that's $114,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| That's $570,000 for the length of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| And then you put another five-year extension that they're asking for that can be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5886)|
| 1:38:15| That comes up to $1,140,000 with a 3% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5895)|
| 1:38:25| Now, I'm not trying to make a statement here that's going to annihilate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| and get your little collar raised up here a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| but you only gave city employees 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| You're giving them 3% to pay their employees, pay the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| and all the working capital of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| All you have to do is read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| It's all right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| That is five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Would somebody on the Council like to grant a session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Here's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Two more minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| They said Council granted you two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| I was looking at my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| Hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| My wife says hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| The next line in there, you're going to give Billy Casper's golf in this contract $6,000 for travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| Now, I stated in workshop that Billy Casper's worth $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| Eighty golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| But they've asked for $6,000 for travel to go back and forth to courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| If they want to fly to a convention or if they want to do this or they want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| you're going to pay them $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| You're going to furnish them airfare, automobiles, lodging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| That comes up to $60,000 in a ten-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| Now, the capital improvement part of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| I didn't write it down verbatim, but I'm going to try to quote from memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| without getting the contract out and read it right here, but it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| the city will be responsible for all capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=5997)|
| 1:40:06| That's everything you're going to spend on that golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| Of course, they have the clause up there, working capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| Now, get this and listen real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| There's a clause in that contract that says if they run out of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| and the funds get a little short, the city, which is the owner in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| will reimburse them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| Boys, girls, young lady, men, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| If I had this contract that you're going to try to approve tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| probably I don't want you to hold me too much to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| but I'd probably guarantee you $200,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| I was only willing to guarantee you $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| I'd rather give you $200,000 or $300,000 a year because it's all sitting money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| because they're paying all the bills out of the capital working fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| I could guarantee you $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Write you a check out of the capital working fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| It's your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| It's city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| There are some really discrepancies in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Thirty more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| I was fixing to sum up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| As the mayor has stated in his speeches and stuff about operating the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6091)|
| 1:41:41| as a concerned taxpayer and citizen that's not in the fight for the contract anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| let's do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| Let's do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| Let's turn this contract down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Let's vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| And let's do something that's in the best interest of the taxpayers and the goffers in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| I want to thank you again for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| If you have any questions for me, I'll be more than happy to try to answer them the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| Any comments or questions by Councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| Mayor, I'd like to ask Joe Walsh or Sam if they'd like to respond to some of the issues he's raised, Mr. Hatcher raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| Joe, maybe it wouldn't hurt just maybe a quick 20 seconds of how the process went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| how you came to, how the group came to make this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6155)|
| 1:42:43| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| The process we went through, we started back in July, did a request for a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| We knew that the Nassau Municipal Golf Course 25-year lease would be running out at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| So we started the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| We had a selection committee made up of six members who reviewed the proposal, the request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| We let that through the normal purchasing procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| It was out for about 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| We received, I believe, five proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| We had an evaluation team made up of, like I said, six members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| We reviewed those proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| We narrowed it down to three, which we interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| And the committee reviewed the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| We interviewed three firms, scored those, and came up with Billy Casper Golf as our number one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| And then we proceeded to negotiate an agreement with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| It took about two or three weeks with the help of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| And then we've reached the point we are now where we are ready to initiate that agreement and start the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6225)|
| 1:43:54| As far as some of the points that Mr. Hatcher has made, I think, first of all, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| we are totally comfortable with the decision that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| I think there was consensus amongst the group, and we think it's a very wise business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| We are, in fact, the owner and operator of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| We are basically letting a contract with Billy Casper Golf to manage and operate the golf course only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| It's our golf course at the end of the day, and we're basically paying them for their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| Like Mr. Hatcher indicated, they currently manage 80 golf courses across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| One of those golf courses is Little Springs Golf Course, which they've been operating this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| We've been very, very pleased with the process as they've been working with us day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| I think that was one of the great reasons that we chose Billy Casper Golf as our final contractor that we want to get approval on this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6282)|
| 1:44:54| Other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Was the proposal that went out, did it ask just for what's, in effect, a management contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| In effect, you know, we're going to pay the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| We want you to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Or was it a proposal for all types of operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| What Mr. Hatcher obviously proposed is very different from what Billy Casper proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| Was it open for all that, or was it specifically a management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| We specifically requested a firm to manage and operate the golf course for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| The major reason behind that, we've had Little Springs Golf Course back under our jurisdiction for the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6322)|
| 1:45:30| Also, Municipal Golf Course has been operated by the Roberts family for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| We really, frankly, don't have a lot of experience managing and operating golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| So we wanted to turn to somebody with the professional knowledge to help us operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| But because we don't have any really financial history primarily on either golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| we felt like it would be in our best interest to operate it and manage it and see how the numbers come in the first couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6353)|
| 1:46:02| I will point out that in this contract, at the end of the first year, we have the right to terminate the contract without reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| And that was an important stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| We felt like if, for whatever reason, after 12 months' history working with Billy Casper Golf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| if we're not pleased with how the golf course is being operated or we're not realizing the kind of revenue we think we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| then we have the option to negate the contract with 60-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| On this, the travel that was just mentioned, $6,000, what exactly is that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6391)|
| 1:46:39| I think that $6,000, that's up to $6,000, and it's not necessarily it will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| If Billy Casper has, if we ask him to come, say, for example, to address City Council and they have to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6405)|
| 1:46:53| then we've agreed to reimburse them for any expenses they may incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| I think this is a typical expense that you'll find in a lot of contracts of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| They do operate Centennial Golf Course already in Oak Ridge, and then they'll have three golf courses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6423)|
| 1:47:10| They'll be sending staff in from time to time, primarily at our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| And I think it's just to reimburse them for those type of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| So what kind of staff would be coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| I mean, they're going to have people here in Knoxville, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| Yeah, they'll be staffing both golf courses with a superintendent, with a manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| and they'll have a regional manager who will oversee those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| I'm assuming it would be, quite frankly, it's marketing individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| people with specialized abilities that we may individually request to come in and help us with a particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6466)|
| 1:47:53| But quite frankly, I don't anticipate this being utilized to any length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6473)|
| 1:48:02| Councilman Holquist, and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| Councilman Byler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Well, I had a question along the same lines, and I'm not sure if you've answered it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| If I remember correctly, in the evaluation matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| there are maybe a total of ten points that could be garnered by having what I think you call a local interest or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| And was it Hatcher or somebody got ten, and Casper got eight because they had an office here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6506)|
| 1:48:36| Right, because they had a presence here of some kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Three golf courses, including Centennial, and they were already at Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| And actually their regional manager for the whole southeast is currently living in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| Yeah, that's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| They had some significant management level individual here in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| So I had a real concern about that, too, about the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| To a certain degree, it seems like a cost of doing business, you know, rather than something that would be extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| And we had the same discussion with Billy Casper as we negotiated this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| There were several stipulations that were negotiated back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| I think they reassured us that the $6,000 would be there just to protect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| if the city had not also decided we needed them to come back every other week to do something special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| that they would not be incurring unusual expenses that wouldn't fall under normal operations that they've included in their management fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6573)|
| 1:49:42| Yeah, I guess my concern is if we pay them for, if they have regular management services on their part from a corporate level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| where they send someone in to check out what's going on at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| I mean, that's something any good company will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| They'll send in higher level management from corporate from time to time to check out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| And I just don't think we should be paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| And what I hear you saying is we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| And I just don't know how that's determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| Do they have to just submit something and somebody says, yeah, we think that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| or no, we're not going to pay that because we don't think that's appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| I would be glad to make it clear to Billy Casper Goff that if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| they decide that they're going to use this travel expense, they will want pre-authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| That way we can control the expenses to every degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| Yeah, that would make a lot of sense if that were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| But that would have to be in the contract, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| Mr. Kaiser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| I'm making notes in the margin right now, Mr. Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Joe and I will discuss that with Billy Casper tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| So if we were to approve this contract as it stands, as it's presented before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| you're saying you'd be in a position to make those additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| If for some reason we're not able to, I'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| But my anticipation is that that won't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Don't you feel the same way, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Yeah, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| So you're saying counsel would not have to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| No, I'm saying go ahead and approve it, and I will take that up with Casper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| And if for some reason that's objectionable to them to the point they refuse to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| we'll get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| But I don't anticipate a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| When you say get back with us, if we approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| based on that understanding and they don't agree to it, you'd come back to counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| I'm assuming you're approving it based on that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| I kind of think what they might be trying to say, or at least I'm trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| is a concern that they're going to use city of Knoxville taxpayer money to come in on travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| and then that will coincide with checking out a golf course that's not a city course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6711)|
| 1:51:59| I mean, we appreciate efficiencies, but we don't need to have the citizens pay for their efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6719)|
| 1:52:07| Double dipping is not the right term, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| I understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| And as they explained it when we asked them about that $6,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| they reiterated that it would just be travel outside of the ordinary at our request to have them come into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6737)|
| 1:52:26| Another thing, if you look at the specific language, it's on page 10 under subsection E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| It has to do with travel in connection with services approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| in a line item of the approved annual budget and program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| So if there's something that we want them to do that's made its way into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| and, again, the budget's the city's budget, then that's talking about that sort of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| That's, again, something within the city's control because, ultimately, the city controls the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| But, again, Mr. Chalk, I'll assume that council's approving it based upon a modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| that preauthorization in any event is required before an expenditure under subsection E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| And if there's a problem with that, which I don't anticipate, we'll get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6784)|
| 1:53:12| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Kizer, because that's one thing the golf course committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| and some of us insisted on that there be a lot of priority put on local potential management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6800)|
| 1:53:30| because the money stays here, people from around here, you know, benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| And they seem to me like they added in there that they're a local, they have a local officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| they have local management here, yet, you know, they throw in this $6,000 to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6822)|
| 1:53:49| Well, if they're already here, why do they have to have any travel money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| And go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| They do have a large local presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| This kind of plates the way on up their level management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| But the intent of that local interest is to get local people that are already here to make the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| to work here, and, you know, to benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| So, you know, that's something we really need to watch because that's a little tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| And I noticed that during the workshop and well before Mr. Hatcher brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| That's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| And I just want to say that when I look at this as a council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| and someone that served on the golf course committee, on one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| I'm looking at the taxpayer and the constituent and the golfer in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| and the facility itself and how we utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| On the other hand, I do have to respect the administration and the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| And so Mr. Hatcher, who I've known growing up in sports, he's refereed basketball and football around here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| You're a real legend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| You're in the Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| You're well respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| And I say this to you in all seriousness because I went out there and I toured that golf course with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| and I've heard you and I know your heart and soul is in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| And I know you're, you know, just to be around you, to listen to you talk about your willingness to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| it's really contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| And, you know, your interest and excitement, you know, I felt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| But on the other hand, as I said, I really do have to respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| And as Mr. Walsh said earlier and we've heard numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| that if we're not satisfied with Billy Casper in a year, that's the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| And I'm going to be paying close attention, as I know the golf course committee members are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| and they're going to be involved in an oversight process to make sure that we get those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| that tutoring, that teaching, those youth camps, the programs for seniors that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| because this is the only shot that this council has at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| And so the way this contract is set up, you know, we can look at this and we can review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| But I just want to say that, you know, that, Mr. Hatcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| your effort here has really enhanced the program and the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| And so I'll just continue to listen to what other council members have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| and then I'm going to vote the way I think I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| Yeah, Mr. Walsh, kind of backing up a step, trying to look at the picture a little more globally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6978)|
| 1:56:28| I'm not sure if I've gotten accurate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| because this is just bits and pieces that I think I recall hearing here and there in the past little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6990)|
| 1:56:37| not necessarily related to this contract or these courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| But is it true that the number of golfers is not increasing overall in the population as far as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7000)|
| 1:56:52| or do you know anything about the demographics of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| To my knowledge, and I'm not an avid golfer, I might ask Mr. Anderson to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| but what I've been led to believe through people I've talked to is golf is pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| It's not a growing sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| It is leveled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| In fact, actually it's doing better than it was five or six years ago when a lot of golf courses were closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| because participation was down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| But I think it's now recovered and it's now heading back in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| Okay, I'm trying to get a sense of the supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| I think I'd heard that, again, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| it's sort of plateaued in terms of the number of golfers, the demand, and, you know, the amount of usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| And I know there's some terminology for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| Not being a golfer, I don't know all that terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| You know, some people here know it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| But just from the sense of supply and demand in our local market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| and I'm not talking about just municipal courses, I'm talking about all courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| that are open to generally anybody that wants to either pay a fee per game or, you know, maybe clubs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| I don't know, but just in the general market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| Is it a buyer's market if you're a golfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| Councilman Holcomb, I'm probably better able to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| It's not necessarily a buyer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| The high-end golf courses are doing well because it's prepaid golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| It's like a timeshare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| You know, you go out and join a club, pay for the golf, whether you play or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| Public golf courses through the week, seniors, children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| And you have to make public golf courses have good golf courses, provide a good, clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| wholesome atmosphere at a price that people on Social Security and fixed income can afford to play during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| On weekends, sometimes you can raise the prices because that's when the weekend golfers come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7118)|
| 1:58:43| and they're only playing once a week and they don't mind paying a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| And public golf courses, you really have to look at who are the regulars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| And the regulars are senior citizens and most of the senior citizens that live in this community inside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| that are our constituents, our own fixed incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| and we have to provide a very reasonable golf opportunity for them or their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| And golf will not grow unless you make it affordable to the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| and that's what Councilman Bailey was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| We have to have youth programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| We have to have discounts for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| We've got to have all kinds of situations, certain days that you play for a little bit less in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| And we're going to put all those kind of things into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| And then, again, it's hard to put all the things that we're requesting into a budget and then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7168)|
| 1:59:36| but we want $200,000 at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| There's got to be some kind of balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| And our balance has got to be service to the community and quality of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| But golf is flat because over the last 10 years, there has not been very good youth golf programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| First Tee and some programs now are generating that, but over the last 10 to 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| there's just not been much to offer, for lack of a better term, for blue-collar golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| The guy that works every day and wants to take his kids out and play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| or her children out and play golf once a week or something like that, or learn to play a game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| there's no free place to play like it is with baseball and basketball and tennis and other sports, soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| I guess some people have the perception of golf courses perhaps being a holding use for valuable real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7221)|
| 2:00:30| with the anticipation of at some point that real estate will be converted to another use, you know, as far as development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| And, you know, what you're saying helps me to kind of get a better picture of the role that it plays in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7237)|
| 2:00:44| So I appreciate that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| Motion and a second on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| Mr. Hatcher wanted to follow up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| I think we ought to just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| I'm going to give you some city figures over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| This is your figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| This is not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| Last year, Billy Casper operated Willow Springs Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| As their report and the city report, as of June 07, $144,000 lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7280)|
| 2:01:30| That's with the city paying the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| And they also paid the manager $60,000 a year to run it for him for Billy Casper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| They paid all the bills there, and you still lost $144,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| That's your figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Now, there's two other figures I want to give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| Willow Springs averages around 25,000 golfers a year when it's in good condition and up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7309)|
| 2:01:57| Knoxville Golf Course is running around 25,000 to 30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7317)|
| 2:02:03| Multiply those, put them together, that would be about 50-55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| That would be the number of rounds it would play at $25 a round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| Now, I want to make sure, as taxpayer here, that the city gets a good deal here and gets your money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| In the clause, it says if everywhere, if, if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| Now, if you put a pencil to that, that's $1,250,000 a year that these golf courses are supposed to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| If you multiply that by five, that's $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| If you multiply it by ten, and after those four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| you're not going to have to put so much money in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| You're going to be making more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| I just want to make sure that the taxpayers and everything, you get your money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| that we get it back so we can use it for other services, for basketball or whatever is needed in recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| That's all I'm concerned about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| And those are some figures that are true figures that you need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| And make sure that golf advisory and people, you stay on top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| and you make sure you're getting your money's worth out of these golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7395)|

| 2:04:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| I was just going to say, you know, for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| let's try to increase the number of dogwoods we're planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7449)|

| 2:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Yeah, I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| I'll say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| I'm always concerned about sort of the long-term maintenance costs if we're creating alleys that we're having a lot of traffic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| I just was going to ask if maybe for the next budget the administration could get some idea of what we're looking at long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7505)|
| 2:05:14| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| We tried to talk about that a little bit before, but that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| We didn't vote on that, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| I guess Mr. King would speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| Based on the maps that are supplied with this document, these are all the alleys covered under this particular item are in one part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7528)|
| 2:05:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Is that because that's where all the unpaved gravel alleys are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| I was thinking there were some others in other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| No, there are others in several parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| With this new program and coordinating with public service, since they're going to be doing the prep work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7556)|
| 2:06:02| we decided that it would be best to start in one location and move it around year by year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| like we do our citywide paving program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| spreading the small amount of work that we could do with this contract across the councilmanic districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| So do you have a schedule, a multiyear schedule, that shows where you're going to go year to year yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| So how did you determine, without looking at all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| and figuring out how you're going to schedule over a period of time, how did you determine one year's schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| We chose an area where we felt like there was a need for paved alleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7597)|
| 2:06:44| because we're requiring in these overlay zones the redevelopment to come out into the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| As you may recall during our budget discussions, that was the reason that we started this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| So we're trying to address where we feel those need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| I know that's not all the need at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| but we're trying to address where we feel like the biggest need is at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| So all of these alleys that are indicated here are within overlay zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| No, not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| But there are a portion of them within an overlay zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| and when we made the decision that that was a key point of that kind of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| we put additional gravel alleys that we felt like needed to be paved because they were in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7643)|
| 2:07:31| They're, again, working toward doing this work in one area of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| rather than spreading a small alley paving program citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| I guess to me it would be helpful as a council member if, and I know this is asking a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7662)|
| 2:07:50| and I'm not saying that the vote tonight should be contingent on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| You know, I hear what you're saying, and I think we've got to move ahead on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| But I think in the future, let's say before next year's alley paving comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| before that ordinance and that program for the year comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| it would be great if there was some kind of, and I understand these things are subject to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| but if there is a sort of a tentative multiyear plan that council could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| and see, well, this is where we're going and this is what we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| and this is why you see where I'm going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| Seeing no further lights, ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7711)|

| 2:08:53| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim due to Knox Housing Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7733)|

| 2:09:02| within the city limits of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| pursuant to the homemaker program for a contract sales price of $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Ms. Rojero, can you, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| but just real briefly could you tell us what this is about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| I've got a good idea what it's about, but just give me a thumbnail sketch of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| About October of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| a council approved our acquiring these blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| One of them had been certified blighted for about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| They both were certified blighted, and so we purchased them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| We put them out in the, as typical as part of the homemaker's program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| we advertised them in the homemaker's program for six months, the first part of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7791)|
| 2:09:58| and we had one applicant during that six-month period, and that was Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| This is in accordance with the homemaker's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| which identifies that it is appropriate to sell the property below fair market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7809)|
| 2:10:18| if it is going to benefit low to moderate income homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| if the development costs will exceed the fair market value of the completed project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| and if the property has been owned by the city and posted for at least 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| and there are no other offers and several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| So this clearly meets the original goals of the homemaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| Also, we're real excited about these two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| The two on Houston Street, along with five properties on Chestnut Street, will all be developed by KHP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7842)|
| 2:10:52| and they have recently received development loans from the EZ Blighted Properties Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| And they're seven of our first eight loans that were approved by the EZ Blighted Property Program Loan Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| And these two lots, along with those five on Chestnut, are going to be both visitable and they are going to be green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| They're actually going to be LEED-certified silver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| That's our goal. That's KHP's goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| And we're real excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| We think these will be the first, maybe the first houses in Knoxville that are LEED-certified, the first residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| and these are going to be marketed to low- to mod-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| So we're real excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| And this is the EZ Blighted Property funding or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| Well, the EZ Blighted Property Program is providing the development loan for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| You know, a portion of that will be paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| We're also putting some home dollars in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| So we're real excited. It's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7909)|

| 2:12:17| Don was here. I think he had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Well, I know he was very excited about this, and I thought perhaps I can't see at that end of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| I just wanted him to comment on it because he was very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| I will say our ICAC, Internet Crimes Against Children group at KPD, does an incredible job in a horrible line of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7951)|
| 2:12:41| Nobody wants to have to deal with what those guys have to look at and women, but they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7969)|

| 2:13:02| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7986)|

| 2:13:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 07-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| Just real quick, and I don't want to talk as much as you want or not, but this is actually good news for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=7995)|
| 2:13:23| One, our revenue was above what we projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| A lot of that, quite frankly, out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| Our portion of what we received out of the Hall income tax really more than doubled from about 3.2 million last year to 7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8010)|
| 2:13:37| We really don't have any way of knowing that until we get those numbers, which we got in July 31st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| So, back when we were budgeting this, we had no clue we would be so fortunate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| And then, quite frankly, we did pretty well in other sources of revenue with business tax and license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| and then the increase that we see off of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| And then the other thing is a tip of the hat to our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| They all did a great job of controlling their budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| So, when everybody's budget comes in underneath, we're going to do well overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| So, when we did that, we had really three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| One, just ignore the surplus we had, leave it in the bank, so to speak, and build a bigger bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| Second, we could wait and, you know, do everything as a part of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| when we came to you with a budget proposal this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| Or third, we could say, you know, we have real needs where we can spend this money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| It's either pay me now or pay me more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| And or things that are pay me now and save money later on things, whether it be the pension fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| which is underfunded, or replacing the lights in our signalization with LED lights, which will save us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8075)|
| 2:14:41| It will really pay back in about two and a half years or much needed, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| with the sidewalk program or paving, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| So, obviously, you could have some questions about the certain things that we pick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| but we try to pick those things, like I said, where either we had to do them sooner or later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| and two, they were going to actually save us money and make operating budgets down the road be easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| for this council and other councils in the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| So that was our operating kind of mentality, and we'll be glad to take any questions from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| You know, and I'm glad to see that we're doing a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| I just wanted to ask for just a quick understanding explanation with regards to the $110,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| for the additional planning and management of the Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| Exactly what would that be spent on and who is that going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Is that something going to an existing organization for doing that work, or where is that dollars going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| And it says planning and management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| I'll let Dr. Lyons comment on that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| The money is going to go really for two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| The majority of it will be actually returned in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| We're going to hire a person that we're sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| The cost is shared among the city, University of Tennessee, and Covenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| because all three entities have an interest in Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| Covenant being Fort Sanders Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Fort Sanders Hospital, so that we will be getting a good bit of that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| We'll be getting about $50,000 of that back later, though we have to incur the cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8168)|
| 2:16:13| That employee will be a city employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| We will recover two-thirds of the expense of that employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| and that also gets us going on some of the contract work to be doing some parking studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| and traffic studies and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| But the majority of this will go to a person who will be primarily working on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| They'll be housed here at the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| They'll be housed in the city in our department, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| Do we have an end time on when we think we're going to get these reports from this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| Well, we look to be hiring this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Everything is set to go ahead and proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| We look to be hiring this person within a number of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| and then we would put that person on the ground working on this, coordinating with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| and developing the small area plan that's going to be a form-based zoning approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| and then working to coordinate a lot of the work on the ground, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| literally and figuratively beyond Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| So that work will begin shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| It will be starting the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| We have to do a lot of work in planning the specific road changes that will have to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| utility changes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| But that person will be at work soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| I mean, that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| I know we had the other study that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| I think, and I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| I didn't have to specifically deal with Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| Every once in a while I get just a little concerned when we crank out reports that at the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| it's going to call for an expenditure of a large sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| We've got to spend a large sum of money to make sure that we get the South Knox waterfront going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| And I think within the lifetime of this council, at least my time over the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| and I guess the four years for some other folks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| from what I heard about the Cumberland Avenue project, it sounds like it's very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| but it's going to be a very large commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| And as we make these steps of doing these types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| I think we send out a message that somewhere down the line we're going to bite that apple for a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| expenditure to make some things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| So I think we just need to be real clear on one step leads to another a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| We just need to make sure we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| And somebody's going to have expectations that this is not going to be a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| or a process that's going to sit on the wall, that it's not going to come to this council and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| well, great plan, but we don't have, you know, 15, 20, 30, 40 million dollars to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| So we just need to be very aware of, you know, that's the kind of direction we're kind of going with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| And I do see this person really as moving into the implementation stage of the study that's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| And we have a lot of good bit of the funding falling in place, too, from TDOT and other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| And that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| There's a lot of good work done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| And the proposals look really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| And the end result looks very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| Getting from here to there from an expenditure point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| especially in light of what's in front of us from South Waterfront kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| brings that specter of how deep is our pool of money to make a lot of these things happen fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| And I'll come to you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| And, Mark, it's a great point, and we've talked about that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| I think we'd be a little less willing to go into this if we didn't have willing partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| quite frankly, in the university, in the hospital, in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| And also in TDOT, the commissioner of transportation was over last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| and they're pretty excited about this project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| But your point is a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| I mean, at some point in time, you dive off the big board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| And my points come from just a history of seeing areas like Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, Five Points, even Vestal area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8361)|
| 2:19:30| I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| I don't represent that area or Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| But there's been a lot of plans over the years in those areas that kind of set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| and there was a lot of frustration, disappointment on the part of folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| It's not because there wasn't a will from an elected body to want to do something, but the funds weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| So we have to just be very careful about the kind of things we start getting going down the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| and what the expectation is going to be from those folk who are directly impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| such as those folk who live in the Cumberland Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| Mayor, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| And to follow up on that, Vice Mayor, I would agree with what the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| And what Mr. Lyons said, this is, your point is well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| You know, this is leading us towards a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| But as the mayor said, the partners at the table here are major partners, the largest and best university in the state, hands down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8413)|
| 2:20:26| You know, this is their front door, and they know that something's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| And Covenant Health, Fort Sanders Regional Hospital and Children's Hospital, they know that change is needed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8431)|
| 2:20:38| And so these are partners that are willing to step up on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| And what this says is we're bought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| You know, we're part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| And UT is already talking about, you know, they haven't made any hard commitments that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| but I know that they're willing to be partners throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| And again, as the mayor said, Commissioner Nicely, TDOT, you know, they're going to invest significantly in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| So this is low-hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| And one of the things I neglected to mention, and I apologize, during council reports, on tomorrow at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8464)|
| 2:21:13| the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Advisory Committee meets at Laurel Theater, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8473)|
| 2:21:20| And that's the first time that the committee's met in several months because there hasn't been any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| there hasn't been any activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| But the committee's meeting because we're going to be talking about these very things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| You know, all the partners and anybody else that's interested, including, of course, any council members that are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| certainly hope would come, but we really are beginning to gear up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| And it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| And having this person on board is going to make a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| Commissioner Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| Well, I just would call to kind of follow up on what I said on the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8509)|
| 2:22:10| that it was going to be a period of time before we anticipated actually seeing something happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8530)|
| 2:22:17| that this was just simply a visionary planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| Now, does this change our timeline in any way in the administration's plans, or can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8541)|
| 2:22:31| Well, the actual road changes in the road, which are key to this, can happen for a couple of years anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| because TDOT is committed to finishing Smart Fix 40 before doing anything that will affect traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| But a lot can be done in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| A lot of the things that are holding back Cumberland have to do with the land use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| and requirements for setbacks, many of the same things we talked about in the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| And we're fortunate, having gone through that experience, and MPC having gone through that experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| we feel that we'll be able to develop that code a lot more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| And that will be enough in itself to be giving people who own the land and want to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| you know, they don't have to necessarily wait for that road to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| A lot of the engineering work and the planning work and the land use work will begin soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| And this should be, and it's a much more finite piece of land than we're talking about when we're talking about South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| And also we have every indication that the return on this and taxes and what can happen on Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| as many of you have followed some of the media reports, it's the economics of Cumberland haven't been the best lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8608)|
| 2:23:35| And I think a lot of people are expecting that we need a new approach and new set of infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| both legally and also physically, to let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| Councilman Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| Mr. Donaldson, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| I believe you told me that the rezoning, hopefully form-based code rezoning for Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| is in the current fiscal year's work plan for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| Meeting tomorrow afternoon, reconvening the advisory committee will kick off the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8643)|
| 2:24:10| where we turn that plan into a codified form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8650)|
| 2:24:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8658)|

| 2:27:46| Dr. Mathis, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8866)|
| 2:28:04| Dr. Mathis, if you could give us your name and address and then you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| I thought everybody knew me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| My name is Charles W. Mathis, and I live at 2520 Baldrige Pike just on the edge of Empowerment Zone in Eastern Oxford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8888)|
| 2:28:16| And I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that Eastern Oxford is not a very fun place to live at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| Orange barrels, construction trucks, dump trucks, KB trucks, it's constantly going all over four major streets in Eastern Oxford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8903)|
| 2:28:37| And it's Castle, Lay, Sunset, Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| And I've lived there for almost 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| And when I get in my car and get ready to go out to maybe buy some food or something, I've got to pick my way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| But I said it to say it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| My primary concern was to talk about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8936)|
| 2:29:03| On Resolution 11A and H, I see where you spent $519 and $508.30 for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8943)|
| 2:29:18| How much is that going to Eastern Oxford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| A lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| A lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Speak up, Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| You said a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| A good bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| A good bit of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| And I'll let you see the resolution afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| And the other one you're talking about with regards to alleys, all of that's in Eastern Oxford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| Well, since I waited all this long, I'm going to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8976)|
| 2:29:42| Here's another resolution authorizing the mayor to execute with due cap S or company inch for 2008 added paving project to the amount of $137,000, $381.68 for paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=8982)|
| 2:30:00| How much is that for Wilson Avenue, for instance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| Now, being I say that, KUB has come out there, and they're replacing all the black pipes with PCP pipes in all those homes out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9003)|
| 2:30:15| And every time they leave, they patch it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| And when I drive down the street in my F-150, it's bump to the bump, bump to the bump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9018)|
| 2:30:25| That's nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| Well, and then my last part of my last part is about the Alex Haley Historic Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9028)|
| 2:30:39| Ladies and gentlemen, that's a disgrace square for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| It's run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| The construction that was done there years ago is not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| The monkey grass is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| It's wilted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| The trees are dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| The way that the statue is turned, it's turned the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| It's pointing towards Seymour Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| To my knowledge, he was born in Hennings, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| That's a little town between Memphis and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| And if I'm not mistaken, there's supposed to be a pond there because he's reading a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| And seated in front of him is some kids, and there's a pond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| The pond signifies the Atlantic Ocean and the African coast, which means that the people of African-American descent were yearning to find out their heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9086)|
| 2:31:39| Nothing there now but a bunch of huge boulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| Now, there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| The reason for that is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| Yvonne Easley, she had $10,000 to raise enough money to bring that statue back to Knoxville when it was finished and place it on the site where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9106)|
| 2:32:01| But what happened was the statue was too big to put on an 18-wheeler track to take all over the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9121)|
| 2:32:09| So what Alexandria did, it affected the whole United States, not just the South, but all the African-Americans living in the fourth section of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9129)|
| 2:32:18| Anyway, when the statue was finished, it stayed up there in, I believe, New York City, and it ran for a bill of $92,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9138)|
| 2:32:30| And then I think the city probably paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| But they raised the flag on Miss Easley, and I'm not raising the flag on this city council because this city council didn't exist then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9153)|
| 2:32:43| But it goes back maybe to Mr. Kessler, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| But I'm raising a red flag on that whole site because it's actually a disgrace to the city of Knoxville, especially when you leave Gate Street and come back down to Central Avenue and right between TBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9168)|
| 2:33:03| It's beautiful this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| But the minute you come back down to Central Avenue and cross Central Avenue and come over at the Wiser, it looks just like Iraq over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9185)|
| 2:33:14| Dark, no lights, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| Nothing left to add to say that this is Christmas time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| With that being said, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071204?start=9203)|
