| 0:00:29| Hey, let's get started. Welcome everyone to the July Planning Commission Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=29)|
| 0:00:38| We have a new commissioner this month, Miles Biggs. So we welcome you, Miles. I've known Miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=38)|
| 0:00:45| for a good many years. Reflective of my age, he graduated with my daughter in high school. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:54| he's a very talented young man. I know he will make some really good contributions to the overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| group here. And Miles, if you want to say a hello and a word, you're invited to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| Sure. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, everybody. Excited to be here. Yeah, I know there's a full agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| so a little bit of baptism by fire. But yeah, thanks for helping me get up to speed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| kind of learning the ropes. But excited to contribute to the group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Thank you. This time, I'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me? Okay. All right. Give a few updates on what staff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:34| been working on. Advanced Knox is continuing to move ahead towards the adoption process. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| project team has been working with a consultant on the draft plan and continuing to refine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| future land use map. And so we are excited to be compiling this information, and we'll be sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| it out with you very soon in the coming months. So stay tuned for more on that. The TPO Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| Board adopted the Regional Roadway Safety Action Plan at the end of June. This plan will position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| the region to apply for federal funding, and it identifies changes that can be made right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| to save lives and prevent serious injuries on our roadways. And the full plan is available at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| the knoxtpo.org backslash safety, if you're interested in taking a look at that. The search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| for replacement for our current Transportation Planning Manager is currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| I'm sad to say Jeff Welch is retiring in less than 40 days, so we hope to begin reviewing candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| by the end of this month. We renewed our contract for services with the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| continuing our work to provide design consultation as well as GIS mapping tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| for the business part segment of the Chamber website. And we are continuing to share the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| talents and skills of our web and GIS team with the Development Corporation. We've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| with the Chamber for several years to help them continue to build out their economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| and industrial recruitment devices to investment prospects nationally and internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| That's all I have for updates. I'm going to turn it over now if Aubrey is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| She's going to give a presentation on the 2022 Development Activity Report, which you have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| front of you. And I also just want to make note that we as we presented last month on the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| report, but you now have a printed copy of the basically all the information that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| to you last month. All right, I'll turn it over to Aubrey. Thanks, Amy. For the new commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| I'm Aubrey Weiland. I come up here to teach you guys about all the different development trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| and population trends. I'm typically the data person, so you get used to seeing me around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| Today I'm going to talk to you about the 2022 Development Activity Report. This is an annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| updated report on multiple indicators related to development in Knox County throughout the 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| calendar year. We produce an update on this report every spring, and we have been doing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| since the 80s. These annual updates allow us to track trends as they arise and keep an eye on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| what specific changes are coming to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| So to start off, these are the three sources that we use to discuss development in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:39| We use building permits, rezonings, and subdivisions. Rezonings and subdivisions are handled by planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| and building permits come to us from the county, city, and town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Building permits tell us what is being built and completed right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| whereas rezonings and subdivisions give us an idea of what is coming in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| Some general trends for 2022. Everything was higher in 2022 than 2018, except for new lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| from non-residential subdivisions, and acres rezoned for residential uses, and new lots from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| residential subdivisions were both only slightly higher than in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=312)|
| 0:05:28| While I talk about this report, I'm going to reference the 12 planning sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Here are some things that I anticipate when I get this data every year, and some things from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| that locals have probably come to expect. So let's keep them in mind during this presentation and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| if those expectations were met at the end of the presentation. Northwest County is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:59| the most of a lot of things. They've been at the top for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Southwest County is also going to get an honorable mention, sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| mostly in residential development. These two sometimes switch places at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| All the other county sectors will have some new neighborhoods, but overall they won't get as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| development as those that I just mentioned, and Central City has been trending upwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| after a huge loss in population in the previous decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| Both residential and non-residential permits were up from 2018. Southwest County actually had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| highest with 1,062 new units, just barely beating Northwest County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:48| Like I said, Southwest and Northwest County sometimes take turns in the lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| and South City was the lowest with those 35 new units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| Most of the permits were for residential units, so we see pretty much the same pattern looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| only residential units. We report residential units in four types of structure. Single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| detached, multi-family, mobile homes, and single-family attached. One trend that's cropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| up in recent years is a surge in multi-family housing, including outside Knoxville city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| which is not the case a decade ago, either before or after the Great Recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| In 2022, there were more multi-family units permitted than single-family detached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| Pictured are the Lakemore Station Apartments, which recently got a spotlight in the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| because UT just made a deal with them to claim all 240 units for student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:48| Northwest County had the most non-residential new developments at 41, with a near equal mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| of commercial, industrial, and institutional uses. South City, once again, had the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| And this photo isn't actually a building activity photo because it was a renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| but it is exciting to see the progress being done at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:13| In this residential building activity map, you can see that a lot of the smaller developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| are around the city core, and a lot of larger developments are mostly in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| However, there are a few larger clusters in the city that could be apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| And the northwest and southwest county sectors visibly have the most of the larger developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:39| We'd like to take a look at 10-year trends in this report. This one is all the new units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| permitted in the county in the past 10 years, split into residential and non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| From 2013 to 2022, northwest county alone gained about 8,500 new residential units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| which is the highest of all the sectors. And that's more than a quarter of all the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| residential units in the county in that same time period, which is only about 31,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| The next highest was southwest county, which was significantly lower at about 6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=543)|
| 0:09:12| In that same time period, northwest county had the most residential units in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| and that same time period, a five-year moving average reveals an upward trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| For this analysis, the five-year trend was the four years preceding the year in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:31| Moving on to the value of all this construction, I think we're all pretty aware that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| got very expensive in the past two years, and construction was certainly not excluded from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| In 2022, $1.1 billion were spent on new construction alone in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| and compared to renovations, they spent about $350 million on major renovations. I say major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| because we read a lot of news saying that everyone's going to be renovating their houses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| 2022 because they couldn't afford to move. If that happened, it wasn't the kind of major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| renovations that you need a permit for, like a complete bathroom remodel or an addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| and we don't get numbers on how many people painted their houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| but we can see that it was at least more expensive to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| Both residential and non-residential rezoning acreage was up from 2018. However, residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| rezonings were less significant. The acreage of all rezonings was highest in northwest county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| and it was lowest in the west city. The total number of rezonings was also highest in northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| county and lowest in the west city, or lowest also in the south city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| Interestingly, the acres of agricultural zone land converted by rezoning was lower than it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| had been in a few years in the past decade. Agriculturally zoned land is commonly rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| for detached single-family housing, so we keep an eye on that. Residential subdivisions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:05| up from 2018, but non-residential are way down. For context, the highest number of new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| lots created by non-residential subdivisions in the past 10 years was 74 lots, and that was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| 2016. New lots created is used in our new school enrollment projection model, and the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| uses the development activity report to prepare for future student enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| Northwest county also had the most subdivisions and the most lots created by those subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| And finally, you can also see that the most subdivisions are in the northwest and southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| county sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| So we could talk about whether those local expectations were met. Northwest county obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| was a star of pretty much every chart that I showed, and we also had a lot of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| shown. Southwest county had the most new units, so it deserves that honorable mention, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| it didn't really stand out in the rezonings or subdivisions. All the other county sectors did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| stand out over the city sectors. They are larger in land area, so that does make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| And finally, central city did stand out in new units permitted and in rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| And that's the last of my presentation. If there are any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=738)|

| 0:12:52| All right. Hi, I'm Jesse Hillman, principal planner for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:13:12| First item is agenda item number five, case 6E23RZ. This is a 0.67 acre property on Chickamauga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:22| Avenue, which is a local street. The rezoning request is to go from RN2, single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| neighborhood, to RN4, general residential neighborhood, and the infill housing overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| would be retained. The property is within the boundaries of the Oakwood Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| Neighborhood Association. It's located east of 275 and south of Sharps Ridge Veterans Memorial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| This property is in an area that's predominantly RN2, though it is adjacent to an RN5 zoned parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| to the east with six units. There are also two RN5 apartment communities nearby to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=835)|
| 0:14:05| The land use classification is traditional neighborhood development, which permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| consideration of RN4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And this is the aerial where you can see there's an existing single family dwelling on this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| that is now large. There's a plat that's in process that combined these two lots into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:28| The Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Plan adopted in 2006 describes how apartments should be designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| in similar proportions to the existing apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| This sentiment is reflected in the infill housing overlay that was added for this area in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| which describes how multi-unit housing should maintain the architectural scale, massing, and rhythm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| of the block and locate parking in the rear. So that does provide protections in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| neighborhood character. This open property is in an area, so it's in an area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| neighborhood character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| This open property is in an area, so we are recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| This open property is in an area where there is precedent for multi-family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Should such development occur, it would be assessed by the design review board for compatibility with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| the surrounding neighborhood character. This property is located near two cat bus stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| and the pending cat reimagined bus routes do show access being maintained here and potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| increased with a bus line going through this section of Chickamauga. It's also near the Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=932)|

| 0:15:43| So for these reasons, we are recommending approval. I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| Moving on to item number nine, 7D23RZ, 7A23PA, 7A23SP. This is a city rezoning and plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:16:04| It's a 1.11 acre parcel on Chapman Highway, a major arterial street. The request is to go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| RN1, a single family residential neighborhood with low density residential land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| to CH2, highway commercial with general commercial land use classification. The southeast portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| of this parcel is within the hillside protection overlay and this would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| The property is adjacent to RN1 zoning with a single family dwelling directly to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| There is a county agricultural and general residential zoning to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| separated by a right-of-way remnant from the old Smoky Mountain Railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| The requested CH2 zoning does exist nearby to the west and along Chapman Highway along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:59| However, you can see with the existing land use that much of that CH2 zoning is vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| or has a less intensive use on it. The residential area to the west and south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| is predominantly a single family residential or rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| The sector plan and the one-year plan, what we're seeing is the sector plan but the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| classifications are the same. They consistently classify this southern part of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| as low density residential to guide future land use. So general commercial would be a spot here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| on this side of Chapman. And in this aerial you can see that this is a forested parcel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| 2,000 square feet of the southeast portion of it has a slope of 25% or greater. The property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| located on a significant bend of Chapman Highway where there is no median turn lane or shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| on the south side. This intensive zoning request, so we're recommending denial of the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:18:03| and zoning. This intensive zoning request is not compatible with the adjacent low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| residential environment. Although there is significant CH2 zoning in this area, much of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| is vacant or does not meet its design capacity like the big box retail center to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| So these conditions don't warrant an expansion of commercial zoning to this location. This property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| is also located at a significant curve of Chapman Highway which could make adequate site distance a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| challenge. The Chapman Highway corridor study recommends adding turn lanes, median, and shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| as needed and these kinds of improvements have not occurred here nor are there known plans to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| Commercial zoning would likely increase the frequency of turning traffic which could be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| safety issue here. Office zoning was discussed with the applicant as a potential alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| but retail uses were being considered here which is not permitted in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| So I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| Okay. Item number 16, 7P23RZ, 7C23PA, 7D23SP. This is a city rezoning and plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:14| It's a 4.88 acre parcel on Lowness Drive, a major collector street north of I-40. The request is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| go from RN1 single family residential neighborhood with the LDR low density residential land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| classification to RN3 general residential neighborhood with an, I'm sorry, pardon that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| to MDR which is medium density residential land use classification not low. The rear portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| this parcel is in the hillside protection overlay which would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| This is an area with a wide range of residential zoning districts from RN1 to RN6. There is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| expansive apartment development zoned RN5 adjacent to the west and a single family RN1 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| adjacent to the east. The land use classification is LDR and the MDR classification is neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1201)|
| 0:20:10| the parcel to the west and south. This is a large wooded parcel with a single family home on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| currently. The existing land use is classified as rural residential which is an outlier in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| with more intensive residential densities surrounding. The rear 1.91 acres of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| are within the hillside protection area and the slope analysis provides a disturbance budget of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| 1.11 acres. As you can see there are a wide range of housing forms provided in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| from apartments to townhomes to single family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| We're recommending approval of RN3 and MDR. It provides a transition of residential intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| from the RN5 district to the west to the RN1 district to the east and there is RN3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| directly across Lonas Drive. Consideration of more residential density here is also supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| by the property's close proximity to job centers in the form of several medical office parks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| the south as well as schools like Pond Gap Elementary and South College to the south and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| east respectively. So for these reasons we're recommending approval. Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| I've got a quick question. So if RN3 were to allow townhomes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:33| could the townhomes be oriented to go long ways? Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| If it was on a shared lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| yes. So then the rear setback would be the west, the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:54| then if they oriented them that way? Let me pull up the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:22:03| So you're asking if the orientation was faced internally? Yeah. Kind of like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| courtyard type setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| And so the rear setbacks would then apply along the sides? I think it's how close would those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| townhomes be to theoretical townhomes be to that single family residential neighborhood to the east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1342)|
| 0:22:33| Yeah I think the way this has been interpreted in the past is that you would look at one giant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| so the front lot line is along Lowness. The rear lot line is parallel to that for this back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| the side lot lines are perpendicular to Lowness. Okay. So then they couldn't orient it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| townhomes going down the lot, the long way of that lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Or they could. They could, yeah. If they put them on lots then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:23:08| if each townhouse is on its own individual lot then the rear setback for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| individuals would still be I guess to the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you, Jesse. As this gets transitioned over to Michelle, I just want to make a note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| item number 30 the applicant has submitted a request of withdrawal. So unless the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| would like to review it we will just move on to item number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Okay so this is a request to apply for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:49| So this is a request to rezone a portion of the subject property from PR up to 12 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:24:06| units an acre to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1446)|

| 0:24:13| This parcel has dual zoning with the main body of the parcel zoned CA and both a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1453)|

| 0:24:32| The surrounding area does include retail and business and services, so this zone is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| The rest of the parcel's frontage is already zoned CA, so approval of this request would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| make the front of the property consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| This area does have a history of rezonings to commercial zones since the late 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| particularly at this corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1491)|

| 0:25:26| According to the plan, survey results stemming from the public participation process revealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| that the majority of the people would support office development on Asheville Highway and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| the majority of the people would support commercial uses on all major streets except Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1536)|

| 0:25:44| Looking at the existing use of the land, you can see the corner contains commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| In general, Asheville Highway is a mix of commercial, office, institutional, and undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| land with single family neighborhoods off of side streets for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Looking at street view, you can see Asheville Highway is a pretty heavily traveled road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| It's classified as a major arterial, so it's designed to handle heavy traffic and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| a divided highway, so it's well suited for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| The aerial map shows that there is a neighborhood located to the rear of the property and across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Neal's Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| There is a creek that runs along this northern property line here that divides the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| parcel, including the area to be rezoned from that single family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| Looking south, you can see Food City is across the street and some other commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| And then considering that, looking at the general plan, there's some policies recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| locating community-serving commercial areas where they can be easily shared by several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| neighborhoods and the surrounding neighborhood of the properties to the north could benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| from commercial or service-oriented development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| There is a site constraint on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| You can see here it's sinking creek east is this stream that runs along the property here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| crossing under Neal's Landing, which has got some guardrails in place, and then sinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| creek without the east goes north to south here and passes under Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| So the creek performs a natural barrier between the property that's to be rezoned and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| If the applicant did have plans to cross this creek from this commercially zoned, if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| gets approved to this commercially zoned area, they'd have to work with TDEC on that stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| And this is just an image of how the creeks both border the zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| And looking at Street View, there is a monument sign on the property that would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| relocated if the rezoning were to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| We'll move on to agenda item number 37, and Naomi is going to walk you through this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:28:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Bear with me as this is my first time presenting with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| I come before you with agenda item number 37, with Homestead Land Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| The address is 8205 Nubbins Ridge Drive that is located on the northwest side of Nubbins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| Ridge, oh, sorry, Road, and west of Wallace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| It is approximately 1.65 acres in the West City Sector Plan, and it is within the urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| The access is via Nubbins Ridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| It has 20 feet of existing pavement width within a 50-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| The present zoning is RA, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| They are requesting PR with up to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| The existing land use is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| To the north, we have planned residential from one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| To the south, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:35| And so to the south, we have a little bit of a technical difficulty here, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:48| bear with me, we'll work through it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| So to the south, it is agricultural and low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| And to the east, it is planned residential for one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| To the west, it is also planned residential for one to four dwelling units per acre and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| RA, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| The property is in an area that is primarily single-family residential, and it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| a slowly been developed out over the past several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:46| So I move over here to the aerial now that we've got this back loaded up, and I zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| You can see that there are surrounding single-family residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| Oh, it's still, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| And there are concerns with the site distance off of Nubbins Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| And for that reason, we are recommending the four dwelling units per acre versus the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| as requested, as it is more in line with the surrounding property areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| And I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you, Naomi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Turn it over to Mike for the next three, starting with agenda item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:53| Okay, hopefully the screen, the big one will start acting better here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Let me go back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Sorry, I'm starting off on the wrong number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Number 35, this is rezoning on Heart Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| They're asking to go from RA, Agricultural, and OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| It also has F Floodway Zone, but that will stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| They're asking to go to CA General Business and Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| So they're only rezoning the portion outside of the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| There's also a plan amendment from office and stream protection to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| and stream protection, which is required to ask for the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| You'll see that the rezoning case is actually a smaller portion, as I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| So that's what's highlighted in black is staying outside of the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| The sector plan amendment is for the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| We are recommending or I'm recommending approval with one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| So just kind of zooming in on the zoning again, because that's kind of the more complex part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| of this, at least from an existing standpoint, a small portion of the property is zoned OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| that was rezoned a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I want to say it was like 2017 and 2018, 19, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| And then it has a small sliver of AG zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| The back portion of the property back to the middle of the creek is zoned F Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| That will remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Sector plan amendment, the entire property has the office land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| It has the part of it has stream protection on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| To the east, those properties used to have the office land use classification, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| was changed in 2017, I believe, to GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| Just off the screen, just to the right is where the ACE hardware on Hardin Valley is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| That was the reason that that property went to GC general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| It is zoned planned commercial right now, but it had the office land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| So in order to allow consideration of the ACE hardware, the land use plan had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| updated to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| This is an aerial to give you an idea of what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| The property is predominantly wooded now, the back portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| This is a site that up by Hardin Valley has got a flat spot where the existing house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| And then it just kind of drops off in the back down to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| And then on the west side of the property, it's pretty thin and mostly in the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| So this gives you an idea a little bit of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| The F floodway is actually the zone district, which is a little bit hard to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| The next image will be a little bit easier to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And the FEMA floodway kind of extends out, kind of more jagged here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| So let me go back to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| And really what I wanted to show here is that the area where it's flat and already disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| is predominantly outside of the F floodway zone, which it cuts through right here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| the FEMA 500-year flood, which goes up this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| So this is a little bit easier to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| The F floodway zone is here, and the FEMA 500-year flood is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| So the staff recommendation is to approve the CA zoning for the portion outside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| F floodway with the condition that they do no more disturbance inside of the F floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| zone, which is here, and the 500-year flood, which goes to the southeast of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| Why would you limit the disturbance in the 500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| I thought the county would allow you to go halfway in between the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| I don't carry the weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Well, this is such a small property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| The area that's buildable, well, it's flat now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| I guess let's put it that way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| But you could petition to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Is that correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Halfway between the 500 and the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| Halfway between the 100 and the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| So would you not make the recommendation consistent with what the county would allow you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| just at least, I mean, I know it's probably not a pickup truck worth of property, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| if somebody's going to go to the extent of trying to develop that, I would assume they'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| want to take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| So there's the F floodway zone district, which is the zoning, the actual zone district, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| the FEMA floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| There's limited use of that to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I mean, granted, you can do some parking, I believe, in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| It is currently vegetated and relatively steep, so it might be, I don't know, it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| a consideration you'll want to, as an option outside of what I'm recommending, going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| the no-fill zone instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| It's just a tough site, and the idea was just to limit disturbance of the steeper slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Yeah, I agree it's a tough site, and I would encourage all the other commissioners to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| if you hadn't had a chance, to look at the public comments, because he did upload some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| information about what his plans are, and I just found it a very creative use of a challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| piece of property, but I don't disagree with the vice chair about the flood zone to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| him an opportunity to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I think he's got some challenges with what he's proposing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Going on to item number 40, I just wanted to go over this real quick, because we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:12| have one new planning commissioner, and this is a refresher for everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| This one has been postponed since January, well, it's been on the agenda a couple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| since January, but it was tabled, and now it's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| So the Beeler Road subdivision, they're requesting 86 detached house lots at 3.11 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| The planned residential zoning allows consideration up to 3.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| It's low-density residential on the sector plan, so there's no issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| Just some background context, July 2022, 86 lot subdivision was approved for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| that was mainly detached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| In December 2022, 128 lot subdivision was approved to the east of this property called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| the Fairview Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| There was a condition that they had to get access through this property, so that developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| worked with the original developer of this property to, I guess, take over the rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| and extend the road to the east through this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| I'll explain that again in a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| So this current proposal is mainly to extend the proposed road system to the east to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| access for the Fairview Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| The proposed road network is almost essentially the same as approved back in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| The house units have changed from attached units to detached units, but the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| units is pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| It's actually the same, 86 detached house lots compared to 86 attached lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| And the recommendation is to approve with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| So this is the new Baylor Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Okay, so just some context, Beeler Farms subdivision is just to the north, has 53 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:20| The Fairview Road subdivision, which I just mentioned, is just to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| That has yet to be developed, obviously, because it needs access to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Then what was formerly called B&B Builders subdivision is this current site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| Let me get my arrow, and it lays out a little easier to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| So this property is one we're discussing, what was formerly called the B&B Builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| site and now is called the Beeler Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| I didn't update this number, but that's supposed to be 86 as well, not 87 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| Okay, so the main revision, this was the previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| There was a cul-de-sac right before the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| This proposal is to extend this road over to the Fairview site over the creek, has four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| more lots here where there previously was just common open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Other changes is the original Beeler or B&B Builders subdivision had, used an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| pond as an amenity, they had a little trail system that went off the cul-de-sac back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| that pond area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Then they also had a trail that went along this detention pond area, and there was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| a planning commission condition to extend a pedestrian path over to the property to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| So this proposal eliminates those pedestrian paths and trails, not that they couldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| installed in the future, particularly down to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I think this property to the, or this trail to the pond is pretty much compromised by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| That's probably more limiting in use anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| Some of the recommendations to note is we are recommending a stub out connection to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| the south, because it's a fairly substantial property, plus with the, this has 86 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| and then the adjacent Fairview Road property to the east has 128 lots, which it goes well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| over what we would normally want to see, two access points of usually around 150 lots is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| when we want to see at least two access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| So the thought is, is to at least require a stub out in this location, because the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| to the south is, has its own frontage on Beeler Road, eventually hopefully we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| a second access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| The Fairview Road subdivision does have conditions of stub outs as well as a condition of a stub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| out to the north and to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I think both of those are more challenging to actually get road, like external road access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| It seems like they'd probably be better to, or might be used more for just making the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| subdivision bigger rather than actually getting access to an external road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| But it doesn't mean that they couldn't, there is still that possibility of getting access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| to an external road through the Fairview Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| One of the conditions regarding the stub outs is that if they, if we do require a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| here, one of the two stub outs in the Fairview Road subdivision could go away at the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| There's also a condition of greenway easement, either just to the east of the stream, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| they could potentially come in off the cul-de-sac around the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| So that there is a proposed greenway corridor just to the south on Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| So because of the proximity to Beaver Creek greenway corridor, which is less than a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| mile away, this property does fall within the sidewalk ordinance for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| The ordinance requires, would then require a sidewalk along either along Beaver Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| and on internal roads that have a thousand trips per day or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| So this main road coming in would hit that threshold of a thousand trips as well as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| So they're showing sidewalks on it in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| Just as an indication of what the sidewalk ordinance would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| This is just illustrating what I mentioned, that there is a requirement for a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| to the north in the Fairview Road subdivision and a stub out to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| That didn't specify exactly where that would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| I do have one question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| If you can go back to the stub out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| This or the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| The very last one you showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Yeah, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| And I'm just looking at you, I guess you said the south side, the topography looks pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| steep there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| I mean, is it even feasible to try to have a stub out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| I think it'd be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| This is a pretty wide, wide way for Beaver Creek as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| You have a tributary for Beaver Creek that comes on to the north, from the north and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| the main channel of Beaver Creek kind of goes off to the east here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| So I think it would be challenging, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Yeah, just from a design standpoint, I think it would be very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| So I guess my question is, should we try to force it and require it when it's not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| feasibly done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| So this is in the Fairview Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| So these two are already technically required by the previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:46:03| With this approval, if it's approved as recommended, this new stub out to the south would be, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| know, very on plane with the adjacent property and then the developer could choose to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| one of these two stub outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| We'll move on to our last one, which is item number 46, Holston Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:33| Okay, so this is an after the fact approval for a road retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| They've been operating already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| They do have notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| They did have neighbors complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| So I just want to make sure you're aware of that because you might hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| I'm not sure if anyone has signed up to attend the meeting yet or not, but this did become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| an agenda item because of an enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| So this is the image here is exactly what you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| This is what they're going to use as their event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| They already have parking set up for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| Everything's gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| They come off of McCubbins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| They do need to still verify their site distance because they might be short on site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| on McCubbins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| And there's two other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| So recommendations of approval are pretty straightforward, except for one of them, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| is any roll retreat area within 200 feet, within the 200 foot setback of an external| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| I guess you can't have, basically they can get a neighbor to sign a waiver to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| that 200 foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Sorry, I didn't really finish my thought when I was making this bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| Any rural retreat use area within 200 feet of a setback or an external boundary of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| property requires a waiver from the adjacent property owner before the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| can approve a reduction of that peripheral setback, the use area setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| They have not obtained those waivers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| I understand one of the neighbors may not be interested in providing that waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| And really it's not for the event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| The event center's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| And I'll show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| So in this, the blue lines here are the 200 foot peripheral setback or use area setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2911)|
| 0:48:40| There's two glamping sites on the site, on the property that are well within that 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| And there's also an existing house that they use for the facility that's within that 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:54| foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| So this review and approval is purely just for the event center, not for those other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| If they do obtain those waivers, they can come back to the Planning Commission and request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| those to be added to the rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| But as of right now, they just don't have the waivers and they need to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| with at least the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| Mike, the house on the front, if they want to use that for an office or for any function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| or whatever, obviously that abuts a road right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| Would you, who would you get to agree, the people across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| Yeah, we, there was an early on rural retreat on Keller Bend that had a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| They wanted to use an existing house near the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| They would use it for, you know, changing areas for brides and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| A daughter got married there, that's exactly what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| In that case, they, the 200 foot and 300, there was actually a 300 foot buffer too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| that's a little bit different, but it doesn't, the 300 foot buffer does not apply to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| this property sits in relation to other structures on other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| But anyway, that buffer did apply across the street, therefore they couldn't include that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| as part of their rural retreat officially, so same thing would apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| There's really not any existing structures anywhere near this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| If they can, that might be a neighbor who would be willing to give them a waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| It's kind of an odd situation, because if they did not include it as part of the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| retreat, they could still rent the house out, just not as part of the rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| This glamping is a little bit different, that's considered a campsite, campsites aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| allowed in the ag zone, this property's on ag, so they would have to, if they do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| get the glamping approved as part of the rural retreat, they would have to seek a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| Mike, I have an email that came in while you were talking that the neighbors are in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| to the glamping within the 200 feet, so they're not willing to sign the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Okay, so what Steve said was that there was an email that came in not long ago that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| neighbors, one of the neighbors to the west of the glamping site was not willing to sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| a waiver for the glamping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| So it's probably going to be challenging for them to make, to include that as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| That concludes what we have identified to discuss with you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:59| Is there anything else that you all would like to talk about before we conclude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| I've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| I don't want Miles to think we get done early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Can we look at number 17 real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| I think it's Ms. Hillman's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| I guess I just want to clarify around it, I guess, why is, do we know why it was MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:35| plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| And I guess that's basically what I want to know, why it might have been MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:52| And then, I mean, it kind of looks to me like kind of one of the spot zonings that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| talked about going from CG2 to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| So I just wanted to draw attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| This one is an interesting case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| It was part of a former planned district tied to the apartment development to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| And in that plan that was approved as part of that district, it was approved for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:42| uses even though the overall land use maintained the MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3222)|
| 0:53:51| And part of the reason why we are recommending approval of CG1 is based on the actual build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| out of the adjacent parcel, which is also more in conformance with CG1 in terms of dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| standards with setback build to zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| And with the original plan that was approved back in the 90s, I think, which shows, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:21| know, a design that is not in conformance with CG2 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| That was part of the basis for recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| We'll see you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230711-agenda-review?start=3287)|
