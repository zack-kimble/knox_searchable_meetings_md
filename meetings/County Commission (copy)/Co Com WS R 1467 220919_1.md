| 2:23:11| The city of Knoxville will also be providing the identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| abatement if you so approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| So with that, if it's okay with you, Chairwoman Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| I'd like to ask Joe to come up and talk a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| Axel, and afterwards, I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| Commissioners, while Mr. Petrie is approaching the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| you do have a, if you haven't seen it, there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| I would say pamphlet, but it's a lot better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| a booklet from Axel Logistics at your work area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| Mr. Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| I'm Joe Petrie with Lawlor Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| I'm the project manager for the first project, Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| and also for this building, Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| My address is 900 South Gay Street, Riverview Tower, Suite 1600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| Drusilla has, yeah, the PowerPoint's on your screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| and if we could, it's very quick, but it's really worth it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| You know, they say a picture's a thousand words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| and that picture right there probably is the essence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| Those right there, the background behind the Axel logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| is the jobs that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| And if you look at the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| these are South Knoxville raised guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| South Doyle High School graduates that went on to UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| got their first jobs out of college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| saw a better way to do it, started their own company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| and the rest is exponential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| My personal history with them probably goes back to 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| Actually, one of them was a renter of mine in college at UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| over in some rental property that we owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| and he was a great renter, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| but that was Drew Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| So I've known these guys for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| but really started working with them in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| We put them in the Langley building as a lease tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| They had 11 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| and soon they were expanding and expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| and growing out of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| Today, we have, in essence, 381 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| but that number changes almost on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8719)|
| 2:25:23| They're constantly onboarding new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| on a week-by-week basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| And if I can impress on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| probably the most important thing about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| about this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| and the power of this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| is in its job creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| This building, this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| Phase I has been a complete success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| in terms of what we promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| 200 jobs within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| Those 200 jobs were already filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| within the first year and a half of the new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| And it's a little tough on the real estate guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| because my other responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| is buying the property for Phase II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| finding temporary space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| that they can keep onboarding their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| while they're growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| while we're trying to get the new building built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| The next page is awards that they've won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| four times the Knox New Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| top workplaces to work in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| seven times at the bottom of Inc. 5000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| fastest-growing companies in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| That tells the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| Philanthropic impact is the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| And that's part of why they're in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| You see that they contribute to the Boys and Girls Clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| That's three blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Their employees can literally walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| to one of the community projects that they support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| If we keep flipping through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| we can talk about the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| It's actually grown since our pilot application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| So, Jucely, if you can go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| It starts looking at the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| These are pictures of the completed building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| As it was completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| you'll see that it's, with the exception of the guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| doing the layup, it's void of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| But back to the front page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| that shows you what their floor looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| filled with desks, filled with the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| that, quite frankly, I haven't really witnessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| among companies in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| So we try and do some things that are amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| where they can work hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| but take some time to play hard as well and take breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| If you go on past that slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| it really talks about, really shows you where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| So this is right on North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| You see the edge of the old Hull Dobbs building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| that was Project 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8863)|
| 2:27:44| That was completed in January of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| The new building is actually a little larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| than this rendering shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| This was our rendering until two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Two weeks ago, we added a floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| and approximately 200 more spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| We just can't quite keep the pace of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| with the growth of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| So the next several slides are just kind of placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| of the building, where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| This is along Pruitt Street, so Central and Pruitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| Pruitt runs through the two buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| and therefore they can access one building to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| But both facilities have the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| They're trying to make an environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| where there's no better, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| There's only great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| And so you can work in either building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| You get an old building that's a cool renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| or you get a modern building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8913)|
| 2:28:34| and all the amenities that come with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| With that, we'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| Thank you, Mr. Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Mr. Odom or Mr. Petrie or Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| whoever wants to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| What is the amount of property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| that are currently coming into Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| now on the site that's proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| It's around $5,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| And those $5,000 would not be included in the abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8939)|

| 2:29:07| If this is approved, you will continue to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| Knox County will continue to get $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| just like it has from now for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| How long has it been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| $5,000, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| I didn't look that far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Five years, ten years, more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| Not long, because that's based on the new purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| Based on the new purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| So that $5,000 will continue in perpetuity at a bare minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| It will, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| I'm getting to the next part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| And when this would just start producing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| additional property tax after the 10-year mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| and 15-year mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| what will the property tax that will come to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| By our estimate, it would be about $400,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| $5,000, $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| How much does a pilot cost the taxpayers of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| And can you outline similar other tax abatement projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| that we have approved over the last several years in commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| What was the positive economic output of those thereafter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| I don't have those numbers with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| but you all have done Jewelry Television, Green Mountain Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| There's been relocation projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| Now I went blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| Let's just take those two, Jewelry Television and Green Mountain Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| Both were under pilots that we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Both have had massive employment and economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| and it costs the taxpayers zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| Pilots actually are looking to expand their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| Even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| I just want to remind our commissioners that these are tools that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| Pilots and TIFs are tools that we use that do not cost the taxpayers anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| but have huge economic input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| These are ways that we can attract companies, keep companies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| And when Mr. Odom came to us, I think for the last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| he's come to us as a representative of the chamber saying that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| such minuscule growth in our young people to stay here in our workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9069)|
| 2:31:15| and we are trying desperately to figure out how do our 20-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| and 30-year-olds stay in Knoxville and not leave for other markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| And I think this is an exceptional example of a tool that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| that costs the taxpayers nothing, can keep a company growing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| instead of moving elsewhere, which they have other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| and they certainly could go other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| and has the ability to turn a $5,000 property tax into $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| in a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| And I'm happy to approve it or support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| Thank you, Commissioner Jade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| First of all, I heard axle logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| I want to be an honorary team member one day because I just want to be cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| and play basketball and sit in those chairs and do all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| Commissioner, I think they don't want honorary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| They want you to go ahead and just come on board full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Well, my plate is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| But when we talk about real estate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| you can always come visit my campus and have a space if you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I'll just put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| But anyway, I'm just wondering about the degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| What type of degree do you need to work at axle logistics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| They are a huge hiring force behind the logistics degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| that come out of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| But they're not limiting to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| They have liberal arts and other degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| You don't even have to have a degree because there's a variety of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| sales, operations, something they call 360,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| which is sales and operations together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| kind of beginning to end of the routing of transportation, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| So, ultimately, there's a factor that is energy and drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9169)|
| 2:32:57| And if you look at their corporate website, their values say it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| what they're looking for in their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| I want to echo what Commissioner Jay said about incentivizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| I'm actually working on my economic and community developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| certification through the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| and that was something that was really emphasized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| using incentives to help grow a workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| So I am standing with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| I'm also supporting this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| I think it's very innovative, in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| and something that we should consider in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| And thank you, ATSIL, for being really cool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| because we need young people to be leaders in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| and stay in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| Mr. Petrie and Mr. Cohen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| I just want to thank you for coming last Thursday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| to meet with a couple of commissioners that really helped understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| what this project was and make us support that from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| So I appreciate you taking the time out to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| If there are no other commissioners who wish to speak, I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| Mr. Petrie, can you expand on the projected job numbers that essentially are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| cause for this Phase II?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9258)|
| 2:34:19| We opened a new building in January of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9259)|
| 2:34:25| During COVID, I might add, they never stopped working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| Maybe went home for a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| Hardly ever, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| So maybe a week in the thick of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| Beyond that, we started planning the expansion in the same building where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9279)|
| 2:34:44| took the basement and added approximately 40 jobs down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| And what we were seeing was that we were running out of space almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9288)|
| 2:34:54| And so as they began to project, the projections kept getting better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| That was evidenced by the jobs that they were actually hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| And we began to plan Phase II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| So in May of 21, April of 21, we completed the sale on Brown Appliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| and began the planning process for Phase II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| which has been anywhere from a 30,000-square-foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| to what is now an 85,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| And it will hold approximately 840 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| And those, although some people may move from one side of the street to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| that represents new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| To a total campus number of approximately, well, between 1,100 and 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9339)|
| 2:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| I know you're currently leasing one space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| and are looking to lease more due to the job growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| Will you explain to the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| how Axel approaches these properties that they lease and how they leave them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9357)|
| 2:36:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9365)|
| 2:36:06| One space was a sublease that we leased from Tombris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9366)|
| 2:36:13| whose workforce shrank a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| maybe because they were able to work from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| So not to detract from Tombris in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| but they just had some extra space not in their main office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9381)|
| 2:36:25| So we accomplished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| The accounting department moved there in some operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| Just accounting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| And then we're leasing more space where, literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| Axel is going to be putting a million dollars of their dollars into a two-year lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| so that they can keep the hiring process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| And they'll leave that new facility, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| we're this close to signing the lease, so I'd rather not say where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| but it's in an expansion of downtown that you're all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| I could tell you it's Magnolia area, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| But until we sign the lease, I'd rather not say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| We don't want to count our chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| But that can hold approximately 200 employees while we are building the new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9426)|
| 2:37:13| That million dollars stays with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| It's in the form of bathrooms and electricity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| and all the things that make it functioning for Axel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| We'll take the furniture, but that's separate from the million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| That isn't even included in the million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| And also, as was in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| Axel is very involved in philanthropic opportunities throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9456)|
| 2:37:42| And one of the issues in this area, and this area is near and dear to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| because it's close to where I grew up and it's in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| is the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| And if you are trying to bring in employees or to make new hires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9472)|
| 2:37:59| that can be a huge deterrent if you have panhandlers outside of your building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| So rather than turning a blind eye or looking to relocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| they are actually working with Burt Rosen of CARM on solutions for the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| I mean, obviously that's not going to be fixed overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| but they are at least willing to come to the table to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| And so I really appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| I appreciate everything they are doing for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| and will continue to do, the job growth, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| I can't speak their praises enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| If you haven't had the chance to tour the facility, I recommend you do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| It is really cool, and the energy is super high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| and they are really making their mark here, and I really appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9521)|
| 2:38:47| Madam Chair, I would like to point out that Knox County has been so helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| in this whole process, and especially with helping us in gaining new parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| things like that, that are all parts, compliments, and necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| for what they are doing on this campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| So we are very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| The first pilot, other ancillary issues, and now this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| And just to clarify, you mentioned the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| That was a city-only pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9554)|
| 2:39:15| The county did not have a pilot for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9555)|
| 2:39:20| You didn't tell us about the other pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9564)|
| 2:39:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9565)|
| 2:39:26| As a former HR director, I just have to echo what everyone has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| but also to John and Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| This is something that people like me dream of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| I actually reached out to some of your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| and just had some conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| When your employees want to come to work, and they love to come to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| and they are successful, then you are successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| And this is exactly what Knox County needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| As the mother of a 17- and an 18-year-old boy, one at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| this is what they are starving for in their hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9595)|
| 2:40:00| And so I hope that we will use Axel as a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| to really show other companies what we can offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| and how we can do it and be innovative and out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9607)|
| 2:40:10| So I just want to applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| I'm not John or Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| I should have mentioned that the principals were not able to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| They're out of town on a company business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| They do plan on attending next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| I can echo the sentiments you heard from our other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| It's an awesome place to go to every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| Yeah, I've got a kid maybe changing their major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| The motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| and to second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| Item number 58, Resolution 907,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| is approving the execution of an interlocal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| relating to Joint Economic and Community Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| There is a motion on the floor to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9681)|
| 2:41:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| I understand you were the author of this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| And this involves the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9700)|
| 2:41:46| When you were comprising this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| did you reach out to the city or to the town for their input at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9711)|
| 2:41:58| The agreement was distributed to the board, the TTC board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| and discussed at the TTC board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| I believe Mayor Williams had it missed because it was the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| that he was having his vote tallied that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| I forwarded it to Tom Hale, the town of Farragut attorney, about a week ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| and left him two or three voicemails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| We just have not hooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| Tom's a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| I'm anxious to answer any questions he may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| He's called back and said he had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| But the city has it on their agenda for tomorrow evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| and their law department has reviewed it and signed off on it, save Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| Well, when we got it last Monday, I did forward it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| because I represent the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| I did send it to the town administrator as well as the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| and they had not seen it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9760)|
| 2:42:44| And I did confirm with them by phone this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| that they have no issues with that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| More confused than I am, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| And then on page three, you just have a typo on the zip code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| for the Farragut Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9779)|
| 2:43:08| It should be 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| And then on page five of the interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| you've got everybody's name listed on the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9798)|
| 2:43:21| Who is the president of the Joint Economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| and Community Development Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| The president is the interim president, which is the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| Every nonprofit corporation has to have a president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| Mike Odom was elected as the interim president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| when Mr. Napier resigned to take another position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| So his name will appear where it says president?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9832)|
| 2:43:53| Is there any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| Mr. Mamentoff, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| No, this is a significant change in our economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| and we've really not had an opportunity to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| in front of this board because of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| This is a significant change in our economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| and we've really not had an opportunity to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| in front of this board because of the sort of unique nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| of the way TDC has been funded over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| and the way industrial development boards work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| I had a long conversation with Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| this afternoon about the pros and cons of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| We're trying to align Knox County more consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| with what some of the other successful economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| counties in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| When we started looking at these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| at the mayor's request two or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| two of the counties that they highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| were Montgomery and Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| which both do it the way this is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| which is they hold their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| in the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| There's a litany of legal reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| why that is the safest way to hold public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| and the most transparent way to hold public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| There's a long history to the TDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| why it was formed, why it may have made sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| when it was formed from a legal structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| but things have changed in terms of legal interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| Open meeting laws, application and open records laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| to the TDC have changed significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| since it was formed many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| And so we're trying to wisely use taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| to try to be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| and also to align the economic development operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| of the county consistent with what other successful counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| have done across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| This is a pretty big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| Because you're primarily a funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| and you've already proved in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| that the funding that traditionally went to the TDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| is going to the chamber this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| so that they can do the economic recruitment activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| that the TDC was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| So this is fulfilling the goals of that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| to try to achieve that aim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| And so I'm really glad they answered any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| We want to be totally transparent to try to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| We've been for about a year going back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| with the TDC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| And it's a wonderful board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| Some of the best people in our community are on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| Many of you all have served on that board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| And so it's nothing to do with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| We're trying to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| a different economic development model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9991)|
| 2:46:32| I thought of the other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| I did read the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| annotated 6-58-114,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| which stipulates what you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| on a joint economic and community development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| And will 100% of what is now under the existing body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10004)|
| 2:46:51| move over to the joint economic and community development board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10011)|
| 2:46:56| the IDB money, any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| So TDC historically has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| the holder of basically your all's industrial parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| which is pretty unusual to have a private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| non-profit corporation hold your industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| And so now they would be held by a public entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| which will give a number of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| Again, I don't want to take... You've had a long evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| I can be glad to talk to any of you all separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| I'm glad to go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| So basically this legal entity, presently called the TDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| will stop being a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| The ownership of the industrial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| that are held for economic recruitment purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| that you all have acquired and funded over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| would be transferred to the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| What would remain in this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| This board was approved as this JCEDB years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| To go back and ask for approval of a different board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| would be a big hassle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| If I were you all, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| why do we even need this board at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| These boards are anachronism. It's archaic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| They were... In the battles over annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| we created these boards to try to make peace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10081)|
| 2:48:04| among cities and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| Nobody's fighting over annexation anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| Do we even really need these boards anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| Ironically, David Buick and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| the first time I met him was fighting annexation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| And so that's... I'm sorry. I'm sitting up there. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| It's just not happening anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| But for two reasons under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| to be eligible for certain types of grants from ECD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| we have to maintain this JCEDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| So under state law, as you saw, Commissioner Skinmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| that you have to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| You have to have the three mayors, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| And because you all are the largest populate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| we asked and hope you all will approve this, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| that you all will have more representation than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| The chair of the commission would also continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| So you would have two of the seven members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| Then you have the two mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| They amended the statute, and you may have seen this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| to encourage school participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| So we're adding the superintendent as somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| because they want him to talk about drug problems in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| and stuff at this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| And then you have to have two citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| one who's a rural property owner and one who represents industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| So we're downsizing this, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| to reflect just what state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| All they would do is meet quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| and basically discuss economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| and similar issues that affect our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10160)|
| 2:49:28| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| Mr. Mametoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| Did you confirm that position on that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| will also include the chair of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| Yes, yes, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| So, and Mr. Caldwell or Mr. Odom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10184)|
| 2:49:51| I don't know who best to ask this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| The money right now that the commission currently allots to TDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10194)|
| 2:49:58| will just go to the chamber instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| It already started as of July 1, this fiscal year, doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| Doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| Because when Mr. Napier resigned and Mr. Odom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| he's on my left here, so he became the interim president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| And so they're not paying him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10216)|
| 2:50:19| It's part of his thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| But the economic development activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| and the maintenance of the industrial parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| and that needed to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| so that money is going to the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| where they're taking care of that presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| for the benefit of the TDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| And once the land transfers, it would be for the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| of the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10240)|
| 2:50:41| So if Mr. Odom wants you fully absorb all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10241)|
| 2:50:47| and the expenses and everything involved with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| and you then do you foresee that the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10251)|
| 2:50:59| that commission already allots to this will increase, will decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10259)|
| 2:51:07| What do you foresee in our future of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| So the funding that you all have redirected to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10272)|
| 2:51:17| from what was typically going to TDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| is, for the lack of a more polished answer, is a break-even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| So we don't make any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| We don't lose any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| The only way we would see that increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| is if some reason the expenses related to the parks themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| the operations and maintenance would increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| but we don't foresee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| As we sell those parcels off, there's less for us to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10300)|
| 2:51:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| Seeing none, the motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| And that motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| Commissioners, I just wanted to kind of take a poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| It's been a moment since we've had a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| If anyone needs to get up, stretch their legs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| or do we want to keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10334)|
| 2:52:15| I think we only have one item left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| It's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| We have four zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| Oh, we're talking about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| Commissioner Dutty just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| Power on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| Item number 60, discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10349)|
| 2:52:33| to consider moving the February 2023 commission meeting date due to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| conflict with county government day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| Mr. Skinbaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| On February 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| we are scheduled to have our county commission meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10367)|
| 2:52:53| That is also the first day of county government day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| which goes into the next day, which is Tuesday, the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| Since I got on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| Knox County has had a very unique presence in Nashville for that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10384)|
| 2:53:13| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10393)|
| 2:53:15| The legislative delegation appreciates seeing commissioners from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| and I think it's important that we continue that tradition of attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| that county government day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| which is sponsored by Tennessee County Services Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10406)|
| 2:53:30| So my recommendation to this body would be to move the work session to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10410)|
| 2:53:34| February the 13th, which is a Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| and then the regular commission meeting to the Tuesday, February 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| because February 20th is a national holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10423)|
| 2:53:50| And I believe Drew has been trying to work with our friends at PBA to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10430)|
| 2:53:55| if we can lock in that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| The 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| Well, actually, for us, it would be the 13th and the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| Well, we have the 21st already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| We do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10446)|
| 2:54:07| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| For our regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10451)|
| 2:54:12| Why not the 21st and 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| The 28th is still we're still in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| Oh, all day, not just the morning session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| Is it just the morning session or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| So you're saying to shift it to another Tuesday instead of the regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| Yeah, I'm saying we already have the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| Why not Tuesday, Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| Because the commissioner's day on the Hill would be all day Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| and then isn't there any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| it's only like morning stuff on the next day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| Or not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| Yeah, but we've gone over to see some of the legislators that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10484)|
| 2:54:48| I know that I've stayed there until like five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| On the next day after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10490)|
| 2:54:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10491)|
| 2:54:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| That's why we wanted to move everything up a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| Yeah, I was just going to say last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| I think we moved it to week two and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| and did the day after President's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| I think last year we actually had to go to the small assembly for one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| the two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| But you said we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10507)|
| 2:55:08| We have the 21st reserved for our regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| For work session, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| So we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| So that could be our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| It's just a matter of what we can get on the 13th for work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| Do you think we can get either one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10521)|
| 2:55:27| Oh, they've said that they're not available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| No, they have to submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| Oh, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| I didn't misunderstand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| Yeah, go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| But I just want to alert you in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10536)|
| 2:55:37| So for your calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10537)|
| 2:55:41| Does anyone have any glaring issue with moving up to the work session to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10541)|
| 2:55:46| the 13th, and then regular session to the 21st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| Any objections to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| Monday, the 13th for work session, and Tuesday, the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10554)|
| 2:56:02| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| Thank you, Commissioner Schuman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10565)|

| 2:56:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| These two, 61, 62, and 73 and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10604)|
| 2:56:50| I suggest that if you're possible to go look at these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10610)|
| 2:56:56| Seeing it in person is worth more than a thousand words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| If you can't, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| But I would like for you to see these two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10622)|
| 2:57:07| Do we have to read the rest of them in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| I'm just going to go ahead and comment if we have to read it in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| The last one is in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| And long story short, we've been working on this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10634)|
| 2:57:19| It should have been a transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| It was not discussed at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| So now we have to go with commercial to get these people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| It's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| It's a $750,000 investment in Vestal, which is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10650)|
| 2:57:36| And so I would like, and it's a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| It's a good fit for what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| I just want people to go out there and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| Since we cannot speak about zonings unless we call the special 48-hour meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10664)|
| 2:57:50| I appreciate John and Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10670)|
| 2:57:57| I was starting to say Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| We got to talk about zonings at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| and I think we're going to try to do that monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| Because there's a lot of questions on zonings that I would love to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| Commissioner Lundy, I need you to go look at this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| But it's not legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| We cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10696)|
| 2:58:17| So that's all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| Since you said we didn't need to, then this is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| No, it's just all it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| The only way I could get it is to CONDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10714)|
| 2:58:41| Commissioner Daley, Costello Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10721)|
| 2:58:49| It's CONDA Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| Costello Homes is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10730)|

| 2:58:55| We'll know when we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| You know, sometimes you get on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| You go across Chapman Highway, John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10740)|
| 2:59:04| Denwood's on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| Take it until it dead ends, and you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| The dead end, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| It's the dead end right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| And also, don't you think looking at the satellite view would help, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| If you can't go, look at the satellite view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| Look at it both, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| And then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| It's only a small track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| And then the Commission Office wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| that all commissioners kept your resume packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| They're not going to reprint that thing for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| Director Buch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| Yeah, I don't get into policy, and I don't intend to now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| but I would like to step away as being law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| and say I've been a lifetime resident of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10784)|
| 2:59:49| and anything that puts $750,000 into Vestal, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10789)|
| 3:00:00| That takes us to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| I just want to remind my colleagues that between beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10802)|

| 3:00:22| at 530 at East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10827)|
| 3:00:28| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| Hopefully everyone gets to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| Let's have a good showing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| and show the other area commissioners how involved we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| They already know how involved we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| Thank you, Terry, for Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=10842)|
