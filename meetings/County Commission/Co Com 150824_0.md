| 0:06:24| We noticed once we got to the premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| that there were three different locations on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| that they were serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| When you entered the property, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| was a beer truck called Barger's Beer Truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| On that beer truck, they had two different types of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| and wine that you could just walk up to and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| whatever you liked, how much ever you liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| All three agents, we went and we got wine, we got beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| We went back two different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Was it unattended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| It had a server there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| And then on the inside, it's called the pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| They have what's called a martini bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| And at the martini bar, they were serving mixed drinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| as well as beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| And then up at the stables, they had another bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| that was also serving wine and beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| At that time, we got one of our informants to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| And we took him to all three different serving stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| At the first serving station, which was the beer truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| he was served a Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| And he was not ID'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| At the second serving station was the martini bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| He was served two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| It was called Seven and Shine, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| is Moonshine and Seven Up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| He was not ID'd there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| And at the third station at the stables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| he was served a Bud Light draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| And he was not ID checked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| In the span of an hour, one of our agents, Agent Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| was served eight alcoholic and beer drinks combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| And our informant was served four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| It was two beers and two alcoholic drinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| within the span of 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Agents were told that they could drink as much as they liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| There was no limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| We found this to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| And they were cited criminally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| The servers were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| We issued three criminal citations, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| to each server, for serving to a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| without checking ID properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Did you issue any citations to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| We did not at the time, which we could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| It was a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| We wanted to consult with our headquarters in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| to see how they wanted to handle it and to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Because ultimately, we'd like this type of activity to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| We knew that if we issued a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| we didn't know if, in the end, it would actually cease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| or if it would just be dismissed because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| such a low-level misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| But it is still under investigation at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| And we still are working a case on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| and trying to gather everything of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| we need to do to proceed to make sure that type of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| does not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Because according to the law, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| cannot dispense alcohol or beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| OK, next question is, when is the adjudication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| for the servers in General Sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=531)|
| 0:08:51| Their court date is August 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| No, that's day after tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| OK, do you have anything else to bring before this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| I guess, Commissioner Brown, did you have a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Under the Tennessee law, there's no distinction, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| between giving it away and selling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| as long as you're providing it to someone, a minor or other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Right, they consider sale and service the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I just want to be sure that we get that out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Right, we have an appellate court decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| to actually back that up, stating that it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Can you present, I mean, not today, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| but can you, that appellate court decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| we'd like to see that, if you have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| or if you can get it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| If I could speak briefly on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| the appellate court decision, we will provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| to every member that wishes one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| But that, under the liquor law, or the liquor code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| it says sale, furnish, serve, give, and that's 57-4203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| In the event, Captain May cited under the beer code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| that just says sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| So the appellate court took up a case in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| to when a sale actually took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| if the sale took place when the alcohol hit the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| basically, or when that, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| what that goes into, into depth on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| We'd like to see that, if you could email it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Third of Wolfe, and he'd get it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I'll send it to, I'll send it to Wolfe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| and we'll get you all a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| It's a pretty interesting read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| OK, Commissioner Brown, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I've got one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Ms. Long, in regard to the last paragraph of your report here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| one caterer went as far as to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| that he had quoted a bride $700 in Hunter Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| undercut him, and provided his service for $600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| And one reported that their general manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| saw money being exchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Also, there's something in here, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| don't know what paragraph it was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| They quoted him saying they could get you anything they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| How is that going to, is that going to have a bearing on this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| as far as what your prosecution would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| All of that currently, right, all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| is what I was speaking of earlier, is currently under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| We are in the process of looking at different sales receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| and talking to different caterers, and different establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| to see what all exactly took place in this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| Well, she'd stated earlier, in her answer to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| that her staff had had all this server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| If they had the server training, they're sure not going by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=705)|
| 0:11:45| They did, the three that we cited actually did have their ABC cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| They had been to the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| It was, from just speaking to the ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| it was kind of my understanding that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| don't come out there to get drunk, was one of their exact words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| So it's kind of like they weren't used to people coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| there that were underage, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| So they just thought that it was OK just to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| And they never even checked his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| So the three that you pulled out were the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| that had had the server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| They'd all had their server training cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| and they'd been to server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| And didn't do them a lot of good, did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| And we were on the premise for an hour, and at no point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| because we stayed in the areas where the bars were located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| at no point did we ever see IDs being checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| It wasn't just our minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| We didn't see anyone asked to show their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| What was that code again I was trying to write,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| but my eyeballs weren't working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| 574203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| 4203, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| When asked before if any beer had been sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| I guess it wasn't sold, because it was given away here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| But apparently, in some of these paragraphs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| on the second page, it talks about there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| been events in the past, and they've served beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=783)|
| 0:13:12| It's kind of troubling that beer is being sold there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| without a license at all, and especially liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| And no carting is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| I mean, it's one thing to have an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| and then at least you're carting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| that are coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| But this is really disturbing, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| when we've got a permit or an application before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| and we've already got several violations before we even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| issue the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Right, and this event was open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| so that's where we came into play with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| We don't know what happens at the private events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| but the one open to the public, and we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| saw their advertising, advertising free cocktails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| is how we learned of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| I guess the question for the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| how long have y'all been having special events there, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Get your name and address for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| Let me clarify a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Hunter Valley Farm normally provides a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| for weddings, proms, corporate events, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Typically, well, the caterers handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| the dispensing of alcohol on all occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| and several others that have catering licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| So they have an event once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| and now have started having it twice a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| frankly, because their business is so big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| at which they showcase their caterers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| And I've actually been out there for one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| The food caterers, the flower caterers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| everybody shows up, and people who are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| to use Hunter Valley Farm for a wedding venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| or a corporate venue, or any other type of event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| comes in, and they showcase it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| This is the first time they've ever dispensed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| them, other than their caterers, alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| If you go to a wedding out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| typically the caterer who's handling the food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| if there is to be alcohol served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| will be the one handling the alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| and he has a separate license, a catering license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Did I answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Yeah, I mean, that pretty much answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| I just, have you all seen this report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| It's pretty disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Before I respond, I'd like to see a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| But, yes, they do advertise on Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| that they have this event once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| hoping to people who are considering Hunter Valley Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| for a wedding venue come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| And there are numerous events out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| that alcohol is not served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| They have shows out there for a number of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| This is the first time they have ever dispensed alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| This is a question for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| And at these private events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| where the public is not invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| how are they policed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| There is an exception in that law, 57-4203-I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| that spells out for the, let me get the verbiage just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| Can you talk to her microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| That allows conventions, social gatherings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and catered events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| When they open this up to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| then it comes, I guess, out of that realm of a private party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| No, I'm just kind of wondering how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| if it is a private party, it's policed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| and we know that these caterers are doing a proper job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Well, the caterers would notify us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| they would notify us of a catered event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| that they were going to hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| whether it be in Knox County or any other county in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| And then we could subsequently check those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| make sure they're abiding by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| And I'm assuming Captain May could as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| But to have any type of an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| where you do not have a typical license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| whether it be a special occasion or a catered event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| then they have to give us notice of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| We checked and did not have any of that documentation on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Oops, hitting the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| A couple of questions, I guess, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Arthur, for the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Just so I'm clear, because I'm a little confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| This was only advertised on Facebook, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| And their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| And their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| And in that advertisement, it said free liquor, free drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| And where did that come in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Where did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| No, no, I'm just, because I'm hearing, in this it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| somewhere it said there was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Complementary cocktails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Complementary cocktails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| I'll get the website and submit it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| I believe they have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Does it say complementary cocktails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Is that what it says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| I said our favorite caterers will be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| with dinner samples and complementary cocktails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| And this event that is in this information we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| was August 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| The application for the liquor license was July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| signed July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| So I'm a little concerned that in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| we're thinking I need a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| But on August 11th, we're giving liquor away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| And I'm a little concerned with some of the answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1173)|
| 0:19:43| and what the attitude that was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| given to the state officials here that are in this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| If the state or a government or authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| the Sheriff's Department, whoever comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| onto your property and has questions for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| we all need to comply, not argue with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| or indicate they shouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| And that does cause me concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I have not had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I'm scanning this very quickly, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| I have not had a chance to read it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I wanted to clarify some things that were said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| When we were out on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| and we were actually speaking to the two owners afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| they informed us that they do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| more than one event a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| They have a barbecue event as well in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| There's two events that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| where they actually open it up and they, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| give away the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Also, they had an event in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| where there was free champagne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| And also, that is not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| true what he was saying about the caterers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| take care of all the alcohol at the weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| What happens is they partner with a liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| store who recommended or somehow get that liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| to give a better price to the brides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| The brides come in and they go purchase the alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| from the liquor store and then bring the liquor to Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Valley, and Hunter Valley has their own staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| that dispenses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| The liquor store, the owner actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| informed me that they provide or they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| sell the liquor to the brides or these wedding parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| at least two to three times a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| So at least two to three times a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Hunter Valley's bartenders are serving this alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| So that's not an exact statement that the caterers are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| and doing every event because they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| And our caterers will tell you that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| because that's where some of the complaints have come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Because that is what the caterers are supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| but they feel like they're getting undercut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| because this liquor is being sold at a cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| price from a package store, which they partner with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and they actually do the serving, not our caterers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| And I actually asked those guys that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| some of these servers, exactly how it worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| and that's the same way they explained it to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Ms. Long, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| In regards to the servers that were cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| are they Hunter Valley farm servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| I asked that exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| They had the Hunter Valley apparel on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| and they said they are employed strictly by Hunter Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| I was just asking because the thing said that our caterers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| will provide alcohol, and I was, whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| passes the alcohol is whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| And Hunter Valley doesn't have a catering license either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| So these are just people they've hired as servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| They've been through the class and the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1347)|
| 0:22:27| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| That was a big, big statement for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| That's really confusing and convoluted, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Sounds like you're advertising one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| So every one cited had the Hunter Valley logo on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| I guess we didn't pull payrolls, but they have Hunter Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1368)|
| 0:22:48| And every one of them I asked because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| knew that could be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Are you working for one of our caterers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Because none of our caterers that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| had a permit to dispense alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| So we knew none of our caterers would be dispensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| So I asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| And then also, Nancy informed me that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| had purchased two cases of wine for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| And we also know that other alcohol was purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| for the event by Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| So the alcohol was purchased by Hunter Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| and their servers did serve it, dispense it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And then I'm kind of digesting this real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| And also, you've talked to the liquor stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| So they basically told you that, and the caterers have told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| In your investigation, you've talked to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| The caterers say that they're getting into our pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| The caterers are getting undercut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| They're getting undercut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| And the liquor store is saying that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| are providing brides these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| The owner of the liquor store informed me that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| he did not know I was an ABC agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| that they had been partnering with Nancy and Becky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| for some time now, and that the brides come over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| and they give them a better deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| and that the brides bring their alcohol to Hunter Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| and they serve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Yeah, and that's where I'm headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| This sounds like a plan to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| It sounds organized to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Sounds unlawful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| And then on top of that, monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| We get folks cited here monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| And they ended up probably walking in knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| they're going to write a pretty big check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| And I've not heard of Wolfie saying folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| being disrespectful to him or his agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| And this is really the first time in my seven plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| here that I've heard folks being disrespectful to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| once they identify themselves as the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Nancy was very nice to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Becky was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| I saw that, that one was and one wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| But one of the owners not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| You know, this whole thing just sounds disconcerting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| as Commissioner Thomas has indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| I'm struggling with this one fairly mindfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| And when you say that they've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| applied at the time of this event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| the application process was due, was in, it was in some state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Arthur, I've not heard you say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| we haven't given you an opportunity to say much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Could you kind of help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| why we should grant this license today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Well, first, what you're hearing here from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| is hearsay that will be tested in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| presumably on August 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| I have not seen this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| To my knowledge, they have never been cited before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Typically, their business, and let me just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| give you a little background on this, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Their business is a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| They started out as an event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| And if I may say so, actually it was a stables out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| And Mrs. Thornton boarded horses, trained people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| and this business just grew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| People started saying, hey, Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| can I have my wedding out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Can I have my child's birthday party out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| and let them ride the ponies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| What's evolved now, it's a full-time event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| a big-time event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| When we first started trying to get this permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| because they were cited by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| for not having proper fire issues and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| it took a while to get that straightened out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| because they were using a pavilion and a barn out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| I think we're finally straight with Mr. Braden's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| and have been for a number of years, haven't we, Mr. Braden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| And the fire marshal's office, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| had to put sprinkler systems and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| that they never anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| And their zoning ordinance didn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| cover an event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| All right, they have all sorts of events out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| They have weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| They have corporate events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| They have people come out there and display for trade shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| And I don't know what percentage of the events involve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Typically, what the brides do, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| They provide the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| They hire the catering facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| They do not do any catering of food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| copper selling, other organizations like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| all occasions, businesses like that handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I am just getting into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I have not read this, even now, because I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| handed it a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| I intend to read and consult with Becky and Nancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| And once they know the law, they have always been law-abiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| And we had trouble with codes, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| weren't sure what the facilities exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| were out there, whether they could even operate out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| until we worked through all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| And we'll certainly work through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| So, Brad, could I, and I guess I'll ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| Mr. Law Director, can we ask for a delay at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| My motion was going to be a deferred deferral, depending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| I'd like to see what ABC does and what the General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Court, because more than likely, General Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| is going to defer that, as far as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| going to ask for a, well, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| the legal term for the disposition on the court case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| We expect, or not, is it a deferment on their charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| But to me, that's a, we're a body that operates on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| if they get a ruling that says it's OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| but they're going off the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| it's still a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| It's not a conviction for their criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| But as this body can see it, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| we could interpret that as a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| And so I'm a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| I'm really concerned that we're not even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| we haven't hit the part that I'm worried about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| is the on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| That's the, number one, I would imagine that, as a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| not having the liability of a liquor or a beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| and letting the caterers do all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| would be the easiest thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| And then to put this beer truck on for an off premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| I'm not good at all of that, because here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| You can take that thing anywhere you want to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| City of Knoxville, you've got to have a permit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| You've got to have a special permit to park that beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| truck somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Town of Farragut, I don't know what their beer laws are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And so how do we track that beer truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| And so I can't give a blanket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| It's for, it's going to be for private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| You can't sell beer at a location that you don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| I'm not comfortable with giving an off premise permit currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| for this beer truck after what we've heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Yeah, I don't think they'll be selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| It'll be for park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| You all do events off site at people's homes and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1810)|
| 0:30:10| I'm going to motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I'm not comfortable with the off premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| if we're having trouble complying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| with the law on the on premise, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| We have always relied upon other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| who have served the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| This is a recent addition for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| The poor boys, is it poor boys that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| at every function around town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| I assume they'll be at the one for the basketball coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| tonight, or somebody will be over at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| I don't know how they handle it, but they dispense liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| at numerous functions around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Have they ever been charged with anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1857)|
| 0:30:57| They're out of Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| One paragraph here states that Ms. Long explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| to Ms. Barger the liability they assume when they serve alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| and the responsibilities that go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Ms. Barger stated that they did not have a liquor license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| and did not want to obtain one due to the headache that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| went along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| But yet, three weeks prior to this event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| they had applied for a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Are they going to apply for a liquor license, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| At this point, my vote is they don't get either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| I mean, just to be quite frank with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| whether you sell it or whether you give it away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| you still have to ID people, or else you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| going to be liable for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| So there's just too many knotholes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| And I would agree with whoever just brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Brad, about the off-premise sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I mean, that's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Commissioner Bowles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Yes, I have a couple questions for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| What are we required to do by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| when an application for a beer license comes before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Is it like the business license, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| if they have met all the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| we are required to grant it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Or do we have some leeway or some discretion in what we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Can you explain that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Unless there is some prevailing reason based upon the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| that we ask, or some ordinance that they have violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| meaning like the distance rule, or too close to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| And right now, we haven't even asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| is the resident who owns the resident here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| and do they object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| That would be a question that would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Those type of issues, then you can deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| Where we're walking in on this one that does give some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| discretion, however, is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| no one has been convicted of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| The farm issue here has not been charged with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Now, their employees have been charged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| which kind of indirectly, you all deal with this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| The serving alone, according to an attorney general's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| I would like to see the appellate court opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| That's why I'm holding a reservation on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Serving alone does two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| It doesn't rise to the level of moral turpitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| and it doesn't rise to the level alone of denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| However, with all of this other stuff that makes it more convoluted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| you know, we're working with people in some form of action to dispense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| is this an intentional thing that we're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| That brings a lot of other questions that have to be testified to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| and proven before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| You have a discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| So it's not as black and white as the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| I'm concerned there appears to be a long history with this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| or location with having a rather flippant attitude towards the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| and what's required, going back to when they first started doing events here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| We all know that ignorance of the law is no valid excuse for breaking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2077)|
| 0:34:47| I'm very uncomfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| It seems like I remember we had to go through some kind of zoning gymnastics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| for them to allow them to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| And this is just one more layer on what looks to me like a pattern of behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| that I am extremely uncomfortable and unhappy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| Unless there is some requirement in the law that compels us to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| to give them a license, then they will not get such a vote from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| for any reason unless I'm compelled to vote that way by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Just a quick question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| It states in this investigation that beer, I think beer or liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| both was given to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Don't we have a law that says even if you dispense it to a minor, they're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| So that's what they're recited for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| The server was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| But that is an infraction of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| What does that entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Well, it's a misdemeanor in this case, however, but the point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| is the people who are charged are not the people applying for the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| It's two separate events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| And until there's an ongoing investigation, my understanding of what's been testified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| to is it relates to the principal who is applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| And as of right now, there have been no charges against the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| But those employees have been charged and they will have a hearing Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| my understanding is, and it'll be whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| But it still leaves this issue open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And the real issues, too, is, you know, there's a lot more here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| than just serving that's before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| The catering, the serving, the purchasing, there's different elements that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| other than just saying they serve to minors, which I said earlier, that alone is not significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| But there's a lot of other issues that probably need to be investigated by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| And anyway, I'll let it be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Does the entailing, one other thing to clarify this issue for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| is the people that were serving the alcohol, was beer, liquor, wine, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| did they not have on shirts that were saying that they were part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| Is that something different or am I mistaking that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Well, what we have, they had, it was testified that they had on Hunter Valley shirts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| that they, it's testified that they were employees of Hunter Valley Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| But the fact is, Hunter Valley Farms was not charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| Their employees were charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| That's the legal fact that's before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| And, but it's also been testified, too, that the state is continuing their investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| against the applicant at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And that's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Commissioner Olmey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Looking into this, I mean, the on and off I have a problem with also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| but that's not even really getting to the meat of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| But I would like to make a motion that we postpone this to the November 16th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| And that'll give Arthur time to look over what was given to him today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| and the investigation to kind of go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| And we can kind of tell where everything is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And then we can take this up again November 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2330)|
| 0:38:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| All right, go ahead, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| I think the agent wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Go ahead, go ahead, Arthur, go ahead, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| May I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| It was said, stated, and I think by Wolfie here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| that it was within a certain distance, 260 feet of a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Is that Sam Mischu's home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| I didn't write it down, but it's 265 from one building, 280 from another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| Oh, that's her house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| That's Becky's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| She lives on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| She's probably not going to protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| One of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2375)|
| 0:39:35| She'll wave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2378)|
| 0:39:38| Yeah, we'll check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Go ahead, agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I think it would be beneficial for us as well if we could meet with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| and if it's their, I'm just throwing that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| if they want to meet with us at our office with our legal team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| and we can correspond as far as normally in situations like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| we have people that come forward and say, here's what we're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| And we say, this is how you can do this, and this is how you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Are you going to need 90 days to dispose of your case, or would 60 be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| What are you comfortable with Nashville answering you back on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Well, I was hoping to have something prior to today's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| but that wasn't possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| And that's the reason I've already conferred with the district attorney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| office 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I think this is actually less than 90, because November, we're a week ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| We'll do November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Like I said, I'd be more than happy to get a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| To come to the best resolution, instead of just hashing over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Is there still the possibility that charges will be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| against Hunter Valley Farms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| I'm not at liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Like I said, that's still under investigation at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I've conferred with the DA's office, and now I'm back conferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| with my legal staff in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| And I think it would probably be simpler if my legal staff would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| get with the DA's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| But we're continuing to work on that as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| There's just, as someone else has already alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| there's a number of different issues here to include catering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| to include on-premise, off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| If the beer truck is going to have, you know, if you all license a beer truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| if we're going to license that beer truck or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| So we're having to try to get all that stuff to sort of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| through the weeds on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| All right, the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| You have something, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Yeah, I want to try to dispel, if I can, any implication these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| are running a rogue or nefarious operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| They are running a business that is utilized by people all over East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| When they started out, they got into the business purely accidentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| There are other businesses that have not had the same supervision they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| by Knox County that provide wedding venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Their homes, and I'm not going to name them because although they're competitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| they have not had to comply with the requirements Hunter Valley has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Hunter Valley, when it has been presented, and after consulting with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| that they have to do certain things, has done it all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| But when they started out, they were a business that didn't fit anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| in the zoning ordinance and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And we have worked all those issues out at a not insignificant cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| And we intend to work this one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| They are not trying to evade or violate the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| They want to be compliant with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| They don't want to be down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| They don't want to hire me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| They would rather be having an event where they can make a little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| Lawyers do not make you money most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| We have a motion on the floor to defer to Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Just one thing, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| This event is a very popular place, this event center in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| As a matter of fact, I'm invited to a wedding there this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Probably the menu may change, however, it is a very popular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| And I can see where their troubles happen because it's just grown overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| I mean, that's where all the girls want to be married and proms and things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| But at the same time, we have to work within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| And we've got to be sure that these kids and these people, when they leave there, are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| drunk and they're illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2623)|

| 0:44:07| Justin, I'm going to ask you a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2647)|

| 0:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Has beer ever been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2684)|

| 0:45:35| Yeah, I'm well aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2736)|

| 0:45:48| The building is approximately 202 feet from the church called the Injun Pop Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| Where's that at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Is it in, oh, it's in the same complex, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| 7219 Clinton Highway is the church's address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| That's in the same, is it still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| The church is still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| May I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=2766)|

| 0:52:09| Now, I need to make a couple of sentences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| on what my memory may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| and that has to do with since Richard left office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| None of us seated here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| had any official dealings with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3148)|

| 0:52:53| I have members of his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| this is the reason that we've been lingering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| at trying to get the presentation made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3179)|

| 0:53:08| and I'd like to ask the members of the family to identify themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3188)|

| 0:56:36| You know, it's funny saying Dr. Bennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| I grew up with Rodney. He was a couple of years younger than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| But we both grew up in Mount Olive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| And, you know, you kind of hear this term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| but truly at an early, early age, I knew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| I think a lot of other people, I know my pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Reverend Dr. W.T. Crutcher knew at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| that great things were going to be in store for Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3417)|

| 0:57:03| being the pulpit assistant that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| ran the services there in Mount Olive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| But I know if it was teen, it was early teen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| it was probably pre-teen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| So he had and has the leadership abilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| that I knew that great things were going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| in store for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| You know, it's one of those families that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| gave me the unction and the will to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3447)|

| 0:57:33| a great educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| I actually taught at the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| I never had the opportunity to take her class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=3459)|

| 1:23:01| Do we know if we got the insurance certification in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| if it matched our needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| I know that was something we were working on last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Hold the microphone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4990)|

| 1:23:12| The certificate of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| For whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I wasn't here last week, and I'm sorry I'm having to ask you these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Are you talking about billing for the flu shots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Flu mist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Are we able to bill for the flu mist on insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Have we ever done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| It has nothing to do with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Is this not the contract that we were working on last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| There were several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| The only contract I'm aware of is the staffing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Maybe that's what I'm thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| That's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| This is a staffing contract to supplement so that our entire staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| doesn't have to leave and not do TB and STD services during flu mist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| So that's what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| And these companies are all appropriately bid and vetted through the bidding process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Are you good, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| The next item is Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| It's designating, committing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| and appropriating funds in the total amount of $3,825,574.10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| One call this afternoon, and I'd forgotten that I had the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| but I need to ask a question, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| A constituent question about the clerk's office move or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| First off, they said the font was really small, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| It's intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Clerk's office move or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| Under the county clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| there are monies designated for a potential move in Halls and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5123)|
| 1:25:34| It's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| They're just exploring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| and so what we do is we set aside some money because it would affect the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| and the trustee's office and maybe even a sheriff's piece in Halls, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| And so we set that aside, and if the move does occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| then these monies would be used for renovating the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| So I don't know for sure if it's going to happen, but just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| So is this to then broach the question, is the Halls office to be closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| No, it won't be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| In the first case, it would be relocated, but that's to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Still some service in Halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Discussion ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| That allows the constituents then to enter their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5189)|

| 1:30:19| Let's go on the back page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| The County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| 7-F-15-SP is a request of County Commission to initiate a northwest city sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5422)|

| 1:31:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| 7-D-15-RZ, request of Bell Investment Company, Incorporated, for rezoning from A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5473)|
| 1:31:22| and RA Low Density Residential to PR Plan Residential at a density up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| The property is located northwest side of East Emory Road, northeast of Morris Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5488)|
| 1:31:37| We know the applicant is here, and I think we're well aware the opposition is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| So let's go ahead and have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| Is there anybody from the Neighborhood Association, the Homeowner Association that's designated to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| What we'll do is allow the applicant to speak, and we'll allow equal time on both sides, and we'll just however long the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| Mr. King, can you do it in 10 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| Is that a billable hour for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| It's a billable hour or any part thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| What we'll do is we'll start with 10 minutes and just see kind of where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| We'll make sure both sides are even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, John King, Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5545)|
| 1:32:36| This is sort of an unusual thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| You all have done this before, but it is a little bit unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| What we have here is a request for zoning that can't really be acted on due to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| that the request for the plan amendment was turned down at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| What needs to happen here in order to get to the point of considering the request for rezoning to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5579)|
| 1:33:09| at 12 units to the acre is to have this body initiate a request for planned amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| in essence sending that to a planning commission for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| You put the proposed rezoning on hold, postpone it, until MPC acts on your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5602)|
| 1:33:33| and that comes back before you, and then you have something that you can consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| so to speak, on the merits of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| Now, that may be a gross oversimplification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| and I can ask that the law director add anything to that as far as explaining sort of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| and then I'm going to make some points about the request that I'm going to ask that you all make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5635)|
| 1:34:05| and that request would be, as I said, to send it back to MPC for action on your request for a planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5645)|
| 1:34:20| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| I don't know that this is becoming more and more common as we consider these sector plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| to initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| We've done several of them, but you do have the authority to initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| and send that to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| They have to act on it within 60 days, and it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| It's not unlike the item that we just considered and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| On the issue, and I'm going to leave the podium for a moment, but I'll speak up loudly, hopefully, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| Normally they don't have a problem hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| I frequently hear the groans from those behind me as I'm speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| so I think obviously everybody must be able to hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5704)|
| 1:35:12| Commissioner McKenzie, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Well, I guess my only concern would be that, is this being recorded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| Yes, but I don't think we have a floating mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| We'll have to improvise, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| We could ask Justin if he can hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5730)|
| 1:35:40| If you look at the staff report from MPC, right at the very first of their recommendations, NPR land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5740)|
| 1:35:53| it says higher intensity uses along Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| Hey, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| We're going to have to go ahead and move the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Let me go back down here and then I'll point it out what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| Why don't we move that down there because it doesn't sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| What the recommendation says, in analyzing their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| is that higher intensity uses along Emory Road are proposed to be located at the I-75 interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5775)|
| 1:36:30| the Dry Gap Pike intersection, and then on out at Hall's Crossroads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| which is really not necessarily involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| What I did on these maps, the first one in essence shows in green highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| where the property that we proposed for this rezoning is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| I'm going to introduce this and leave it here for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| What it does show is that virtually everything from the I-75 interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| to the point where this property is located on the north side of Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| virtually everything between that interchange and this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| with the exception of one property I'm going to talk about, is already built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| When we talk about locating it at those interchanges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| those interchanges are already developed out with that intensity, if you will, of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| So there's nothing there available for a project such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| That other one piece of property on the north side is between us and the interchange at I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5858)|
| 1:37:50| The front portion of that property, about a third of it in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| is already zoned CA for commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| which sort of takes it out of the equation for a proposed residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| So essentially in reality what you have is everything is developed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| or already rezoned for a higher intensity use from the interchange to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5890)|
| 1:38:20| I don't think as a consequence of that you're going to see any so-called ripple effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| of producing a whole bunch of medium density residential in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| This is essentially the last remaining piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| and it is as close to, for example, the intersection of Dry Gap Pike as we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| and as close to the interchange area at I-75 as we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5923)|
| 1:38:58| You will see, that's the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| Down here is the interchange, and if any of you are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| I'm going to start this over here and you can just pass it down to Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| The lady was taking all this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5951)|
| 1:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5969)|
| 1:39:44| On the board that's up on the easel now, red is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| You can see the commercial all around the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| As you go to the right, or to your right on that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| you'll hit another section that is red, not quite as large as the I-75 interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| That's Dry Gap Pike, and you will see the commercial around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| And I think this shows a little bit better what some of the zoning around the area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| It goes anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| There's one location right there at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| It's ten units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| There are some other locations that show on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| Nine dwelling units to the acre, five dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| I think there's one in there in an area of six units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| On past us and to the south of Emory Road, along Bricky Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6038)|
| 1:40:46| is a fairly substantial area that is zoned RB, which, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| can be developed with up to 12 units to the acre without any plan even being submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| Yes, there are low-density developments around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| but at the same time there's a, if you will, a mix of housing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| And I think this board shows that, in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| this piece of ground is pretty much the only piece of ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| that is currently available for a higher-intensity residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| which is what my client proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| I don't see the sense in talking about the actual rezoning proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6088)|
| 1:41:37| and the density issues and why and what the rental rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| and all that kind of stuff will be until such time as I can get a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| if you will, some sense of commission as to whether you are willing to send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| on a plan amendment request so that you can then really consider the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| So that's where I am at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| and I'm going to just make a couple of points when I get up here to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| and then I'll do the same and pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6132)|
| 1:42:24| That's the I-75 interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| Note all the commercial and the zoning designations and classifications are on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| so you can look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| This would be Dry Gap High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Right along this area would be Hedegoe Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| Here is our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| The property that I mentioned that's between us and the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| about the same size, that has a portion of its own CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6170)|
| 1:42:59| is that piece right there with, as I say, a portion of it already rezoned for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6179)|
| 1:43:08| The remaining in the rear is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6188)|
| 1:43:16| How many acres is this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Seventeen acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| The proposed sign is 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6206)|
| 1:43:39| I was here earlier talking with another gentleman who has, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| been faced with zoning decisions himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| He observed and made me recall that I've been doing this a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| and I suppose as a result you become a bit of a historian as to some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| I can remember, as he mentioned, times in the past when this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| perhaps composed of different members, but at least this body was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| no, we don't want to do anything in this area until the road is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| until the road has been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| Then we can consider all of these alternative uses at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| Well, that point in time is now the road has been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| It's five lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| We have direct access to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| That is the access we propose to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| We propose not to access the adjoining neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| nor do we agree that putting traffic through that adjoining neighborhood is the proper thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6289)|
| 1:45:00| We have access directly to Emory Road, and it makes more sense to access it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6300)|
| 1:45:07| We have said that if this body ultimately feels that there needs to be some sort of an access other than that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6307)|
| 1:45:19| for purposes of emergency vehicles or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| we don't oppose the idea that it could have such a limited use and purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6324)|
| 1:45:34| and we do not propose and do not agree with any proposal to access the adjoining neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6334)|
| 1:45:44| I think there's been a lot of concern expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| I've read a lot of e-mails and heard conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| and I think I don't believe I've read one that didn't mention that as a point of concern or opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6350)|
| 1:46:01| I'm here to assure that if ultimately we're permitted to go forward with this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| there will be no access to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| I don't believe this body ultimately, this body would approve that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6373)|
| 1:46:22| and if it is imposed as a condition and that's the final decision from which no appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| or an unreasonable appeal might remain, we would simply not build the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| We feel that strongly about not accessing the adjoining neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6398)|
| 1:46:46| Having said that, what I guess I need at this point before any more presentation or conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| is some sense of commission as to whether or not this body is willing to send its request for a plan amendment to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6413)|
| 1:47:06| so that the rezoning can then be properly considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| What MPC did, as a final note, what MPC did was decline to amend the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6431)|
| 1:47:19| and they voted to rezone the property to plan residential at five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6439)|
| 1:47:28| and that will not permit us to develop the project that we have on proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| Before we do that, I think it would be appropriate, number one, to hear from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| and I want to talk to MPC just for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| When was the road completed, and when was the sector plan completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6466)|
| 1:47:55| Oh, I'm sorry. Let me ask Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| The Emory Road, MPC's report indicates that the expansion of Emory Road to five lanes occurred before 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6479)|
| 1:48:08| and the update to the North County sector plan was a consideration when the recommendation for LDR for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6488)|
| 1:48:18| So the road was already improved, and then the sector plan was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6498)|
| 1:48:27| I think the road was improved prior to the last adoption of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6507)|
| 1:48:36| They're close together, but I think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| Ma'am, if you want to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6524)|
| 1:48:52| And I'll need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Yes, sir. Sarah Johnson, 7717 Dan Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| All right. And so far, the applicant has 16 minutes, and so you will get at least that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| I don't think I need that much, but we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Pull the mic a little bit closer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Basically, an amendment of the sector plan for this piece of property is absolutely outside of what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6549)|
| 1:49:20| Every piece of property that touches this piece of property is zoned low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| Most importantly, Emory Road was expanded prior to the consideration of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| So that's been a consideration already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| So to add that as a consideration to amend at this point in time I think is absolutely outside the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| not to mention the fact that Emory Road is five lanes, but there's been significant sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| We've had a lot of damage to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| There's been a fatal accident actually within the past week on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| So to add significant vehicle traffic on top of what's already there, especially with 200-something units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6596)|
| 1:50:04| I think that's we definitely agree that that's outside the scope of what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| Medium-density residential is intended to be a transitional zoning between commercial and low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6611)|
| 1:50:21| And like I said, this property is completely surrounded by low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| In fact, Emory Estates was zoned to be three units per acre, and it was actually constructed at 1.2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| And the other developments that touch the property were zoned at four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| and they were constructed at significantly less, at 2.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| To place 12 dwelling units per acre in between an average of 1.85 units per acre is outside of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6645)|
| 1:50:55| and outside of the intent of the zoning plan that's in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| and any amendment to be against that would not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| We also have significant opposition, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| I think everybody here is opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| 155 signatures on a petition for Emory Estates alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| That does not include the Trent Valley Lane and Derry Lane petitions against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| The bottom line here, an amendment to the sector plan does not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| To place that in the middle of something that's low-density residential all around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| with one access point in and out of Emory Road, according to the MPC's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| if there are more than 150 units, a secondary access point is likely to be recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6698)|
| 1:51:45| Whether or not that's an access point that can always be accessed or if it's just for emergency vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| that's something that Emory Estates cannot handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| We have a 90-degree turn when you come into the subdivision, 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| That cannot handle any more traffic than is already on that piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6718)|
| 1:52:08| The MPC recommended five dwelling units per acre with the planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| We would like to suggest a maximum of 2.8 to 3.1 units per acre at planned residential or low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6734)|
| 1:52:24| That falls in line with the surrounding properties and that falls in line with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| and the intent of the board when the sector plan was placed in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6748)|
| 1:52:40| Also, you may be aware of something that happened in Farragut, similar to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| It actually has to do with a very similar situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| a piece of property trying to be rezoned for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| If a sector plan amendment is put into place that's outside of the scope of what should happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| or if rezoning is granted in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| there's potential for future action from other developers that are looking to amend something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| that is out of place and not in line with the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| Bottom line is the closest piece of commercial property to this piece of land is quite a ways away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| so there's no way that this is the intent of the transition from the commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| to low-density residential for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| That doesn't make sense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Not to mention there's significant property across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| and around this property that's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| This does not make sense to be in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Does anybody else have anything they'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| I think that's all the opposition has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| So the plan amendment was turned down by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| You can't change a zoning without changing a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Right, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Yes, Commissioner, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| I just wondered if you'd changed it since I was on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| Anyway, I don't understand why that they would send this back to us the way they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6863)|
| 1:54:37| without some recommendation on the sector plan other than to say, you know, it's turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| If they're going to turn one down, how can they come back and recommend changing it to five units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6884)|
| 1:54:53| I mean, how can they legally do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| Gerald Green again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| That density is permitted in the low-density residential sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| and therefore the recommendation was to rezone it to allow a density of five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| but not to change the sector plan to a medium-density designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| What's the site distance at the entrance plan to this unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| John, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| At this point, I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| That will be determined when we get to the zoning aspect and the concept plan that comes with that use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6927)|
| 1:55:40| Just looking at it preliminarily, there is a sufficient site distance at that point of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| but I can't tell you today precisely what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| To elaborate a little bit on what Mr. Green said, you know, they didn't amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6954)|
| 1:56:02| and they did set the density of the rezoning to be planned residential at five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6962)|
| 1:56:10| which is still considered low-density, so that recommendation is all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| If this body sends back its request for their recommendation on sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6976)|
| 1:56:25| to put that plan at medium-density residential for this property, whatever action they take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6985)|
| 1:56:34| whether they approve it or decline to approve it, it still comes back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| It's a process that's the result of a judicial decision that none of us like, but we have to deal with it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7001)|
| 1:56:52| So you are right that you can't set a zoning classification higher than five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7012)|
| 1:57:02| unless you do amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| Well, in other words, Mr. Green, what are the limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| I can understand going PR because you've got to come back with a plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7032)|
| 1:57:19| and that's why that's set up, to come back with a plan review to protect the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| What's the minimum and the max on the plan PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| If the zoning is PR with this sector plan recommendation for land use of low-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| the density ranges of one dwelling unit per acre to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| Five is the maximum under this designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| If we decided this should be two, it could still be PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| Okay, that was my main point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| So anything up to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| I do live in that area out there, and I've got a lot of input from the people around in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| First of all, Mr. King, I appreciate what you said up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| You did misplace Pedigo Road on your map when you were showing it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| It's a little bit farther east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| So, anyway, I just thought I'd correct that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| If you look at the residents around there, what you were talking about was Morris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| and Dairy Lane and that area up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| And when I was on MPC, I used to drive around to every site that we had any complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| or any concerns about to see what really fit on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| Now, we're not against zoning and apartments being developed in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| because we passed the zoning up here before and talked to the people out in the 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| and were successful in getting that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| However, this fits into what we call uncharacteristic zoning in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7136)|
| 1:59:04| if we go with what they want here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| So, in looking at all the area around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| and keeping our community in the same type character it is now and what is around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| I'm ready to make a motion if we can do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| I'd like to make a motion that we leave the zoning at low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| between 2.8 and 3.1 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| Did I hear there was a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| There was, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Before you take an official vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| could I get a show of hands of those who are likely to support that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| when your vote is called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| I may save some time this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| I don't know if he's in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| I don't know if that would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| I take it that my request is out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| There's a lot of hands behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| I think I'll tell you where I stand on rezoning somebody's property without coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| because the owner of the property is actually not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| and if we set that zoning, it's set no matter what the owner asks for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| and I don't think that's proper to change his zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| by lowering his request without him being here to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| and I'm assuming that Mr. King is going to say deny it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| He doesn't want the vote to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| but I feel very uncomfortable by resetting somebody's zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| and them not wanting that zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| He's representing him, isn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| But I'm sitting here telling you he's going to say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| and so I don't think it, and if we vote it, it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| and I don't think that's proper for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| Yeah, I tend to agree, and my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| I'm assuming that he was present at the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| so he understood the five was coming from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| Yes, I was there representing the applicant at Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| to make my position clear rather than to have a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| the effect of which is then ultimately to lead to a rezoning of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| at five dwelling units an acre or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| I would withdraw the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| So based on Mr. Bussler's motion, I can't get a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| About one or two more of you speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| and tell me what you're thinking you might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| It would probably be enough for me to get the drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| Commissioner Onbe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| I'll go ahead and tell you, in my opinion, you'd be best to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| but that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| Yeah, Mr. King, I would suggest you withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| I'm going with these fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| I don't think it's good to put that many units in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| They bought their houses out there under that residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| and I don't think it's fair to change another plan again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| We've done that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| Commissioner, given the spirit of conversation that I've heard thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7342)|
| 2:02:35| and being where I am, I think at this time I would say that we'd like to withdraw our request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7355)|
| 2:02:46| for rezoning, and the plan has already been dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| so you don't have to do anything except approve my withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| Commissioner Bussler, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| I guess we have to withdraw the motion to speak to the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| since he withdrew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| So I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| And he second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| Do you have a motion to approve the withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| We have a motion and a second for withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| which will put it right back to where MPC put it at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| No, withdrawal of the whole application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| Withdrawal, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| It stays as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Would you have a question, then, if it's, can I ask Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| If that's withdrawn, what time frame can that be reapplied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| You'd address the question to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| I'm standing here, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| Since the request is withdrawn, and I'll admit I'm new at this in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7427)|
| 2:03:54| and no less than I've been, Mr. King, probably on many issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| it's withdrawn and no action taken by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| He could request a rezoning to something different at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| Something similar would be one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| This request or something, I believe the words are substantially similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| are prohibited for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| Otherwise, he could come in and ask for something totally different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| or modify this idea or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| It's the same as it, if you were to deny it, for example, it's still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| It would be a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| And then just one other question for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| I appreciate your staff planner, Mr. Reynolds, including in the document the general comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7481)|
| 2:04:48| that were referenced by Ms. Johnson about what the actual dwelling units per acre were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| that were built out in the adjoining properties at the 2.5 and then the 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| But I appreciate that staff member adding that to the general comments category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| where some of your staff don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| So I appreciate Mr. Reynolds doing that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| I'll let you know and we'll make that a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| I appreciate your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| Motion is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| That's all the business we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| I need to make a couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| One, I'm in receipt of correspondence from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| on the Northeast County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| The second round of meetings will be Thursday, September 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| Monday, September 21st, Tuesday, September 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| Let me give those dates again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| This is the second round of Northeast County Sector Plan revisitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7553)|
| 2:06:00| or whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| the 10-year relook at sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| Thursday, September 17th, Monday, September 21st, Tuesday, September 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7566)|
| 2:06:14| All those meetings are from 6 to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| Corrington Senior Citizen Center, Gibbs Ruitan Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| and the East Knox County Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| It really plays into what we're talking to about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| how sector plans are modified for use at rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| And then one last thing, from the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| Kevin Murphy now is the member of Board of Zoning Appeals for the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| He will be before us unless I have another candidate to identify themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| or Mr. Murphy does not want to participate on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| I envision that he will be appointed to a second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| At the conclusion of this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| it will represent the first full year of my service on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| along with some of the other new guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| I just want to say I feel very honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| and privileged to represent the people of the 3rd District in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| and publicly thank every one of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| for how open and receptive they've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| We always haven't voted the same way on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| but I always feel like we have respect for each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7652)|

| 2:07:37| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| This is the last meeting that our chairman is going to preside over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| and I think he's done an admirable job in the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| and the year before I wasn't here, but we appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150824?start=7665)|
