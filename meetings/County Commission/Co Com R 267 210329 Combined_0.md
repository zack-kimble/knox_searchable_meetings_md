| 0:10:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| You've never been caught, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Yes, it's my first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=634)|

| 0:10:38| or do you just rely on your bartenders to look at their sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=642)|

| 0:11:04| $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=664)|

| 0:11:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| When we went into the business, we requested their server certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Since it is a bar, they could not provide any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| and were told to bring their server certificates today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Do you have those on hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| It looks like she's bringing them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| She's bringing them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That was our question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Can you check those before we go forward with this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| make sure that you have everything that's needed to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=697)|
| 0:11:59| So she's the defendant in the criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| She brought her certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| but that's not obviously everyone that works at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| So you requested all certificates for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| We received a complaint about January about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| and that's why we requested it at the time of the offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| so they don't have them on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| How many employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=748)|

| 0:13:44| Jodi Winkle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| I know she's got her, but she's not here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| If you guys could speak into the mic, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| We've just got to be able to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| They said that Jodi Winkle also works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| There should be one more employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Wanda Bales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Wanda Bales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| So those two aren't present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| We don't have their server certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I'll look back to Commissioner Daley if you want to amend your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| I'll amend my motion that it's still the $1,000 for 30-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| and that will start the day that you bring the server certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| So you've got to get those two other server certificates to the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| and then you're not selling beer right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| So until you get those server certificates, you cannot open back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| And I do remember the case two or three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| I got an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| I think you let one of your servers go, and she called in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| and wanted me to do it because you had no servers that were trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I do remember the occasion that the sheriff's office is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| But that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| You'll get a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension, your choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| but it will not take effect until you get the other two certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So you cannot sell beer until you come down here and get the other two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| So he is not allowed to sell beer until the other two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| We want to get some guidance from our law director first here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Is it possible that we could defer suspension until, say, noon on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| if they get the copy to the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Otherwise, at noon on Friday, they have a 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| That would have to be Thursday because it's Good Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Oh, excuse me, Thursday at noon because that would give them 48 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| Yeah, this beer board can do what it deems best equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| So, yes, that's possible you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Would you like to get that by Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| That paperwork by Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| I'll amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| John, you make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| John, you make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Okay, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Would you need to see, the sheriff's department need to see a copy of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| We just need to verify, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| And we probably would go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| You have one light on if you want to add some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| And we can make the effort to meet Mr. Romine's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| He doesn't have to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| We just need to see those certificates in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Okay, yeah, that'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Commissioner Busser, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Officer, do we have one certificate there that shows somebody could serve beer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| She can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| She can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Hers is in date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| She can serve it, but nobody else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| And I don't know how we would, I don't know, police that, say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| Well, we can make an effort to get by Daniel's Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| It is open today, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Is the bar open today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Then we can make an effort to get out there and check those certificates today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| I know, but there is one person there that can serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| She's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| But she's the only one, and she's not there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| And what I'm saying is when she's there, she can serve it, but nobody else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Unless they have those certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| We just need to see the certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| But if she does have that, she can serve beer there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| That's up to the board unless they suspend their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I just want to make sure that, you know, if they have one person there that can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| but that's the only person that could serve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and if they get caught again without that, then we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| I just don't want the business to be shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| if you've got somebody there that can serve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| and has the legal title to serve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| I don't know if you can do with that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| but it just takes you so you're completely shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| when you do have at least one person there that's legally to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| I'd like to make a motion that we allow the applicant or the offender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| until noon on Thursday to produce the other two certificates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| and the $1,000 fine will still be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| If those certificates are not rendered by noon on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| then there will be a suspension of their beer license with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| For what period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| For 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Excuse me, for the period until they can present the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| and the Sheriff's Department is saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| So the motion is to find the offender $1,000 regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1137)|
| 0:19:10| and they have until noon on Thursday to produce to the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| all the certificates of all the servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| If they are unable to do that, they will also receive a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| until they are able to produce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| They will not be able to serve beer until they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| And the Sheriff's Office would have to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I'm going back to what I believe Commissioner Fustler was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| The owner of this bar could fire those two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| that don't have their certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| The owner of this bar could fire those two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| that don't have their certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| or could tell them not to serve beer, not allow them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| I don't think we can shut somebody down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| as long as they have someone that is legally able to sell product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1199)|
| 0:20:08| Director Boote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I agree with Commissioner Fustler and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I mean, the owner can decide, I've only got one server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| and as long as that's the person pulling the beer, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| But the sheriff is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Nobody else can be pulling the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| That's what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| He wants to make sure that that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| And if this young lady that's here, she's got her certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| and she's the one that's pulling the beer, then he's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| So I agree with that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Can you state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| My name is Carlton Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| I'm an attorney with the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I live at 3042 McCammon Road out in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| I made note of the two names that they claim have the server certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| and I note that they were sworn to tell the truth prior to their testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| That may become an issue, too, if we don't have one for Jody Winkle or Wanda Bales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| I'm just advising the beer board of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Yes, Mr. Bryan, is that the names that you have, or is that two different names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| That's the names that they just gave the beer board just now was Jody Winkle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| and Wanda Bales are the other two servers that supposedly have certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| So there's a motion currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| I'll clarify the motion that, just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| they have until Thursday to produce the other server certificates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| and then it will be a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Then after Thursday at 12.01, it's a $1,000 fine plus suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Any further discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Is that clear to you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Yes, and I'll verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| We'll get that taken care of today or tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| and I'll get with Kathy and make sure she has copies of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| And the Sheriff's Office, we're relying on you all to go out, not only engage, get those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| but also report back if there are any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| If for some reason there are people that don't have certificates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| if somebody's pulling beer, you need to come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| and we're certainly able to call another session to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| and not wait until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Director Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| I've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Your microphone, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| I do have a problem with suspending his license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| if the only person pulling beer is the one that's got her certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| I mean, he may only be able to work eight hours or six or something with one server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| but you shouldn't suspend him if he's got a licensed certified server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| I mean, it's like Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| He could fire two employees and operate with one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| but if the sheriff catches a non-certified server, that's Katie bar the doors then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1391)|
| 0:23:20| But until then, I don't think that that motion can stand that way by saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| if those other two server certificates aren't produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| he can no longer pull beer as long as that young lady who is certified is the one pulling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| I'll look to Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Would you like to amend your motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| I'll make a motion that the $1,000 fine stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and that the Knox County Sheriff's Department will visit the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| to affirm that the other two servers are certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| If that is not accomplished and they don't have certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| then we will have an option to call an emergency beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| Okay. Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I don't have any further comments given the change in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Commissioner Daly, do you want to stay with that second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| That is a $1,000 fine, and then essentially if there's other wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| then they'll come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| But right now the only motion is basically a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Is it necessary to call an emergency meeting, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Well, if they have people serving beer that aren't certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| then I would think the Sheriff's Department would not be very comfortable with that, nor should we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| But you still would have one, this young lady right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| I know, but is she going to be working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| I'm saying if they're not turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| I think the intent from the legal counsel of the Sheriff's Department is they've testified that this is who it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| and if for some reason that's not the case and they're still serving and other people are serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| then they may come back to us, and if we feel like we need to bring it up, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| If not, we can do it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| I'm sorry, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| What was your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Jory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| She just showed me a picture of her mom's server certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| It matches hers, which would be Jody Winkle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| She does have her server certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| We're waiting on Wanda Bell's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| So we're trying to clear it up as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| So the motion right now is for a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Mr. Romines, do you understand what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| The simple solution is to deal with this violation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| The Sheriff's Department can go back and check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| and they can see if everyone serving has a certificate at a future date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| and then that will come back as a second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Any further discussion on item number 5C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| It's a motion on the table by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| with a second by Commissioner Daley for a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1571)|

| 0:26:16| and work with the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| and good luck with your business going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=1581)|

| 0:33:45| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Proceed, Officer Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2027)|

| 0:33:54| Knox County Sheriff's Office sent an underage person into A1 Tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| The person was able to purchase alcoholic beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| and exit the business with the beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| They did check the ID, but the person is only 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Did you hear and understand the allegation, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Would you like to offer anything else to this beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| I'd just like to say that on October 29, I was working at my store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| I work at my store three, four nights a week on October 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| and they came in and I passed the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Three months later, they're in there checking me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| How many times do I have to pass the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I owned the Quick Service Mart for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| and they never came in there a single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I understand there's got to be accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| but I just passed the test on October 29, and they're right back down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| and they got me under 30 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| These girls, they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| They don't care about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| I beg them to check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| I beg them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| I've got all the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2099)|

| 0:35:01| I beg them to check the IDs, and they just don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I mean, they thought, you know, I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I've got every tool you can ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| I've got the little card reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2108)|

| 0:35:14| No, you know, I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I beg them to check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| I beg them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| I'll defer to the commission now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Before I call on the district commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker just had some additional information he wanted to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Just for the record, according to the Knox County Clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| the first offense occurred in March of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| The second offense occurred in March of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| And now the third offense is February of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| I'll look to District 8 Commissioner, Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I'll defer to the at-large commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Yes, sir, I'd like to make a motion for a $1,500 fine and a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| There's a first by Commissioner Biggs for a $1,500 fine plus a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| And there's a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Is there additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Sir, how long have you owned this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| You personally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| 2005, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Is there additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| First, every time somebody comes in and buys a beer, it's a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| Any time somebody comes in to buy a beer, it's a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| It doesn't have to be one of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| It's a test to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| As someone whose family used to own a business, I can sympathize with you on how hard it is to get help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| to take the same type of consideration and concern as the owner does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| And part of the problem, as I've stated before, is there's no consequences for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| They take a job, and I think it's a $50 fine for them if they're caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| I've often asked why we can't level the field a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| If you hire someone and tell them that they're going to get fined $500 if they sell beer to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| I'm sure they'll do a much better job than knowing that they can do it and it falls on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| So I sympathize with you, but our rules are our rules, and I will be voting in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| That's going to take away my livelihood if you take my license for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I have no way to make money, you know, feed my family and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Over some girl that she'd been there three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| I mean, she'd been there three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| I showed her all the processes, begged her to check the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I mean, there's nothing else I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| I passed the test 10, 15, 20 times since I've been selling beer since I was 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| I passed it every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I'm the license holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I mean, I'm responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I mean, these girls come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I don't, you know, beg them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| I beg them, freaking beg them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| I mean, I have no way to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| You take my beer license away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| It's the only thing I know how to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Since we're on this, one of my ninth districts said the same thing that what Randy just said, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2314)|
| 0:38:43| Mr. Law Director, is this a state fine or is this a county fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Can we look at it to change that rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| It's not state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| You have discretion under your beer ordinance to do basically whatever you please with regard to fines up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2333)|
| 0:39:05| In lieu of suspension, you have suspensions, and you have within our ordinance there are some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| Mr. Law Director, he's telling us that in reference to the license holder or the employee he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| No, there's nothing we can do with the employee under our thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| All there is, and I think that Officer Lawson, when he cites these people for the fine, it's a state law, and it's taken up in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2368)|
| 0:39:38| Yes, I mean, they get a criminal record out of it, so it's not like they're skirting just by pushing up on the business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2378)|
| 0:39:47| I see where he's coming from, but, you know, that's handled through the courts, not through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| Do you know, is it a misdemeanor criminal record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| It is a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| They can use their diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| It can be expunged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Is there any type of fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| That's through the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I'm not sure what they would fine, but, you know, $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| After court costs, they probably pay about $225 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| This is Director to our Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Have there been any other problems at that establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| I've never had any problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Just the violations that we've recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| I haven't pulled call history to see if anything else has went on there, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| And, Mr. Law Director, what was it that you started to say about options for a beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| You have options that are virtually unlimited within certain limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| You can fine up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| You can suspend, and usually it's in lieu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| The money is in lieu of a suspension of so many days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| You can't fine more than $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Now, there's a table of possible suggested, which by its own terms are discretionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| and we pretty much don't really follow those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| But precedent shows on first offense, it's 30 days or $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Take your pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| But this board has a lot of leeway with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| Is there additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| So I want to restate there's a motion by Commissioner Biggs for a $1,500 fine plus 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2494)|
| 0:41:43| That is seconded by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| So we have one pass, Commissioner Hill, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| So that's 10-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Let's pass with your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| And if you would get with the clerk's office to arrange for that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| I'm sorry, get with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| You're suspending my license for two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| The beer board has decided to suspend your license for 60 days and impose a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| I ain't got no way to make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| I'm going to shut my store down over something some woman did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I've been there three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I'm held responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Sir, may I suggest you change your hiring practices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| There's no bachelor's degrees down there that are required for my job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| I mean, I pay $10 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| I don't get the best of the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| But you do understand that you have a history of selling from your business to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| Not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| I'm the beer holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| I've passed the test 15 times, 20 times since I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I mean, it's easy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| These people don't care about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| I don't know what else I'm supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| How am I going to stop it happening again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I mean, who can I hire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Who's out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| They don't have college degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| I mean, I don't make $50,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| You're going to take my license away for two months over something some woman did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| I mean, that's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Okay, see the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Commissioner Bitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Commissioner Bussard, did you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Going back to the server end of it right here, I was going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| was the person that served the beer, did they have a license to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| We don't check their server permits when they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| That's something we should probably start doing in the future, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| The reason we checked Daniel's bar is we received a formal complaint through our tip line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| But I was just wondering if that's the case, if that individual that's serving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| is there a penalty for serving it that you have a server's license and you . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| That would be handled through General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| So they could take their server's license away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| That would be up to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Commissioner Bix, do you want to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I would just like to make a quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| We have actually heard Lieutenant Lawson and Chief Brant state that they are not tricking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| These are state-issued Tennessee licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| This was the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| And in actuality, whenever I spoke to Director Buch, it's actually 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| We gave him a break of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| The next offense, the fourth offense, that's a one-year suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| So I just wanted that to be read in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| You guys are doing an amazing job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I wanted to ask you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| On this particular person you sent in, did they have the ID that either had the red line or is upside down, sideways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I don't know what his license looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I can have him send me a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| He is 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| He works in our jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| No, I just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Some of them have that red strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Some have the red line, and some of the new ones are printed sideways, which make it, I think, fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| Unfortunately, suspended and revoked licenses are printed the same way as an underage person, so they may not look at those either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| They need to come up with a different complete color scheme for someone under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| Since alcohol and tobacco are both now under 21, that would be the easiest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| We're going to move on to applications, item number six on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| We'll start with item number 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Madam Clerk, if you would, please read that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2750)|

| 0:46:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2788)|

| 0:46:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Or just yell, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| I've got to get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2812)|

| 0:47:09| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=2829)|

| 0:52:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Let's skip over that for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Is there a reason he's not here since he's going to be the one operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| He had to go out of town today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| This is vacant land that is set to close, and he is here seeking the conditional approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| And there's no building on the land right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| There's no building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Moving on to the reports from the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Pending inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| The applicant, Mr. Karani, we visited one of his businesses on March the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| It's in Farragut, 800 North Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| and he does have a violation this board would be unfamiliar with because they do report to the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| But that's the only violation on 3821.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| What is the violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Underage beer sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| He was not the person that sold the beer, but, again, he's on his application here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| 800 North Campbell Station Road shows another business that he owned since 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| and it's an easy stop mark as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| But, again, that goes through the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| so this board would be unfamiliar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Pending certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Obviously since there's no building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| And the fire marshal the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| It's kind of a strange situation because the owner's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| but I turn it over to this board to consider all the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Commissioner Skinner-Maker, you had some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Law Director, I guess I'm a little uncomfortable issuing a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| to an applicant that's not present, and there's no building in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| so there's no rush to actually approve a beer permit for a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| that hadn't even been constructed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| So would it be better for this body to defer this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| until the owner can be present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I would think that would be the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| You know, somebody swearing under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| and having an agent swear for somebody is a little bit iffy in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| So I think deferral because he's not going to be out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| because he doesn't have a building yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| I'm too a bit bothered by the applicant not being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| and I understand he could be out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| but I'm further puzzled by the nature of trying to get a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| for a parcel of vacant land where a building's not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| Is it part of the contingency of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| He basically was seeking approval, conditional approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| just making sure that there was no problem selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| at this geographic location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Couldn't that not have been answered at MPC or codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| He tried multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| And based on his feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| he said that he did not get any concrete, any type of concrete answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| That should be a fairly simple thing to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| I thought so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I'm really uncomfortable with this also because no matter if you do it one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| you set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| And so if we do this, then we're opening ourselves up down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| for more of these applications like this to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| and to sell it, to have a beer license for a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| with nothing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| I don't see how we can do that legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| Commissioner Beeler, I will look to you as the District 8 representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Yeah, I don't know of any reason why a beer permit couldn't be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| at this location, but it's just an odd way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| And it's kind of an odd condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| So, I mean, since I don't normally take action on these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| I will look to my colleagues, but I would think this should be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| at such time that there's an actual physical location doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| before a beer permit should be applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| I'll make a motion to postpone for 30 days until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| I'll second Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| I'll second Commissioner Lundy, first by Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| I think you can understand why we don't want to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| because that puts you in a whole different ballgame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| and you've got to wait a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| But I think everybody's quite uncomfortable not having the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| We now have a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| It's a little clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| And I'm confident that as the broker and representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| if you contacted MPC and walked through with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| they could probably give you a very clear, distinct understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| of where things land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| As I said, I believe it's very possible to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| if a permit can be issued for the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Is this more of the potential buyer wanting to make sure they can get a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| because of some of their pending problems in Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| I was not aware of the problems in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| So I don't know how to answer that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| besides I don't know if that was his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Is your contract contingent upon the site being approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| or the person being approved for the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| It was the site being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Just an inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| If we postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| and the situation is still identical to what it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| I'm wondering if I might make a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| at such time that a foundation is poured or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| I mean, I'm very open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| According to what this gentleman is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| that they can't go through the sale of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| because in the agreement there's a contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| that they need to be able to get a beer permit before the sale goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| So I would like to talk to the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| and kind of iron out some more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| and talk to the owner and figure out a middle ground here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| where everybody's kind of more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| But there won't be a foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| and the sale won't go through without us passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| That's why I don't want to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3586)|

| 1:02:34| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3754)|

| 1:02:47| Ms. McCarty has a bit of a history of alcohol-related offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| On July 15th of last year, she had a DUI in Blount County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| with a blood alcohol content of .215.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| At that time, she fought with the police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| When you go further back in her history, she's got PIs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| a DUI that's been reduced to a reckless, and a DOC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3790)|

| 1:03:21| When you talk about moral turpitude, normally I think of ethical things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| but when I was looking in Black's Law Dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| one of the cases it quoted said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| an act of baseness or depravity in the private and social duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| which one person owes to another or society in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| And I would suggest that we owe a duty to society in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| to not get behind the wheel of a vehicle with a .215 blood alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| and that's our concern that we're bringing to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=3837)|

| 1:08:12| Seconded by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Is there further discussion on item number 6C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| There is a motion on the floor by Commissioner Ward to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| by the second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4101)|

| 1:08:27| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| It appears this motion denies based upon the moral turpitude clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| in a pending criminal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| The moral turpitude clause, how does that hold up in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| and how does pending litigation hold up in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| if we take action before resolution has come to that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Well, you're looking at the – there's no easy answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4134)|
| 1:09:02| The sheriff has expressed that office's concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| and that's what this board takes into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| Whether she's guilty or not, of course, is up to a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| I didn't hear that they said that they were making a decision for the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| They're just saying that these events took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| and that's why they consider the – in their opinion, the sheriff's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| they consider that an issue that this board should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| I don't have an easy answer one way or the other on the pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| The policy issue is up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Is it appropriate to amend my – after the ruling on the court case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| Is that appropriate, or have we done that historically or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| I don't believe we've been – I don't believe we, in recent history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| had a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Is it possible, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| Anything is really possible for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| You make the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| You vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I don't think there's anything in the ordinance that contemplates this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| I've never known it to happen in the nine years I've been around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| You could postpone it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I was going to say, could I postpone until the outcome of the trial has been concluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| I think, though, the deferrals need to be a time-certain deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| So I would pick a time date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| I would suggest picking a definitive time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| May I suggest asking Lieutenant Lawson and Mr. Brantlin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| do we have a specific docket or whenever it's supposed to appear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| As this board knows, courts are not moving along very quickly right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| That was a chemical test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| That was a blood alcohol test that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| regardless of what the finding is by the General Sessions Court or the criminal court in Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| there was a chemical test that was done on this lady's blood that showed she was operating a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| at 0.215 percent alcohol in her blood, and that's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| What's the legal limit, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| There's a presumption after 0.08 that you're impaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| Just anecdotally, I was a subject in our wet lab many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| I drink beer on occasion, and when I was at an 0.05, I would have never gotten in a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| At 0.07, they cut me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| So that's a significant amount of alcohol to be getting behind a wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4303)|

| 1:11:54| I'm not going to amend it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4318)|

| 1:21:29| took place on this very week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| The divide between religion and government had never been greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4893)|

| 1:22:02| The tension was palpable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4922)|

| 1:22:06| Riots were happening in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4926)|

| 1:22:17| Into that chaos came love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| Not merely love as an idea, but real love, intense love, immense love, divine love, robed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4942)|

| 1:22:48| and yes, even reconciliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| So as we look to this holy week, it's my prayer for each one of us that we would pause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=4972)|

| 1:24:56| First set the agenda, and we'll have two honorary resolutions and two presentations, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| get the education consent calendar out of the way, then we will hold our first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5103)|

| 1:25:21| We do have zoning at 7, so I'll look to this body to determine if we have some discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5121)|
| 1:25:29| between 3 minutes and 5 minutes for public speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| Is there some consensus among this body of whether or not to have 5 minutes or 3 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| with 17 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5138)|

| 1:25:51| give them 5, but if you've spoken, 3 minutes is plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| I'm not sure we'll be able to check the list of who's spoken or not, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5155)|

| 1:26:14| Stick with 3 minutes for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Then we will jump into the agenda as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5177)|

| 1:27:25| Consent Calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Then at the appropriate time, we make a motion to accept the Education Calendar and the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5246)|
| 1:27:36| to accept the General Consent Calendar as posted or as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5256)|

| 1:28:58| Is that a question or a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| A statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| That's what we're doing, and so I wanted them to take off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5340)|

| 1:29:17| So I'll just add those to the withdraws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=5357)|

| 1:45:38| You can see there was a drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| in the early months of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| which ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| those sales really just shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6344)|

| 1:45:54| see a downturn in the latter half of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6354)|

| 1:45:58| high. You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| so far in January and February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| home sales are well above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6362)|

| 1:46:16| to the financial crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6376)|

| 1:46:26| you see nationally, but still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| you can see that there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| a downward trend in active listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6390)|

| 1:46:36| sharpened. Like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| said, it's a historic low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6398)|

| 1:46:52| some interesting stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| The one-year price growth in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6414)|

| 1:47:26| or fairly big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| One in four said the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6448)|

| 1:47:50| but this is just based off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| census data. You can see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| it looks like housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| have followed along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6476)|

| 1:48:34| But employment growth was up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| almost 19%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6516)|

| 1:55:20| That alludes to the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| inventory below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6922)|

| 1:55:26| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| very, very scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Like I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| saying, the nature of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| the inventory is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| the crux of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| affordability issue in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Home prices have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| certainly risen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| That's mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| due to just increased demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| and lower mortgage rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| but the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| here is, and so you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| here, monthly mortgage payment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| for the same home today versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| one year ago, it's more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| because mortgage rates are lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| The problem is there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| virtually no inventory below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| $250,000 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| people to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| You've seen people slowly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| climbing up the ladder, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| taking on a house that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| is going to consume more of their monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| income than they would have if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| they had a $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| house to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| 4.8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| at the metro level was the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| growth, so it's cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| but that's trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| to underscore here that the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| is really a lack of inventory at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| lower levels, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| prices rising too quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| though they are rising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| pretty fast, and they're growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| much faster than household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| This is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| to expand upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| the racial disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| that I alluded to earlier, so you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| the white homeownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| rate in the Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| is 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| The black homeownership rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| is 37%, and again, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| lower than in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| and nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| and that is also true of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Asian and Hispanic homeownership rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| in Knoxville, though they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| not as pronounced as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| the black homeownership rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| Like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| before, we are seeing a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| share of black homebuyers in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Knoxville, though it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| not going to make up that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| at this current level. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| seeing some marked improvement, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| not quite there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| and it certainly will not make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| a 35 percentage point gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| We'll just skip this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| for the sake of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| This is just showing you that out-of-state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| homebuyers are an increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| share of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| The rental market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| new construction is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| approaching pre-2008 levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| and multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| building permits are sort of leading the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| charge here, but the rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| vacancy rate is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| very low in Knox County, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| we still need more rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| housing, we need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| single-family homes as well, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7098)|
