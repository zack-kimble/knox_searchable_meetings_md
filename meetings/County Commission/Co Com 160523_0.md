| 0:04:51| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Does he have to be sworn separately to make this all legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=292)|

| 0:05:18| We're talking about the B&M Lounge at 8508 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Is there any problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=322)|

| 0:05:26| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| We have before us an application for an on and off premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| and I move that it be approved pending a certificate of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| and also surrender of the outstanding license for current sales there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| Certification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| And certification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Is that correct, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Certification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| And we have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Was it on and off previously as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| So that didn't serve a problem or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| You don't think it will be a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| I think the thing that we rarely see that, I think, and it's an extra burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| so I'd be very careful with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| But we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| That is the question that is usually raised by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| in that a person may be there on premise and then get prepared to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| and you'll have to make a verification of the fact whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| or not they should be sold additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| So that is an additional burden of having both on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| Seeing no further discussion, the application is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=417)|

| 0:11:53| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| I wish to welcome everyone to this, the May meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| First item on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| And what I would like to comment to is in this past week, significant events occurred in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=732)|
| 0:12:21| That's the graduation of a lot of high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| I believe it started as early as last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| During our work session, as I refer to the School of Tomorrow, the Paul Kelly Academy graduated kids that may not have made it through high school in the normal, regular setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=750)|
| 0:12:50| I applaud the Board of Education in Knox County for their efforts to start that school and help those kids get a high school diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=770)|
| 0:13:02| Because even for simple things like, and it's significant, but joining the military, you have to have a high school diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=782)|
| 0:13:12| Also, since we had a meeting while the Paul Kelly was taking place, so I decided I'd go to the STEM Academy of Graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| I also attended Carter High School graduation and the Gibbs High School graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| And here at public forum, I'd like to recognize Superintendent of Knox County Schools, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| to speak for just a second about the importance of graduation in Knox County and where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=813)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jim McIntyre, 912 South K Street, Superintendent of Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| I don't believe I've spoken for a second on anything in my entire career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| I did want to just take the opportunity that the Chairman has given me to talk a little bit about the week that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=834)|
| 0:14:02| We did have 16 high school graduations, and then I had the honor and the privilege of attending all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| along with Ms. Cheryl Hickman and Mr. Danny Trent, who are our Director and Supervisor of Secondary Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| Each of those events is unique and special and wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| We had the opportunity to see somewhere in the neighborhood of about 4,000 students walk across the stage and get handed a diploma and shake our hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=861)|
| 0:14:31| Just a remarkable experience. We have the opportunity to see our students perform in a variety of settings, to give speeches that are just incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=871)|
| 0:14:44| We gave Hawk Awards and Panther Awards and Cherokee Awards and all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| We heard from Emily Ann Roberts, who graduated from Carnes High School, and just gave an incredible performance at her graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| More than anything else, this is the time when our students have done what we asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| when they have met our really rigorous academic standards and fulfilled our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| We celebrate their achievements, we celebrate their accomplishments, and we wish them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| It really did speak to just the incredible education that our teachers and our schools are providing to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| I want to thank Commissioner Wright and the Chairman for being at several of the graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| I think we had all of our school board members at at least one of our high school graduations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| and for all the community for coming out and supporting our kids. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| There is one more graduation, right? The Adult Education Program graduation this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| It is the last graduation of adult education that will soon be taken over the state, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| That's correct. The state will be taking over the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| They have named the E-Tech, the East Tennessee, I'm not even going to be able to tell you what the acronym is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=958)|
| 0:16:06| but the technical colleges for the state of Tennessee, which are going to take over the adult education in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=966)|
| 0:16:15| They will serve about a 15-county region. This will be our last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| From Monday morning, when we had the Knoxville Adaptive Education Center graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| which is, if you've never been to any graduation, you should go to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| These are students with disabilities who have had lots of struggles along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Their celebration is just extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Saturday night, at the end of the night, when Farragut High School Band plays Anchors Away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| we know we've sent our kids across the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| It's been a remarkable week, and thank you all for your support of our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre. Does anyone else wish to speak? Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| I'd just like to echo everything that you all said and put a shameless plug in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| If you've never been to Austin East's graduation, it really is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| The class is led in by the West African dancers and drummers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| and they always have a portion of the program that's done by the artists, a ballet and modern dance thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| It just says all graduations are unique because every educational experience is just a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| I think Knox County does an outstanding job of educating our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie. Does anyone else wish to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=1054)|

| 0:40:00| Yes, sir. I guess I'll make a motion to approve so we can get on the floor to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| All right. I want to talk, I guess Chris, we need to talk a little bit about the, if we're deferring the fee increase, you're going to be about $600,000 or $400,000 or $600,000 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| Is that going to just come over from undesignated fund balance if necessary at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| I think what we would do is this. Depending on what the commission does in June in regards to permit fees, if no action is taken, then we'll have to amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2420)|
| 0:40:36| If action is taken that meets the requirements for this document, then we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2436)|
| 0:40:45| I think we wait to see what is brought before you and what you all approve in June in regards to permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| All right. And going back to kind of the point I made in the work session, I just, you know, I think we've had as a commission have talked about employees and the importance of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2455)|
| 0:41:06| We always stand up here and praise and talk about the importance of employees and, you know, on the school side they're able to give them a 3% pay raise plus a step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| And we're still sitting on it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| And I just want to encourage the mayor's office and finance that, you know, in January if revenues are ahead of pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| I'd like for us to potentially add that 1% in January or do something if we can as the year starts progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2484)|
| 0:41:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Chris, so just kind of elaborate a little more on this deal with the fee increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| So I guess we'll be prepared if we do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I mean, you kind of covered point A, pass, no pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| If we come up with something in the middle, would you then need to potentially wait until or call a special meeting if you're not ready to do it at the June meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2516)|
| 0:42:06| How do you think we should do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Yeah, I think what would happen is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Depending on what we bring before you and what the body approves, then we may bring back an amendment to the budget in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2532)|
| 0:42:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| So we would just operate potentially at a deficit and you just do an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2549)|

| 0:44:56| And just so the whole Commission is aware, the Mayor has charged me with trying to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| that if revenues are good and then we'll look to see what we can do for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| I know that you all had a conversation and so I just wanted to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| Well, I appreciate that meeting, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| I mean, that's really the thing that we came out of the meeting with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| And I appreciate the Mayor and you and everybody that does that to kind of look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| But we need a long-term plan for our employees, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I think it would make them feel more secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And so I appreciate that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| We'll have roll call vote beginning with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2737)|

| 0:47:03| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2823)|
| 0:47:14| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, adopting the five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| capital improvement plan for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 and procurating funds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2839)|

| 0:47:33| Anders Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Seeing no discussion, motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| This will also be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I guess I'll make more of a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| I think I'll make it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| I'll continue to say that our memorandum of understanding with the school board is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2874)|
| 0:48:03| a good deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| And by us, I don't mean this body because, you know, we get to vote up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| But by us, I mean the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I think we need to remain nimble and flexible enough to be able to respond to true needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| not necessarily contrived one, but true needs of our citizenry, especially of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| We brag and we talk a lot about how things are going, but there's no autopilot with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2907)|
| 0:48:37| And I just really think the deal that the mayor and superintendent are entering in is a bad one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| And I'll just encourage you all to at least continue to monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| Again, this will be my last budget vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| But continue to at least monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| And if it doesn't make sense to you, if something doesn't feel right in your tummy, say something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2935)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2946)|

| 0:49:45| Nine yes, two no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Nine, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Oh, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| We've got a public forum request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Yeah, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We're going to do one more edition of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Before we get there, we need to make a round of announcements or comments if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3006)|
| 0:50:16| The thing that I announced at the work session that I got off on the wrong foot with last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| last Monday, I want to reemphasize that beer board June 27th is at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3024)|
| 0:50:34| Beer board June 27th at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Also this past week, there was an addition to a budget item being introduced to expend funds at the Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3039)|
| 0:50:53| A process which will provide product for Visit Knoxville to market in states adjacent to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3053)|
| 0:51:09| because later that week, there was a program presented by the Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| I have a copy of the presentation of Zoo Knoxville Wildly Fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| They're into a large capital project raising money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| And one of the people there commented that there's buses down there in the parking lot from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| School kids out of state visiting Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| Also earlier this afternoon, the audit committee met with five members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| The next meeting of the audit committee is July the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| It's two months away, basically, at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| Next meeting of the audit committee, July 18th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| I believe that that may cover the things that I've got spread all over the desk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Are there any comments from any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| Any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Anything else on your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Is there any other public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| Anyone wishing to address public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| Sir, name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Mike Sullivan, 5506 Raccoon Valley, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I'm going to throw away my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| They were for 904, which we didn't get the opportunity to take off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| I am a little perturbed, if you will, that things move so quickly that we didn't have a chance to stand up and get recognized to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| So I will limit my comments to the record in saying that I think that was a very, very, very bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| and very important decision that this board just made with regards to the rules regarding the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| You have just severely limited the ability of the ethics committee to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| I think there's a lot of factors that went into that motion being brought before this board that should have been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| I think it coming out of workshop on Monday and being run through tonight on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| without anybody really having the opportunity to look at it is a bit hasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| And I just want to be on the record as saying I am astounded that you can take a citizens' ethics committee put in place by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3221)|
| 0:53:50| and a motion can be put before this board, the preamble of which says these rules are construed to protect the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3230)|
| 0:53:58| and nobody has an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| That board is not there to protect the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| That's not the purpose of that ethics board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| I am upset that we didn't have a chance to discuss that, and I just wanted to be on the record of saying so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Seeing no further discussion at this time, nothing else to come before the board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3254)|

| 0:57:20| that the commission approve the request at CA General Business and F Floodway zoning as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| The commission found that the zoning would be a logical extension of the zoning in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| and would be consistent with the sector plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3458)|

| 0:58:45| Also on the consent agenda that the requested RA Low Density Residential zoning be approved for this 1.8 acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3525)|
| 0:58:53| The commission found that the zoning would be consistent with the sector plan and growth plan designations for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3533)|
| 0:59:01| and is consistent with other low density zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| Seeing no opposition, I move that this be approved for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3546)|

| 1:00:07| again on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| The commission found that the site is flat and has relatively few environmental constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| and that the density of 5 units per acre would be acceptable in the LDR designation of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3615)|
| 1:00:26| Seeing no further discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3626)|

| 1:02:11| The Commission found that the majority of the site is already designated commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| and that the extension of this designation to the property would be compatible with the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3736)|

| 1:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Point of clarity, this is not for zoning. This is for changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| That's correct. This is a sector plan change, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3754)|

| 1:03:58| and that the requested rezoning would be compatible with not only the remainder of this property, but also the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3838)|

| 1:06:03| at a density up to 4.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Property located northeast side of Dry Gap Pike, southeast of Autumn Path Lane in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| I see the applicant standing at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| Seeing no further discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| I make a motion that we hear from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| MPC. Mr. Green, the reason that I'm getting ahead of myself is because this one has been with us for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=3992)|
| 1:06:40| Please, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| The MPC recommendation for this 17.29 acre site was for approval of the request at rezoning to P.R. Plain Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| at a density of up to 4.5 units per acre, as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| The vote was 15-0, again on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| The Commission found that the zoning would be compatible with the surrounding land uses and with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| and would allow uses compatible with the development pattern in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Commissioner McKenzie, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| You know, as you started to allude to, this has kind of been deferred a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| I'm just curious as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| I'd like to ask the representative from B&B Builders why it took so long for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| This got deferred a couple times, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Is this the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| From April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| So was there a reason that we kind of had to carry this so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| I think it was due to we were trying to get everybody with the existing phases to come together and approve everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4065)|
| 1:07:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| Seeing no further discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| I make a motion that we approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| Seeing no further discussion, it is properly before us to approve this rezoning per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4090)|
| 1:08:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Let me back up just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Sir, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4109)|

| 1:08:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Now back to regular agenda order, 3E16SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4130)|
| 1:09:00| 3-E-16-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Request of Dr. Cary Bentley for a Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR Low Density Residential to O Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| Property located south side of Choteau Road, east side of South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| This is in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| I am here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| I recognize the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Mr. Chairman, yes, there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Jason Long, Lowe, Yager, and Brown on behalf of the homeowners association for the middle of Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| There are some others in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| I recognize there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Report of action as stated by MPC, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, this matter was not on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| The vote was 8-4 to recommend the amendment of the Southwest County Sector Plan to office for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| and to forward this recommendation to the County Commission for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| The Commission found that the development of the site under its current designation of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| would be difficult given its proximity to the intersection of Choteau Road and North Shore Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| and that the office use would provide a transition use between the residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| and the commercial uses to the north of this and east of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| The Commission also considered the traffic pattern in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| and felt that the traffic generated by an office given the restrictions on office uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| and the zoning designation would provide for reasonable traffic generation at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4248)|
| 1:10:57| Again, the vote was 8-4 and there was opposition at the Planning Commission meeting at which this was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| Does the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| And as you prepare, Councilor Seymour, let me say for both sides I will attempt to make sure that equal time is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4275)|
| 1:11:24| We will take whatever is necessary to secure a record of the actions taking place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4284)|
| 1:11:37| At last month's County Commission meeting, considerable time was spent on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| and I'm not going to reiterate everything that was said at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| I assume that will be part of the record that you all will consider when you consider your vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| I have with me Mr. Danny Overby, who will be a participant in the development of this office clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| You all may know Mr. Overby. He's sitting right here to my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| He and his family have owned Kimball's Jewelers, one of Knoxville's oldest businesses, for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4332)|
| 1:12:21| Dr. Carrie Bentley, upon advice, is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| She's not used to political controversies and she just thought it would be best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| she and her husband and Mr. Overby, that she not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| She has, however, submitted to commissioners today an email reiterating what she earlier submitted in her affidavit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4357)|
| 1:12:47| which is part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| I will submit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| If anybody did not have an opportunity to review her email to the commissioners today, I will hand it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| Is there anybody that didn't have a chance to review this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| I didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Danny, can you pass these around then and give one to Angie Nesbitt up there who will make it part of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4385)|
| 1:13:14| Let me give you a few more, Danny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| Let me just briefly hit the highlights of what I said last time in the history of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4402)|
| 1:13:33| This is a piece of property at the intersection of Choteau Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4413)|
| 1:13:42| There have been allegations that it's part of the Choteau Mills subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| I have talked to the person who did the legal work for Choteau Mills, who is also a title attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4427)|
| 1:13:55| and she advises me that it was never intended to be part of Choteau Mills and is not part of Choteau Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4435)|
| 1:14:03| The property is presently zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| Now, assuming, as several people who looked at this early on said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| this is a perfect use for this property, a family medical clinic with neighborhoods around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| with no other family medical clinic available in a short distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| Dr. Bentley, who has been in practice for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| decided she wanted to go back into what she had originally done, family medical practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| That is practice dedicated to people living around there, she lives in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| who have aches and pains, need flu shots, need school shots, need camp shots, things of that type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4482)|
| 1:14:53| provide first-tier medical treatment for people who may have been injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| need maybe broke a bone or sprained an ankle or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| She envisioned a family practice such as most of us growing up were accustomed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4504)|
| 1:15:13| She suddenly found herself confronted with rumors and innuendo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| that she intended to operate a pain clinic at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| She felt that would be a violation of the Knox County ordinances to operate a pain clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| or some clinic that just dispenses pain medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| The rumors, however, have persisted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| She has, and this is in part an explanation of why she isn't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| people have come to her house, people have harassed her and other employees at the medical practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| which is located now, people have called and harassed Mr. Overby at his place of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| people have said they will not shop at Kimball's anymore because he's involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| That is their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Nobody is forced to shop at Kimball's, but nonetheless that has kept up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| and is in part the main reason why Dr. Bentley is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| She, I think, is at the end of her rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| Nonetheless, the truth is she is operating and tends to operate here a family medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4585)|
| 1:16:37| She is a medical clinic oriented to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| and there are a number of children and so forth in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| This was recommended by MPC staff and recommended by the planning commission after a full discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4609)|
| 1:16:59| Nonetheless, the arguments continue, the rumors and innuendo, false innuendo, false rumors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4619)|
| 1:17:08| one even stating that she had been arrested for dispensing pain medication, which is absolutely false,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4628)|
| 1:17:17| but it continues to circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| As a result, somewhat hysterically, opposition has developed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4640)|
| 1:17:29| with the thought that she is still going to operate a pain clinic or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| After the last meeting or at the end of the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| it was suggested, I think, that the matter be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| so that we can meet with the neighborhood and see if there was any resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| Dr. Bentley and I met with several representatives of not only Choteau Mills, but the other areas around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| She was, again, reiterated what she did here last month and what I am reiterating here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| She was asked a number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| Would she do this? Would she do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| And I suspect about 90% of them, she said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| The questions were, would you allow traffic to enter from Choteau Mills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| No, it's an impossibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| If you look at the map of the property, you cannot get into the property from Choteau Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| Would you have an entrance on North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| No, there is an entrance off Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| Would you make the architecture consistent with those of the homes in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| The answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Would you pay the HOA dues, even though you contend you're not part of the HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| Certainly, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Will there be adequate parking on the site for your medical clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| so that there will be no overflow parking on Choteau Road and on Choteau Mills Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| Yes, there is adequate parking for a medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| She was asked about hours and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| And all of those, I thought, were satisfactorily answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| But apparently not, because you have a crowd behind me tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| many of whom still think, I believe, that the clinic would be a pain clinic or a pill mill, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4772)|
| 1:19:43| Those are absolutely false allegations that continue to circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| Now, you have a letter from Mr. Long that says this will be out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4788)|
| 1:19:59| Well, I don't see how it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| There is a shopping center across Choteau Road where there is a Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| and despite opposition to that and we will not shop at Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| I think it's a very successful Weigel's store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| And there are spaces in there next to it for office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| The intent, and Mr. Overby can confirm this to you in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| is to build a clinic that will be consistent with the homes on Choteau Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| that will be much more expensive than the homes on Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| People continue to say, well, if Tenova puts a clinic over on the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| which is just to the east across Choteau Road, her clinic will fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| Dr. Bentley does not figure that it will fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| Mr. Overby does not think it will fail, and their bankers are not worried about it failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| Nonetheless, if people are worried about competition in the medical community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| this is the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| A businessman or a businesswoman still has the right to start a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| and still has the right to take bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| So that should not be the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| The issue is, is this good planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| And I refer you to the MPC staff report for the reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4895)|
| 1:21:44| The neighborhood covenants, let me get back to that very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| I have talked to the attorney who did all the legal work back in the early part of this century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| and she says it is not part of the Choteau Mills subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| Our clients are going to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| We hope you approve the zoning tonight, but they're going to buy it regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| because there are a number of other uses that it can be put to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| And we will obtain title insurance that has an endorsement on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| that will cover the uses that can be placed on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| and insure it against the covenants from Choteau Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| I think from the emails you all have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| you would have the impression that everybody out there opposes this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| I can tell you, based on my experience and the people who have called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| several people called me early on and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| what are you doing promoting a pain clinic at Choteau and North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| And I said, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| That was before I had seen the emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I explained to them what Dr. Bentley and Mr. Overby's intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| Those people were satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| And Mr. Overby's had a number of like calls, and Dr. Bentley has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| What happens in a zoning issue like this, when there is hysteria, false information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=4999)|
| 1:23:28| the no's get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| The people who don't care, which is probably the majority of the neighborhoods, are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| People who think it's a good idea are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| And there are people, and Mr. Overby can speak to this in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| who are very much in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| Dr. Bentley, with all the publicity that has been generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| has received calls from people who live in adjoining neighborhoods saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| when you open, I want a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| I am an RN, or I'd like to work as a receptionist, or I am a PA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| I would like to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| So there is support for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| The people you have behind me are the adamant no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| The don't cares are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| And you know how many hundreds of homes there are in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| most of whom are not represented here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| In closing and in summary, I would ask that you look at the MPC staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5077)|
| 1:24:47| I suspect most, if not all, of you all have been to look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| What else can it be used for, if something is to be built on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| other than a medical clinic or a law clinic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| These are things that would be permitted by the office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| A dental office, an insurance office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| This is a perfect use for this property, the OA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| And we ask you to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| And that is the zoning that will go on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| And I suggest to you that OA zoning is far superior to the uses that would be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| in the agricultural zone that is there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| If I may, I'll turn it over to Mr. Overby now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| That timeline being like from 7-17 to 7-31, being in support of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5146)|
| 1:25:57| In the list that I've received in opposition, Counselor Long, if you would speak first, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| then we would be followed by Steve Robinson and then Bill Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| And anyone else, then, that's going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Well, just in the way of a question, so are you going to come back to Mr. Overby after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| after a commensurate amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I think we best go back and forth for a moment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| So he'll come after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| He can come after Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5197)|
| 1:26:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| My name is Jason Long with Lowe, Yeager, and Brown on behalf of the Mill at Choteau Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2102, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| Mr. Seymour and I agree on quite a few things that he said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| When we were last here, Commission Deferred Action on this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| requested that those opposing the application meet with the applicant, Dr. Bentley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| concerning the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| That was a good suggestion, and I think it's led to a healthier debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| At the last meeting, a good portion of the discussion was focused upon credibility issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| of those supporting and opposing the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| As all of you are well aware, zoning decisions can be volatile issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| Unfortunately, passions ran high last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| and I'd say that there was significant breach of decorum in the room considering the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| For that, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| Moreover, there was a perception by some Commission members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| and I'm sure by the applicants as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| that the opponents of the application were being paternalistic in their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| I think Mr. Seymour has referred to the fact that there was anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| that Dr. Bentley's business may fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| In retrospect, I can certainly understand that perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| and to the extent my remarks or those of my clients led to that perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| I can assure you that was not the intent, and we wholeheartedly apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| I will say that I represent the mill at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| I think in the correspondence that I sent you this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| I did identify that while I was retained and represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| or hired by the board of directors of that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| we do know one member, one resident of the mill at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| who has voiced disagreement with this opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| but that's the only one there that we are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| My clients did send representatives to meet with Dr. McFarland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| and were joined by representatives of other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| I don't know if the doctor met with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| and I can say that we worked hard to limit the number of people in the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| so that we could encourage a fair and open discussion of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| and that's what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| Both parties had an opportunity to discuss the plans and concerns in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| and then had an opportunity to discuss what, if any, agreement could be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| Dr. Bentley was very receptive to considering accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| to her proposed office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| and my clients earnestly proposed potential accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| that may alleviate their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| Ultimately, they determined that their fundamental objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| with this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| is that it proposes to put non-residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| within their residential community, the mill at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| So that brings us to tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| and we don't want tonight to be a credibility debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| and we certainly do not want it to be further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| about whether or not this is a proposed pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| As I indicated at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| the residents of the mill at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| and hopefully everyone in this room by this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| knows that there will be no pain clinic going in at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| My clients accept everything at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| for the purposes of tonight's debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| that Dr. McFarland has represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| They do not disagree that she intends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| to open a family medical practice facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| and that she is in earnest in those desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| The problem is that even assuming those facts to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| the practice simply does not belong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| on Lot 19 of the Choteau Mill subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| and there are simply no accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| and my clients have wrestled with this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| but there are no accommodations that will make it fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| It is out of character with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| and let me explain briefly why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| This is, and I would be happy to pass it around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| because I recognize that it can be a little bit difficult to see from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| but this is the plat of the mill at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| the actual residential subdivision in which my clients live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| There are 19 numbered parcels on this plat map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| We are talking about parcel number 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| which is identified by this map as part of the mill at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| When my clients purchased homes in the mill at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| this was the plat map upon which they based their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| This was the understanding of the boundaries of their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| I will concede that Lot 19 sticks out like a sore thumb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| at the end of this neighborhood, but it is within this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| and it is within this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Mr. Seymour has indicated to you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| that he spoke with the developer who never intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| and does not believe that Lot 19 fits within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| That developer should talk to Chancellor Weaver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| who made a contrary decision in the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| as to whether or not Lot 19 was required to pay homeowners association dues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| and he found that the covenants and restrictions to that lot did apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| When we discuss zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| a primary concern is always the rights of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| We don't want to restrict people on the fair use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| However, I'd suggest that equally important to the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| who is attempting to sell Lot 19 in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| are the rights of the people who currently live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| and made the decision to live there based upon a certain character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| and nature of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| understanding that within their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| they could expect a residential community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| and could expect not to have significantly detrimental changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| I'd like everyone who is here tonight in opposition to this application to please stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| and if you could remain standing for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| The people you see standing behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| are from neighborhoods all over southwest Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| neighborhoods including the Millett Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| Choteau Fields, Greystone Court, Bayou Bend, Cabot Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| Falcon Point, Hidden Cove, and Montgomery Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| I have no doubt that I have left some neighborhoods out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| but those are the ones that I'm absolutely aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| They're here, many of them a second time, to make their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| They moved into the area for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Southwest Knoxville is rural and residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| In fact, it's one of the few significantly large areas in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| where there hasn't been substantial commercial, retail, or office encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| That's why they chose to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| The expectations of the community were that it would stay residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| Thank you all. You may sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5633)|
| 1:34:01| Mr. Seymour indicated that the only people standing behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| were the fervent no's to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| and that the vast majority of people don't care, won't show up, won't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| I would like to point out that this is the second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| that this matter has come before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| It is historically difficult to get people to continually attend commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| to let their voices be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| We're in the middle of spring break, or not spring break, we're in the middle of summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| where many people are on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| and to have the turnout that we have, I'm quite impressed by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| But even if that doesn't impress you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| the over 460 signatures that we submitted by petition at last commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| should impress upon you the desire of this community not to allow this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| Their expectation is reasonable for two primary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| First, MPC and the sector plan have given these people indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| that the area would remain residential west of the markets at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| In 2005, the southwest sector plan anticipated that the area would remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| There have been amendments to the sector plan before, specifically in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| there was an application for the development of the markets at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| and subsequently at Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| And MPC recommended those applications, but in the debate on the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| the then executive director noted that those opposing the developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| to those opposing the developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| that the intention was to limit commercial to the sites being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| and to resist development of commercial down north shore drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Now MPC suggests that there's a need for transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| but the residents were already under the impression that the area down north shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| was secure as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| The natural fear is that further development, even as office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| will continue a domino effect down north shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| and take away the residential and rural character of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| As I've stated earlier, the expectation was also reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| because the piece of property we are discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| is already within a planned residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| I will grant, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| developing this property as office is effectively flipping the script| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| on the people who currently live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| and have invested themselves and their families in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| for the primary reason that it is rural in character and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| I'd like to ask Mark Nimzer to come up and assist me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| in passing out an email that was sent to Commissioner Broyles, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| but I'm not sure that the rest of the commission got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| If you could pass one up to the floor and then circulate it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| This is an email from a woman who has given us permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| to relate it to commission tonight, Lolita Cresson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| She spoke at the last commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| but again she unfortunately was out of town for tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| I'm going to try to summarize it briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| because I understand that it's fairly lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| She's a lifelong resident of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| having traveled all over our county for work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| and has lived in Cabot Ridge for the past 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| And as she indicates in her email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| she chose to live there because of the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| I'd like to highlight her concerns about this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| because, quite frankly, I think she says it better than any lawyer would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| She's concerned that MPC did not perform due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| as to the needs and wants of the residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| For that, she points to the 2005 Southwest Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| calling for commercial development only along a small area off Concord Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| with no denotation of land use for neighborhood commercial or office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| west of Concord Road to the Loudoun County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| She expresses in this email, and she did at the meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| concern about the traffic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| And she points to an interesting fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| MPC is not required to perform a traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| because it's anticipated that the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| will produce more than 750 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| But we take these parcels one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| So when the Weigels is developed, we evaluate whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| there would be 750 trips or more per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| as to whether an impact study should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| And then we put that to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| And then when Lot 19 is developed, we'll go through the same analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| And inevitably, when the parcel of property right next to Lot 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| is subsequently developed for office or commercial or retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| we'll do an analysis as to whether it increases above 750 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| But cumulatively, while no single parcel requires an impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| the impact of traffic in the area can be intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| And it can be significant for an area as rural as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| Contrary to the reports of MPC, according to Ms. Cresson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| South North Shore cannot be deemed a minor arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| The 2005 sector report references the last traffic study that she knew of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| a 1994 through 2004 traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| that indicated at least six of the streets listed in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| were those with the highest increase in traffic for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| There's been exponential residential growth in the area since the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| Nine subdivisions off North Shore Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| Three off South Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Two off South North Shore heading west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| Six off Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Three within a quarter mile located within Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| It's an indication that people want to move there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| and they want to move there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| They want to move there because it's residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| because it's away from business, it's away from office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| it's away from commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| In fact, Ms. Cresson indicated in her email that she spoke with MPC officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| at the May 9th meeting on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| And they discussed Phase 5 and 6 of Falcon Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| which could add as much as 2,500 additional daily trips in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| Ms. Cresson is concerned that there is no need for transitional space here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| and points out that there are two other parcels on this roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| that are residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| She advocates waiting for the results of MPC's review of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| which is now underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| And she applauds Mr. Archer for his efforts to build consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| as to what is best for southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| In short, the reasonable expectations of the people who stood up behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| and of Ms. Cresson are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| We deserve the security that long-term planning affords homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| If development is appropriate down North Shore Drive, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| I think many people in this room would disagree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| but ultimately that is a consensus that could be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| through the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| But let's not do this development piecemeal, one lot at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| If you're going to do it, take time to study the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| have meaningful input from the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| and come to a consensus about the future of southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you, Councilor Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Councilor Seymour, back to your presentation was with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6106)|
| 1:41:56| Is he wishing to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Is that what you were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Mr. Overby, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| Danny Overby, PO Box 51744, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Again, I'll make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| The concerns that some people have mentioned, I think, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| at least we're all acting civilized this time, which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| I grew up in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| I grew up on the honor system, not only in my home but in my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| And I bring that to the podium tonight because I want to talk about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| that there were at least six residents of Choteau Mills who personally told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| they were in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| They thought it was great that it would, in fact, reduce traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| because you could get health care in your own community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| some of whom said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| it would be great to be able to walk to a doctor's office if I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| As you know, I am the real estate business side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Only the physician can own the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| But as a partner, one of the things that I do is I ensure that any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| and everything that I do is done above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| I think even though John changed his position, he can tell you without a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| without a doubt, I've never once done anything other than what I said I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| Is that a fair statement, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| Everything we've ever talked about was the truth, and it was fair to all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| I have never once changed my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| Never once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| And the character and the nature of the neighborhood was one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| that we first talked about when we first met with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| Our first meeting was on February 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| long before Tenova was even a prospect or a client in a leased facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| In order to be successful in business today, you have to be an owner-occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| That's how you get financing with the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| It's how you secure yourself and you secure your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| and you're paying rent to eventually be able to have some equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| which would be the good doctor's retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| We also plan on investing almost twice the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| that the average home in the area costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| so I think that would be an enhancement to property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6262)|
| 1:44:29| 1615 Choteau Road is not part of that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| but we've reached out to the residents to try to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| For example, maintain their sign, put a small green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| You know, the home in Choteau Mills that's closest to this proposed site is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| All the copper's been ripped out, and nefarious activities have gone on in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Nobody's even bothered to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| I brought it up tonight because I hope that the bank in New York that owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| will sell it to someone, and they'll rehab this house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| and they'll make it into something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| But I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| It's a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| So we're all part of the same community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| We're all subject to the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| You know, a lot of the signatures on that petition were anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| Some were even from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| The traffic impact is something that we studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| We did a full demographic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| and one of the things that I've done in business before, and I learned it from my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| My dad has only had two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| His job for the Exxon Corporation was picking site locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| He's a pretty thoroughly educated guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| His MBA from the University of Virginia taught him a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| but his experience taught him more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| He worked with me on site locations for our current business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| and he also helped me even though he works three days a week and he's 83 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| He still wrote out with me, and he took a look, and he advised me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| I wouldn't do anything that's bad for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| I work for all these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| I'm a servant in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| Everyone knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| What I am proposing is something good for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| It's the best use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| We are going to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| I talked to the closing agent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| There is no doubt we are purchasing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| We will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Zoned agriculturally, I think, would be a lesser use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| because we'll certainly have to do something to produce income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| Any investment does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| I would yield any time that I may have remaining to any questions that you may have of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| I asked this before, and I'll ask it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| I stand here before you prepared to ask any and all questions, anything anyone's got for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Who actually owns the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Who owns it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Now or when we purchase it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Who owns it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Victor, and I'm sorry, I don't know his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| Brian Levinson was representing it for NIF for REMAX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Does he live in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Yes, I assume that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| I'm buying it through REMAX, Brian Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| So it's listed for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| What we did is we've signed a contract, and we close this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| Victor Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Phillips is his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I couldn't mention this for security reasons in the jewelry business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| but I've been out of the country for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| Well, I just wondered because the last meeting, you know, normally in meetings like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| you have an owner who shows up and talks about things, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| and there was no owner last time, and he's not here tonight either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| No, I understand there was a pretty tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| We had a meeting with some of the former residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| and that's part of the problem is that they've had a difficult time from others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| and we're suffering a little bit from the bad taste left in their mouth from this owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| and we have none of those type intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| We're trying to do something good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| I thank you all for your generosity, your time, and your thoughtfulness in this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| difficult matter for you to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Mr. Steve Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6498)|
| 1:48:28| Steve Robinson, 12523 Choteau Mill Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Thank you all very much for having us back again this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| This will be the third time that I've, on this matter, been in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| whether before you or before the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| There's a few things that I want to address, and I'm going to kind of bounce all over the places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| so if you all will give me a little bit of latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| The first thing I want to address is Mr. Seymour's characterization of all these men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| women, and children that are here tonight as just nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| We're just here to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| These are people that care tremendously about the community that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| They're passionate about where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| They're passionate about their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| They're passionate about their friends and their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| and everything that they've invested in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| and they invested it knowing what was out there before there was any commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| They invested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| They invested in that community based on the nothingness that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| That's why I came out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I love the pasture that I have behind me, and I know those days are numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| I'm going to have a house behind me and not horses, but right now I love the horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6576)|
| 1:49:43| Any commercial development in that area, in my opinion, is out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| That goes for the markets at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| That goes for Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| However, that was approved and that was placed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| I still feel it's out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| Continuing any commercial development, whether you call it just a buffer, a transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| whatever you phrase it, it's something that's generating revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| It's bringing people in from outside of the community, most certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| that are going to be traveling to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| It's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| It's another business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| It's more of the creep of business into our residential life that we didn't move out there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| Now, I've had an occasion to sit and talk with Mr. Overby and Dr. McFarland numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| and the conversations we've had have been interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| A lot of it has centered on the former topic, and it was never a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| There was never concern about a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| We understand that there's regulations around a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| We've never had that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| As much as that keeps getting brought up, that's not any one of us that's ever said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| and we're on the record as being adamantly opposed to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| and on the record as saying we don't believe she's operating a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| One of the things that's interesting that came out of our meeting with Dr. McFarland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| when we sat down at the advice of the commission a couple weeks ago and we got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| and we were talking about different ideas and different possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| In the conversation with Dr. McFarland, we were talking about the actual use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| how they would situate a building on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| talking about a 3,500-square-foot building that would probably require, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| some three parking lots or three parking spots per however many square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| You've got a 3,000-square-foot building with the parking, with sanitation, with medical sanitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6703)|
| 1:51:52| and then you're on a 0.9-acre lot with setbacks on all four sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| I believe it's 40 feet from North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| I believe it's 30 feet from Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| I believe it's another 30 feet from the rest of the neighborhood that it's a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| and then another 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| So you start encroaching in that 0.9 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| and you try to see how we're going to situate a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| Even Dr. McFarland acknowledged she didn't know if it was viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| and that was shocking to me, that as they've done all the studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| and they've looked at this every different way for her to say that they don't know it's viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| That's our contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| We don't think it's viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| That lot would be an ideal green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| I understand Mr. Overby is saying he's going to buy the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| We've been through this over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| I've been in the neighborhood since the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| and we've had run-ins with that lot nonstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| Before the markets at Choteau, somebody wanted to put commercial on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| I was here before you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| I spoke with you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| That was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Commercial was placed down Choteau with a shell station at Rocky Top Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| We've been battling this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| It's gone from developer to developer to developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| hoping that they were going to rezone it for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| And it's always come to the same conclusion, that it's not proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| It's not part of the fabric of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| That's why it's never been rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| That's why it's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| That's why a barn sits right adjacent to the lot, because it's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| I implore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| We received almost 500 signatures from the residents that are in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6814)|
| 1:53:42| that are asking you, that are begging you to please reject this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| We just want to keep this as a part of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| and good fitting with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| and something that is appropriate for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| and we don't feel like this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| Lot 19 is a numbered lot in the mill at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| The official plat states it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Chancellor Weaver concurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| They've acknowledged that they'll need to pay HOA dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| They've acknowledged that they'll pay HOA dues twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| yet they contend that it's not part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| HOA dues, homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| Lot 19 is a part of the mill at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| We ask that you don't allow commercial to creep any further down North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| I respectfully ask for your no vote on this this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you, Mr. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Mr. Bill Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| Mr. Bill Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| My name is Bill Powers, and I live in Choteau Fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| which is just across from this proposed lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| I understand that it's been probably a challenge for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and even for us out in the community to deal with some of the things around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6910)|
| 1:55:17| We were not communicated to very early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| We haven't spent a lot of time just getting educated, learning what the facts were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| and I know that you guys have had some probably challenging e-mails that I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6926)|
| 1:55:33| I think if you look beyond those e-mails that came out and you look at the passion of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| the people are asking that this not be converted right now, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| that you guys take a look at it, take a look at our view from the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| and not make the change today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| I think if you look at the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| there is more commercial space over there available that is not used, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| and we're talking about utilizing some more, you know, converting this commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| So our neighborhood is right across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| We have about 47 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| In about three days, we got all but five signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| We're due to people that were traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| Our neighborhood, which has very good representation here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| probably the larger representation based on the size of our neighborhood, is really opposed against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| The good doctor and the team here, I'm sure that they have well intentions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| but our intentions is right now is not the time to convert this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| So we know it's been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| We appreciate your patience and time with this, and we just ask you to vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Thank you, Mr. Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Counselor Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| In response to concerns raised by Mr. Long and the subsequent speaker, Mr. Robinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7016)|
| 1:57:06| Mr. Overby points out to me that he has a 12,000-square-foot building on one acre of land on Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7026)|
| 1:57:16| Dr. Bentley's clinic would be 3,000 to 3,500 square feet on nine-tenths of an acre, roughly equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7036)|
| 1:57:28| In response to the issues about, well, this is part of Choteau Mills, it's subject to our covenants, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7048)|
| 1:57:38| I would direct your attention to the MPC staff report, which is in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| The MPC staff report advises you, and their maps show that Lot 19, the one we're talking about, is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7065)|
| 1:57:56| It is not zoned residential. It's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| The Lots 1 through 18 of Choteau Mills are zoned separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| They are zoned planned residential and, by the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| limited to single-family homes at a density of up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7090)|
| 1:58:19| So this is further evidence that this is not part of Choteau Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| If it had been, it would have been rezoned to planned residential at one to three units per acre at the time the Lots 1 through 18 were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7105)|
| 1:58:36| So the question is, do you want to leave the property agricultural and use it under that ordinance or those uses that are permitted there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7116)|
| 1:58:50| or would OA, as MPC staff and MPC have noted, is a good use for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7130)|
| 1:59:03| So the threat of litigation over the covenants is not a threat that worries the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7143)|
| 1:59:15| We can insure against that, and we will be happy to submit our case to Chancery Court if such a lawsuit is filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7155)|
| 1:59:26| I would also direct your attention to the MPC staff report, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7166)|
| 1:59:38| which says office uses at this site are appropriate on this one-acre property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| located at the traffic circle intersection of Choteau Road and South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| It would be compatible with surrounding land use and zoning patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| Adjacent to the traffic circle on the corner, the site is not desirable for the currently proposed LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7194)|
| 2:00:03| and office uses would present a logical transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7203)|
| 2:00:11| The argument that if this is permitted, then there will be office and commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7211)|
| 2:00:18| and by the way, office is not a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| Office is very strictly prescribed in your zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| that there will be office uses up and down North Shore through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| Most of the area is presently under development for, or will be under development, for single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7231)|
| 2:00:42| The property to the east, or excuse me, to the west of this, I think at some time in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7242)|
| 2:00:49| will be used for single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| So the issue tonight is, is agricultural the best use for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| Not residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Residential is one of the uses permitted in the agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| or as MPC staff and the Metropolitan Planning Commission note and set forth in their report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7266)|
| 2:01:16| is office an appropriate use for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| That's the issue we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| If you deny this, it remains agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| If you grant or approve the rezoning, it is a limited office uses are permitted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7286)|
| 2:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| Councillor Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7296)|
| 2:01:47| Agriculture may be the best use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| I don't know, I can't say that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| I know that a lot of residents live there with the expectation of, as I've said, rural community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| and a fervent desire to maintain that character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| But if agriculture isn't the best use for this property, that's fine too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| so long as the decisions that are made about this property are done in a deliberate and organized and studied manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7329)|
| 2:02:20| If we're going to look at this property, if we're worried about its productivity or its use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| let's make sure that it's looked at in the next sector plan discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| Let's make sure that the appropriate studies are in place to evaluate the traffic patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| that are incrementally developing in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| Let's make sure that community input is taken into account in a meaningful and educated fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| before we piecemeal rezone this piece of property, which we can stand up here and debate all day long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7363)|
| 2:02:50| and we may end up debating in a courtroom as to whether or not it's actually a part of the mill at Chota Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7370)|
| 2:02:58| But all I have seen is a plat map that says it is, and all I've seen are covenants and restrictions that say that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7378)|
| 2:03:06| and all I've seen is an opinion by Chancellor Weaver which seems to indicate that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7386)|
| 2:03:12| And so I think the fact that these residents relied upon a well-defined boundary for their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7392)|
| 2:03:20| and the desire to live within that community surrounded by residences is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| and I think they've expressed that tonight and I hope you'll consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| and at least at this point vote not to approve the application. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| And fellow commissioners, do you have questions of any of the petitioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| I have a question of Mr. Green when it comes appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| Or of the MPC. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| Mr. Green, I guess I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| One, where are you all working? What part of the sector plan are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| Have you just started the review? Are you in the middle of the review? Where are we at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| We're in about the middle of the review of the southwest sector plan now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| and hope to have it completed by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| Okay, so we don't have a, do we know what the potential, is there a recommendation on that area yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7452)|
| 2:04:19| Not yet. We're still receiving public input on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| Okay. And going back to, I struggle with this rezoning a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7462)|
| 2:04:30| going back to the agricultural zoning and then I guess we're in 5.22 of our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7470)|
| 2:04:44| Am I reading this correctly that everything from 5.22.01 to 0.02 is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7484)|
| 2:04:53| until it comes down to use on review permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| That's correct. Those uses are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| And they range from houses and duplexes to mobile homes to portable sawmills to demolition landfills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| are permitted without any further public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| It would be staff review of the site plan, but that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| And then there are a number of uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| which means that those uses would be subject to review by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7516)|
| 2:05:24| That's the struggle I have is the best use struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| I certainly don't think a duplex or a yard sale, slaughterhouse for animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7529)|
| 2:05:42| that's in roadside stands, mobile home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| I think you can store a home that's been moved, I think you can store one there for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| Those are kind of the things that I struggle with is that you could park three, four houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| that are on stilts right here off a trailer and put a for sale sign on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| and leave them on the corner as long as they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| And so that's the struggle I find here is the best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7563)|
| 2:06:10| And so I don't want it to turn into that, but it could turn into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| You can put three mobile homes on there, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| and then battle it out with your covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| But I struggle with thinking that ag is the best use for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| but I also understand the residents' concern with the office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| So I kind of look forward to more debate because I'm still in the middle on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| I'll continue with the sentence that I used a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| Let me say we're at the stage of my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| Are there other questions of the presenters, whether they be the applicant, the opposition, or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| Well, I had a question for Mr. Green here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| I've been on the MPC at one stint for eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| and I've never seen a subdivision that had PR in one section of it and ag in another section of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7628)|
| 2:07:16| but it's listed on that plot plan as 19 as being part of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7636)|
| 2:07:24| Have you ever seen that before where you had two zonings in one subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Not this one, but have you seen another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| Continuing with questions of the applicant, opposition, or MPC, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7660)|
| 2:07:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| That was one of the other questions I wanted to confirm with Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| because there are two zoning designations on tracts of land that it would not necessarily just be planned residential for all the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7672)|
| 2:08:03| The other thing I wanted to mention was that the public, when they use the term commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7683)|
| 2:08:10| they are referencing any non-residential use, and I'll repeat that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7690)|
| 2:08:17| They're using that as a non-residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| So when the public is saying commercial, they're incorporating the term office as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| and I found that in my conversations with the folks in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| The other question for Mr. Green is you do have a tally so far from the Southwest Sector Plan meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| as far as the input that you've received regarding zoning designations on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7719)|
| 2:08:47| I believe that, well, I'll let you answer the question because I think you have a pretty firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| Based on the public comments we received so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| there's a strong will for no further commercial development and commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| or commercial designations on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| And that's basically because several years ago, the community, when the markets at Choteau was put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7747)|
| 2:09:17| the community agreed that that was the only place for non-residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| were to be located on the markets at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| And I think if you go out and look at the markets at Choteau, that property is not 50% filled yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7767)|
| 2:09:35| So there's no hardship to say that that development is sold out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| and now we've got to jump across the street and grab another track of land to do a non-residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7780)|
| 2:09:48| So I think that the community was under the understanding that any non-residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| would be confined to the John Huber or the markets at Choteau property, however you want to classify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7794)|
| 2:10:03| Continuing, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| I share Brad's interest and concern in what would provide the most protection for the residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7810)|
| 2:10:18| I look at where the zoning is now, and the lots within the subdivision are all zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7818)|
| 2:10:25| However, this is not. It's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| And when I look at the uses that are permitted on an agricultural lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| I do become concerned for the neighborhood at what could be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| And when I look at what is allowed under the Office of Medical and Related Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| and the technology overlay, it seems, and I'm guessing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| and also I trust the judgment and the knowledge and the expertise of our MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| that that is what provides the most protection to that neighborhood because it is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7856)|
| 2:11:07| those uses are much more tightly controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| Agricultural, you could raise pigs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| I mean, you could put, as Brad said, mobile homes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| which I wouldn't think would be in keeping with the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7883)|
| 2:11:31| So I really, I am concerned about what's the best use for that particular piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7891)|
| 2:11:42| and what's going to provide the best protection to the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| We have questions of the presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| I just wanted to ask Mr. Green if he had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| could you kind of talk through what MPC staff looked at when they made this recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| We looked primarily at the land use pattern in the area, the access to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7921)|
| 2:12:09| the apparent desirability for residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| the impact of the permitted uses in the agricultural zone on the surrounding land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7934)|
| 2:12:22| compared those to the impacts, the potential impacts of the uses permitted in the office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| and made a determination based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| Again, the impacts of the uses permitted now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| the impacts of the uses that would be permitted under the office zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7954)|
| 2:12:39| the desirability of that site, apparent desirability for residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| the traffic patterns in the area, the potential traffic impact that would be generated by office uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| and tried to assess all those and weigh those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| We look at it a bit more objectively because we don't have the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| or the challenge of public input when we make our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| We typically don't have a lot of public input until the first MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| and that's when we get the input that's similar to what we've had tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=7990)|
| 2:13:21| Commissioner Brown, any questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| Mr. Green, which carries the most weight, subdivision covenants or zoning regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8010)|
| 2:13:43| That's a tough one, and I'll give an answer and then may look to Mr. Sanders also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| The subdivision covenants are as strong as the homeowners association that is willing to enforce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| The zoning designation has the weight of the government enforces those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| In my opinion, the zoning regulations would have stronger or a higher level of importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8041)|
| 2:14:11| The local governments do not enforce subdivision or homeowners covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| That's entirely up to that homeowners association and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| and again, it depends on the strength of that homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| and their willingness to enforce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| The zoning ordinance does carry the authority of the local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| and their ability to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| But yet, when a piece of property is zoned for subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| and the developer goes in and puts in a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| the homeowners association decides, okay, we need some covenants for this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| They supersede anything else that goes on in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| Not in my jurisdiction as the administrator of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| That's, again, totally up to the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| Bottom line, if they go to court, though, if the homeowners association goes to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| anyone who signs up in there and is agreed to abide by the subdivision covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8105)|
| 2:15:14| the court's going to rule in their favor if that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| Now, this particular piece of property, I've heard different stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| and supposedly this lot 19 is part of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8123)|
| 2:15:32| So if it's part of that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| and it's paying subdivision homeowners dues at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| from what I understand, paid the back dues and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| then it should be under the same rules and regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| No matter if it's zoned agricultural or if it's zoned low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| And I also heard that the big sign for this subdivision happens to reside on lot 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8156)|
| 2:16:08| Not in the rest of the subdivision, but it's on this particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| So how do you control one thing one way and one another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8174)|
| 2:16:22| It just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| It's got to be either in or it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| So where do we go, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| I think the answer is quite a bit more simple than for our purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8195)|
| 2:16:43| The most important thing is the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| For the purpose of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| the subdivision regulations do not control what your decision will ultimately be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8209)|
| 2:16:56| And the extent to which you should consider those subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| is secondary or it's on down the line from the things you should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8223)|
| 2:17:12| Your decision should be based on the terms of the zoning regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| not your interpretation of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| But if this particular piece of property is part of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| it is governed by the governance of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| It may very well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| So there could be no pigs or mobile homes or anything else put in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8254)|
| 2:17:42| Well, yes, but what's before this body today is a rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| and a request for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| What could currently go in on that lot under the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| is not a consideration that should drive your decision on the sector plan or the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8279)|
| 2:18:10| Well, it would make this a whole lot simpler if this lot was zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| the same as the rest of its brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| But in this case, it's like what comes first, the chicken or the egg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8298)|
| 2:18:26| It's part of the subdivisions, so it needs to come under subdivision rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8306)|
| 2:18:35| Again, the subdivision regulations are a private agreement between property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8315)|
| 2:18:42| Mr. Seymour is correct in that the county does not enforce the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| But the courts do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| The courts do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| The county in this body enforces and enacts and amends from time to time the zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8330)|
| 2:18:59| and that is what's in front of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| They're two separate bodies of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| I realize that, but still, the actions that we take here tonight dictate what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8349)|
| 2:19:19| It has a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| If we vote one way, then this is going to happen or that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| So, I mean, it's still confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8366)|
| 2:19:32| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| Commissioner Bussler, questions of the applicant, opposition, or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8374)|
| 2:19:43| Mr. Green, I've got one other thing about this zoning right here that's kind of troubling right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8383)|
| 2:19:50| is that we've got planned residential in 18 lots, and we've got one lot that's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8390)|
| 2:19:59| Now, in your zoning theory of what you do, if you have planned residential of one to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8399)|
| 2:20:06| which this one is, then when you go from that zoning and you go to another more intense zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8406)|
| 2:20:16| what would be the logical step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| Would it be going to office or commercial, or would it be to a more intense number of units on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8418)|
| 2:20:27| What is the thought behind when you're doing your zoning, when you have that low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| what's your next zoning that you'd go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| And let me make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| We're talking about what is the best protection for the individuals that live in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| They bought in the subdivision, and behind them is a large agricultural piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| which could be used for anything, and we're not here to say protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| What is the zoning that we need to put on this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| That's my thought behind it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| Mr. Green, would you tell me your logical progression of zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| I'll tell you that with respect to this property because, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| the size of the property helps determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| Being a .9-acre parcel, we felt that a higher-density residential would not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| especially at the intersection of two roads, would not be a reasonable transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| would not be a workable transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| The office zoning would allow development on a .9-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| would not be impacted by the location at the intersection of two roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| would make a reasonable transition from the commercial to the northeast to the residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8495)|
| 2:21:41| and could, given the uses permitted in the office park zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| provide for uses which would not adversely impact the residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| but could serve those residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Those were the thought patterns that the staff went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| in reviewing this request and making that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Commissioner Brantley, questions of the applicant, opposition, or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| Actually, Mr. Chairman, I guess this is an open-ended question for anyone who can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| I'd like to know if the current owner pays HOA fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| There was litigation over the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| There was a resolution I think that settled the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| but the current homeowner or the current property owner does pay HOA dues to the association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| under the terms of that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| I don't know if those earlier questions were directed specifically to Chairman Green or to people who have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8557)|
| 2:22:46| but to the extent this property is zoned agricultural currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| and there are agricultural uses that it can be put to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| again, the property owners there certainly recognize that they may have to enforce their rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8574)|
| 2:22:59| if they have any other covenants and restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| and they realize that that may be their protection against potential uses of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| They also recognize that that area is littered with agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| and issues of pig farming and three or four mobile homes have not been presented to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| Now, they certainly could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| but I believe I speak for at least the residents within our neighborhood community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| that they feel like they're empowered to defend their rights under their agreements should it come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8605)|
| 2:23:31| So when looking at the uses of potential agriculture, there are mechanisms to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Just going to the covenants themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| where they say lots 1 through 18 shall be restricted exclusively to single-family residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8629)|
| 2:23:59| It does not mention lot 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| Well, if the court says it's part of it and then forced them to pay them, that makes it part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| That was part of a settlement, an agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| The parties negotiated a settlement in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| It's still a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| I beg to disagree, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| If it's not part of it, why are they paying dues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| Because they agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| Questions of the applicant, opposition or MPC, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| Yeah, this would be for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| I'm looking at the regulations for OA, office park zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| because there was some discussion of what could go on an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| It says that you could put radio, TV and recording studios, art galleries and museums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| but you could also put demolition landfills on that property in an OA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| So to say that an agricultural zone is not as good as an OA zone, I don't quite follow that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| But is that a true statement, what I'm reading from the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Commissioner Anders, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| Yeah, I've got one, Mr. Arthur, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| You said that the covenants mention lots 1 through 18 for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| What does it say anywhere in the covenants in reference to 19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| Nothing, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| I will read the sentence that follows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| Lots 1 through 18 shall be restricted exclusively to single-family residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| No lot or any portion thereof shall at any time be used for any commercial business or professional purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8744)|
| 2:25:51| provided, however, that nothing shall be, which doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| Basically, they could use it for a staging area for their homes or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| The drafter of these subdivision restrictions is an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8762)|
| 2:26:08| They were drafted in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| When I asked her, she's also a title attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| I said, could we buy an amendment or a rider to a title policy that would guarantee us legal defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8777)|
| 2:26:32| if a suit was brought claiming that this was subject to these restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| And the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| She'd already checked with her underwriter on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| Mr. Long, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| I'm sorry, I was digging out my copy of the covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| Mr. Seymour accurately quoted the two sentences that have been referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| There's a sentence that says lots 1 through 18 shall be exclusively residential, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| and then says no lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| It doesn't specify lots 1 through 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| It says no lot shall be used for essentially commercial or any business purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| And I would refer to the definitions section of the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8833)|
| 2:27:20| at the very beginning of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| It defines lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| It defines lots, lots shown upon any recorded subdivision, plat, or map of the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| shall mean and refer to all numbered residential lots shown on any recorded subdivision, plat, or map of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| That is the capital lot, L with a capital L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| What Chancellor Reaver found when he issued his opinion in the lawsuit over payment of HOA dues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| is that lots with a lower case L meant all lots within the actual subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| and that included lot 19, which is why they got to the point where they had to reach a settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| So we would argue that the decision has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| This lot is included within this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| Certainly there are some accepted out for exclusively residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| but, again, no lot shall be used for commercial purposes or business purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8889)|
| 2:28:16| If you would bear with me for just a moment, I believe that Commissioner Paul Pinkston has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8896)|
| 2:28:27| He would have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| And I believe that Commissioner Pinkston's question is can we take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8908)|
| 2:28:34| Would that be agreeable with you, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| We will come back at 845.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8918)|
| 2:28:45| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8925)|
| 2:28:50| I believe as we went on break, Commissioner McKenzie, did you have a question of the applicant, presenters, or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8930)|
| 2:29:00| I actually have one for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| That's an acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| I'll put that down in my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| If we can add him to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| We'll add him to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| And it's just, you know, we've kind of heard a lot said along, you know, homeowners and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8950)|
| 2:29:18| So I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| Our capacity to decide and make judgments and vote is solely dealing with the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8962)|
| 2:29:36| Not the anything associated with Chancellor Weaver's decision or anything as it relates to the HOA and fees and dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8976)|
| 2:29:46| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| So that answers a lot for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8990)|
| 2:29:56| My question to MPC, that being said, I'm going to jump back in the pool here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=8996)|
| 2:30:04| You had said earlier, I think Commissioner Bussler or no, Commissioner Brantley asked you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| have you seen a kind of a double zoned development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9009)|
| 2:30:16| And you said that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| So have you seen a development that has non-residential, I don't want to, you know, commercial office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9019)|
| 2:30:29| but non-residential zoning as a part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| And in those, and you may not be able to answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9036)|
| 2:30:43| are you versed enough to know whether those entities, those business-like entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9043)|
| 2:30:50| paid non-residential entities paid into that particular communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| And I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| I don't know that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Not every HOA would have dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| I mean, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| That wasn't my question, but thank you for the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9066)|
| 2:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| Continuing with questions of applicant, opposition, or MPC, or the law director, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9074)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| This question is for Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| Since we have two different decisions from two different attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| when you see this platted subdivision that's dated, looks like September 5th, 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9098)|
| 2:31:45| do you agree that Lot 19 is part of this subdivision at the mill at Choteau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| It's shown on that plat as approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9115)|
| 2:31:56| That was the only question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| I'm going to smile when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| It doesn't matter did he do it or is he guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| We've been at this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| Are there other questions of the applicants, opposition, or MPC from my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9135)|
| 2:32:26| Seeing no further discussion at this stage of the meeting, we need to move into a little bit different frame of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9146)|
| 2:32:34| I was questioned on this earlier this afternoon, and it relates to my individual, as a commissioner, discussions with people for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9154)|
| 2:32:54| Those that have called me on the phone, I answer the phone, and I might speak about their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9174)|
| 2:33:02| but it's improper for me to say what may be my opinion of what's taking place tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9182)|
| 2:33:12| We are here tonight as a quasi-judicial body, and the decision the commission is about to make in the next little while is based on what we have received here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9192)|
| 2:33:28| not what may have been said to us in the week or two or three gone by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9208)|
| 2:33:38| and it must not be a decision based on the speculation of what we might think will happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9218)|
| 2:33:47| This is a quasi-judicial board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| A record of testimony for tonight has been recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9231)|
| 2:33:57| We have the legal question that's before us is should the sector plan be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9237)|
| 2:34:06| Now then, I need to pause and go back to something that I brought to the table last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9246)|
| 2:34:16| The question that should be before us tonight should be an affirmative question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9256)|
| 2:34:22| That being the motion should be stated as to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9262)|
| 2:34:31| It takes six votes to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| No matter how many people are here, it will take six votes to approve as opposed to a motion to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9274)|
| 2:34:45| in which if there are not six votes to deny, would that mean that the motion is then approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9285)|
| 2:34:54| and we do not need to find ourselves in that conundrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| I'm going to call on the law director to maybe agree or disagree with me at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9298)|
| 2:35:03| I absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| The Court of Appeals has been clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| It needs to be the affirmative vote of the membership to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| and just for clarity purposes, it helps the Court of Appeals and helps for the record and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9313)|
| 2:35:21| I would want to clarify that tonight this board sits in a legislative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9321)|
| 2:35:29| It's not as a quasi-judicial board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| Zoning land use decisions made by this board are legislative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| and I don't know if it makes a whole, whole lot of difference with respect to the standard of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9337)|
| 2:35:43| but when matters go up in court after you make a decision, if they go up into court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9343)|
| 2:35:51| it's a different type of action that's filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| But that action will be based on what's presented only here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| Well, the standard of review is is there any possible reason to support your decision tonight in the legislative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9358)|
| 2:36:09| If you are sitting in a quasi-judicial capacity, you will be limited to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| So it's a broader standard of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| Thank you for that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| I must first say that I am a retired telephone guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| I am not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| Commissioner Brown, if you'll wait until I get through with what I've got to say here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| I'm in the process of making a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| and I'd make the motion for the purpose of us being on affirmative footing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| and then the item will be up or down based on how people vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9405)|
| 2:36:51| As I view what is before us, the plat is showing 19 parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9411)|
| 2:37:01| It would be impossible for this piece of property that's being in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| to be a parcel on some other piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| It is inside this subdivided piece of real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9431)|
| 2:37:21| but the intentions that were to be determined about its usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| I think were left in limbo with the fact that it was not zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| It was left agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| and it could not be a piece of agricultural property of some other parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9453)|
| 2:37:42| I believe we've been asked a question about the lawfulness of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9462)|
| 2:37:49| to be a business that can be established in relationship to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9469)|
| 2:37:58| Really, though, we're questioned right now about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| Without the sector plan change, there will be no question about rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| and it's almost difficult in my mind to think that here is a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| and on one side of it you can have this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| and on the other side of the road you cannot have this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| Based on those three points, I believe that's where the staff came with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9503)|
| 2:38:30| and then the Metropolitan Planning Commission adopted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9510)|
| 2:38:37| to get this issue before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| It's not a question of homeowners' dues or parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| or an entrance on Choteau Road or an entrance on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9527)|
| 2:38:56| or does it have a residential look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| because those are items that we're not to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| Those are items that MPC will have in whatever the guidelines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| of this particular piece of property once any action is ever taken upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| I had a longer list of it's not about horses, it's not about signatures, it's not about plats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9556)|
| 2:39:22| it's not about other vacant land, it's about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| When I go to say that, I believe I've been on this particular corner with my staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9566)|
| 2:39:36| and I grin when I say that because that's my wife, and it's my wife because we're in her car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9576)|
| 2:39:47| In all the years that I've been out there, a hump in the road has been removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| sight lines improved, services have been added in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9592)|
| 2:39:57| One that was just before us not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9597)|
| 2:40:01| that's the county subsidization of a road to get a fire hall installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9601)|
| 2:40:08| The county's not subsidizing roadways in any other part of the county to install fire halls in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9608)|
| 2:40:19| and then the roundabout is an improvement of the intersection of the roads also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9619)|
| 2:40:26| Now, there are other things that go a long way with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| but in keeping with those short notes that I have and not saying how I may vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9629)|
| 2:40:36| I think it'd come upon me to move that this sector plan be adopted per MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9636)|
| 2:40:52| and we will now enter the phase of the commission deliberation about what might take place on this particular action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9652)|
| 2:41:05| and I recognize Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| Not to get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| I recognize Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| I'd like to relook at a statement you made a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| that this decision would only be made on what was put before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| If we don't do our due diligence in checking these things out on our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9686)|
| 2:41:31| plus the fact we had an hour and a half or more last month to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| so it's not just tonight's information we're going to be looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| If you don't get out and do your own due diligence and look at some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| like you said, you and your staff went out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| it's not just what comes before or said here at this meeting tonight that you make these decisions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9706)|
| 2:41:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9722)|
| 2:42:03| Just to clarify this, you've made a motion to approve the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| Changed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| And there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9730)|
| 2:42:11| We have not had pretty much an unwritten rule amongst the members here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| that if a zoning designation affects a particular commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| that that commission district representative gets to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| Were you intending to make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| We have an option to make a motion to approve or to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| We don't have to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| If we make a motion to deny and there's enough votes for that to sustain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9759)|
| 2:42:44| then the sector plan is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| And my concern is that if there are not enough votes to deny, then it would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| Then we redo the motion again to approve the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| You could do two motions back-to-back then, two votes back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| If one fails, you still have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| This is the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9785)|
| 2:43:06| And the advice given us by the law director was, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9786)|
| 2:43:18| Well, there is a motion before the board to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9798)|
| 2:43:24| In order for the body to take that action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| you need the affirmative vote of the majority of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| If you fail to receive an affirmative vote of the majority of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| then the matter is still before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| You should make another motion either to grant it or to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9818)|
| 2:43:45| or to initiate another sector plan amendment that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| I guess those are the only two options after a motion to approve fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| But the advice given a moment ago regarding the affirmative vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| is a requirement that you have an affirmative vote of the majority of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| in order to carry the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| If you don't have the affirmative vote of the majority of the members, then the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9845)|
| 2:44:10| But the Court of Appeals has said in order to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| it needs to see a majority of the commission vote in the affirmative to carry a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9855)|
| 2:44:24| But if it doesn't pass, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| You do not have to have a second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| You have to have a vote one way or the other, a positive vote one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| If you don't have a positive vote, you automatically have a negative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9878)|
| 2:44:43| If the motion is to deny and there are not six votes, then we're left with a conundrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9883)|
| 2:44:50| That's not the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| That's the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| The motion that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| I call for a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| We're not through with discussion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| I still have a light of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| We are in the deliberation phase amongst commissioners right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9907)|
| 2:45:15| Mr. Renter, will you continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| I'm hoping I can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| Recently, there was a case that went up to the Court of Appeals, Royal Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9919)|
| 2:45:25| I believe Mr. Seymour was involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| If I'm not correct, it was involved in the Pryor-Brown parking garage over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| A little different way it got to the City Council, but in essence what the City Council did there was they held a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| and less than a majority of City Council voted in favor of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9939)|
| 2:45:46| and it was announced that the motion failed and the appeal was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9946)|
| 2:45:54| Well, Mr. Seymour appealed that, went to the Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| and the Court of Appeals said the City Council should have had another vote that carried a majority of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9957)|
| 2:46:09| So if you all tonight make a motion one way or another, whether it's to approve or deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| and that motion fails to receive a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9975)|
| 2:46:19| then you should take another motion until you get a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| because that is the way that the court will look to your action to determine what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9983)|
| 2:46:29| We've not done that in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Anything fails, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| If it fails to pass, it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| If it fails to pass, it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=9997)|
| 2:46:45| We've never voted a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| Well, since the Royal Properties case, this has been our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10008)|
| 2:46:53| the Law Director's Office opinion, and the interpretation of the law in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| That case was decided in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10018)|
| 2:47:07| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| To be honest, practically speaking, there aren't very many options with the Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10028)|
| 2:47:15| Either you approve it with a majority vote, you deny it with a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| or you initiate your own Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| There's only three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Yeah, I didn't hear your answer to Commissioner Schoonmaker's question a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| when they asked you about the Commissioner of the District making the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10050)|
| 2:47:42| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| To Commissioner Schoonmaker about the commissioner whose district within which this resides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10063)|
| 2:47:52| was that the question needs to be phrased in the affirmative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10072)|
| 2:47:58| and if there are not six votes to carry it, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10078)|
| 2:48:02| If the vote is cast in the negative, excuse me, the motion is cast in the negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10082)|
| 2:48:08| and you do not get six votes to deny, does it become approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10088)|
| 2:48:14| And the answer is, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| We have to do something else after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| That's not an answer to his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| I've answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| How?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| I didn't hear an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| Did you, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| Point of order, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| I think we're out of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| No, I want to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| You want me to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| Please don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10121)|
| 2:48:48| I guess I'm a little confused because, again, like Commissioner Brown said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10128)|
| 2:48:57| we have typically, when a zoning item is in a commissioner's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10137)|
| 2:49:04| that commissioner has the right to make the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| If he does not want to make that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| then subsequently any other commissioner will have that opportunity to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10150)|
| 2:49:16| So that was the only reason because I was prepared to make a motion to deny the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10156)|
| 2:49:26| But since we have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| Commissioner Broyles, would you agree to withdraw the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| I didn't make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10173)|
| 2:49:34| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10174)|
| 2:49:35| She's got to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| She's the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| I'm the second, so I've got to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| Let me ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10179)|
| 2:49:46| If a motion is made to approve it the way it's written in our agenda and seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10186)|
| 2:49:53| can't just a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| That's the time that it's appropriate to make a substitute motion that states the opposite, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10195)|
| 2:50:01| Wouldn't that be the proper procedure rather than withdrawing this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| and doing a motion that is worded differently than what's in our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| That would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| So really what we need is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10213)|
| 2:50:16| And I guess a point of order, is that a rule or is that a practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10216)|
| 2:50:23| I don't think that's a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| We've heard a lot of statements thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| That's my point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| Well, if you've done it for eight years, it becomes a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| I'm not going to sit here and listen to chatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10236)|
| 2:50:42| So that's my point of order to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| Is that a commission rule or has that been a commission's practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10244)|
| 2:50:51| Regarding the ability of the district commissioner to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| The district commissioner making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| That's a rule that states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10256)|
| 2:51:02| Commissioner Broyles, my question to you still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| Do you wish to withdraw your second if I withdraw the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| I would like to ask to make sure that we do this in the most appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10269)|
| 2:51:14| I'd like to ask the law director, is that the appropriate way to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| or would doing the substitute motion be the more appropriate way to do it or does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10278)|
| 2:51:24| I want this to be done in the most proper way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| I have one more follow-up question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| Is that for us to do any kind of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| aren't we supposed to have a motion and a second on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| Technically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10297)|
| 2:51:41| However, with these bodies, a lot of times the way that motions happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| it's a matter of practice, not strictly by Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10307)|
| 2:51:53| Robert's rules are more adjusted to large assemblies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10313)|
| 2:51:58| This is not a large assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| So as long as it's clear on the record what this body intends to do, I'm comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10321)|
| 2:52:09| whether it's by withdrawal of the second in the motion or by a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10329)|
| 2:52:15| Of course, any commissioner is free to object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| Okay, so you're saying it doesn't matter, either way is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| Right, as long as it's clear on the record what the intent is with the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| It's clear that you have to have a motion and a second in order to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| And then if you take a vote, an affirmative vote of the majority of the commission will pass that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| Okay, so as long as either way is fine, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| I'm sorry, Commissioner Brewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| Were you zoned out a little bit there, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| As long as either way is appropriate, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10373)|
| 2:52:58| The question is, if I withdraw the motion, is it agreeable for you to withdraw your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10378)|
| 2:53:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10383)|
| 2:53:04| Okay, I withdraw my motion, and Commissioner Broyles has withdrawn her second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10384)|
| 2:53:11| and the floor is open for a motion so that we can continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10391)|
| 2:53:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| As the District 5 representative, I would like to make a motion to deny the Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10403)|
| 2:53:32| from LDR, Low Density Residential, to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| This is contrary to the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10417)|
| 2:53:45| Now, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| Okay, a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| That's what I was looking for, was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| Now we're then to discussion and deliberation amongst commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| Commissioner Oynbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| Okay, a motion's been made, but I wanted to say that if a substitute motion would have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10443)|
| 2:54:09| and it had failed, we would have filed back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| That way we would have covered both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10462)|
| 2:54:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| And while this is a, you know, it's one of these heart-wrenching, very difficult decisions, I think for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10468)|
| 2:54:35| there's some folks that I'm sure minds are made up both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| You know, I've heard several statements made from this body that the landowner has a property, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10480)|
| 2:54:53| It's his right to do what he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| I think Commissioner Brantley made that a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| Two, you know, we're very restrictive, and we don't want to be like the city in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10499)|
| 2:55:05| being such tight and such, you know, really, really difficult zonings that's not developer-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10505)|
| 2:55:13| So it would be good if we just had some consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10513)|
| 2:55:21| That way folks, developers, homeowners, would kind of know where we're standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10521)|
| 2:55:29| This is just kind of all over the map as it relates to how we govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10529)|
| 2:55:38| I would ask, you know, commissioners, if you believe in landowner's rights, you need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10538)|
| 2:55:45| Even if it makes a difficult decision, makes some people angry with you, be consistent with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| So that's kind of my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| And because I think in the end it's better governance, it's more consistent governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10553)|
| 2:56:03| and it helps us to tell the story of what we want our community to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10563)|
| 2:56:10| But if we're over here one way, over there the next way, it's just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| it's very difficult to gain an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10574)|
| 2:56:17| So, you know, I think this is a difficult vote, but I think it's also a very important vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10577)|
| 2:56:22| Because it says, there's been several strong statements put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| So if we're backing off of those now, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| Where do we stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| It's true I've probably said that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| However, this is the second meeting that I've not seen the homeowner or the property owner here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10601)|
| 2:56:47| and has not taken the time to come and express their view on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| I do, however, see about 200 people out here who have honestly expressed their view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| So I will accept that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10619)|
| 2:57:04| Further consideration or deliberation by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10624)|
| 2:57:10| Seeing no further discussion, we will roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| And I believe this is beginning with Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Can we restate exactly what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10643)|
| 2:57:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| Commissioner Thomas votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| Restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| We're voting to deny the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| So request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| I vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Well, I vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| I'd back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| It's a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10678)|
| 2:57:59| That's why you want a positive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| Commissioner Thomas votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10682)|
| 2:58:07| To deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10687)|
| 2:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| To deny, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| That's why I want it restated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| Commissioner Brantley votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| Commissioner Brantley votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| His chair threw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| See what I was saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10709)|
| 2:58:30| I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| I think I didn't have a cup of coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10718)|
| 2:58:39| We're voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10719)|

| 2:59:11| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10751)|
| 2:59:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| Commissioner Bessler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10762)|
| 2:59:27| Six to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| Motion carries six to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| To deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| To deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| So that eliminates the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10778)|
| 2:59:47| It deals away because you can't have it without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10787)|
| 2:59:53| The motion carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10793)|
| 3:00:00| The sector plan change is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| Now then, we're moving to the next item of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10804)|
| 3:00:08| which is the one that was moved to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| They want a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| I know, but they want a record of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| So that rezoning falls off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| Without the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10823)|
| 3:00:24| The clerks needed that on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10824)|
| 3:00:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10827)|
| 3:00:28| do you mind explaining to the public that this issue now is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| that there is not another rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| The next item is about rezoning, but it is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10834)|
| 3:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10839)|
| 3:00:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| We still have the item, which was moved to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| That being item four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160523?start=10858)|
