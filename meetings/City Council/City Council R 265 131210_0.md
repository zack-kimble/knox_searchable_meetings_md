| 0:01:34| Obviously, the mayor is not with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=94)|

| 0:02:07| So I don't believe she's going to make it back tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=127)|

| 0:02:13| Yeah, it sure does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=133)|

| 0:02:21| Obama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=141)|

| 0:02:27| selection speaks well on the city's work on sustainability issues and among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=147)|

| 0:08:07| But I did enjoy the support that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=487)|

| 0:08:18| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| I had one other thing, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| There will be a parade in East Knoxville this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| It's called Christmas from the East or Christmas in the East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| But that parade route will be from Johnny Gunn's mortuary down to Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| And that will be this Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| I think it's about the fourth year for that parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| And it's growing every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| So I'm sure I'd like to invite everybody to come out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=525)|

| 0:08:54| This is Thursday night at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| There's a six-mile bike ride for the Tour Delights and at least for Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| And this is where you come out and decorate your bike and decorate yourself in the holiday spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| and be judged, win prizes, and then go on a six-mile bike ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| So everybody's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I'd also like to announce we'll have the swearing-in ceremony December the 21st in this room here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| beginning at 10 a.m. of the five council members that were just re-elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| So we'll look forward to the festivities of that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| And I'm seeing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| A day is a resolution confirming the appointment of Robin Hoods to the Record Services Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Yeah, the mayor's not here, but I assume that we have Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| Have you taken any progress on this kind of crazy booting program that goes on along the downtown parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| where they get those $150 boots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Yeah, we have made some progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| The booting companies have come to the Record Commission a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| The complaints that have been made, KPD has done a really good job of investigating all those complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| The last I talked to Tracy Hunter, Sergeant Hunter said that of the ten complaints they had gotten or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| that all of them had checked out to be valid bootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| So the Record Commission, though, if you do have a problem, that is a place where you need to come and voice your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| But we have been working with the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| They are taking up the issue, reviewing it, and getting all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| But at this point in time, they have not recommended any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Is there any progress on the idea of not having more than one boot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| The reason they have more than one boot really has to do with the mechanism itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| It's not to charge an additional fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| There's only one flat fee regardless of how many boots you have on your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| What fee is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Seventy-five dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| They don't double it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| No, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| No, there's only one fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| It's $75 regardless of how many boots you have on your vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| There's been a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| 9A is an ordinance to amend and restate the supplemental plan provisions of the City of Knoxville Employees Pension System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| so as to affect certain requirements under the Internal Revenue Code to maintain the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| as a qualified governmental pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| and to establish those operative provisions of Division H that are required to be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| pursuant to the charter of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| I would like to move for approval on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Let's have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Well, I appreciate the opportunity to postpone this two weeks ago so we could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| I got some more information and certainly we've been provided a lot more information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| And as I understand it, I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about pensions two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| and honestly, that was my first round and about with pensions and talking about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| And it's still very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Pensions are very complicated in how they factor in the laws, the state laws, the ordinances and the combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| But this, as I understand it, this is about people living longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and using that in the assumptions that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Pensions is all based on formulas and it's based on a lot of assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| And one of the assumptions is they're going to live so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| and now they're living two and a half years longer than we thought they were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| And I'm supportive of that and certainly with the information we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| And I talked to Kathy Azlinger this morning about it at quite length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| But I guess and what she told me was that these calculations that it's not that we're paying out more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| As I understand it, it's just that we may be paying it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| And if we do pay it longer, these are the tables that we're going to use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| She tells me that those have already been factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| And when we start looking at the unfunded liability, that this has already been calculated in that total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| And I guess that's really the biggest question that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| I don't have any question about this as much as that this is something that we need to bring back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| And are there ways, the bigger question I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| are there anything that we can look at in the current plan that we could save money on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| And maybe we can, maybe we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| But I think it's something we need to readdress in 2014 and bring the pensions back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| and make sure all our calculations and tables are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Well, as the background says in your packet and you've seen online from Ms. Azlinger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=827)|
| 0:13:55| this is something that we have to do every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| And it turns out this time we had not, excuse me, had an actuarial update in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| So we asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| And obviously, people, as you indicated, are living longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| I mean, insurance companies do this all the time with mortality tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And that's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| So there's not a whole lot we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| That's just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| But all of these figures, whether they be in this and the mortality tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| or the various actuarial reports that we get are all just very educated guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=863)|
| 0:14:32| So this is what we may pay out over whatever the time period is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| We don't know that until somebody actually retires and then death occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| You know, it is, as you said, a very complicated business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| So this is something we need to do to make sure that we are correct with the Internal Revenue Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Councilman Downville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| I heard our attorney, Mr. Swanson, describe this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| I was watching it on the tube as opposed to being here because I had a cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| But I understood his presentation to essentially say that the tables try to reflect experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| but the reality is the payment base is based on actual lives and how they play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| So by adopting a correction to the table, I think we are simply trying to recognize what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| and be more accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| There was a nice question raised, I think, by Marshall Stare and the young lady that was at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| and that was, was there going to be an additional cost if the disclosures in the new table, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=937)|
| 0:15:46| encouraged people to make different selections in their benefit choices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| And I understood her to say that there was some dollar figure difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| but it really is done to recognize the mortality rate or age that the actuaries use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=954)|
| 0:16:02| And so this process is just to make it accurate to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| That's what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| If there's any more information, I'd love to hear it, but that's what I picked up from the tube anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| Yes, Mr. Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| I'd also think it was good that we postponed it two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| and I've learned quite a bit about what is going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| It's not exactly as Councilman Della Boppi said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| The increased liability has to do with people are living longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| but if you choose to have someone, a beneficiary, and not just to have the payments to yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| then they have to evaluate the value of your benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| So if you're living longer, there's an increased benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| So if you have that given to, it's supposed to be equal if you give it to a beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| So that amount is increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So there is a real cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| So my concerns were twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| One, what was the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| And two, why was there not an increased funding mechanism to counteract that increase in real liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1018)|
| 0:17:08| And I've emailed with the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| And the estimate, when I asked for an estimate of how much this would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| he said it would cost between $20,000 and $25,000 just to have a study to figure out how much this would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1041)|
| 0:17:35| But that if he had to estimate it without doing that, he said it would be between $600,000 and $800,000 over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| So that's one of my questions was roughly answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| In terms of why this isn't going to be reflected in the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| he basically said that we traditionally have not reflected future benefit form elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| so when people choose different forms in the valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| So that troubles me somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| His explanation is that that requires a lot more actuarial work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| And to basically reduce his own cost to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| he doesn't do that because it's such a relatively small impact on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1098)|
| 0:18:27| But in terms of what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| basically we're just making sure that people that make a different selection from the normal benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| it's mathematically equal to if they just took the normal benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| And if we didn't do it, and he explained this, and Ms. Isengard did as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| he said that while it's not required for the IRS legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| it could create other potential legal issues with our system if it's not actuary sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| But, anyway, I just like, I mean, I'll be voting for it, but I just wanted to put this e-mail on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| Let me recognize Councilman Del Lope again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Yeah, I was going to just footnote on what Mr. Wallace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| and that was because this is somewhat complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| and even though we got in up to our boots there for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| it probably would be prudent sometime early next year to ask the actuary to visit with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| and just go over this so we get our focus on this as we look at the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| and the cost increases going downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| So I would recommend we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| And let me go back to the, there was a motion to amend the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| We also need a motion to do it on emergency, if you so wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| I can't do all that in just one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| We first need a motion to amend to make it the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| That's the one we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I will make that motion to provide the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Is everybody clear here we've got a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| And then a motion to do this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| I mean, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| And now we have to vote on 9A as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Oh, we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Times two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| So all those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| 11A as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Segal Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| for the preparation of a compensation study in amount not to exceed $215,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Steg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| I am certainly for competitive pay and analyzing data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1252)|
| 0:21:01| but I have concern about this for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| First, you know, $215,000 seems like it's a significant amount of money to study our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1266)|
| 0:21:16| And two, and probably more importantly, given the financial status of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| I don't know if it makes sense to do a study which might call for significant salary increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| when we're just not in a position to increase salaries more than the 2.5% we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1288)|
| 0:21:37| I mean, I think we shouldn't forget that right now in this budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| we are using $6 million of rainy day funds to pay the annual pension contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1301)|
| 0:21:50| So we're using rainy day funds to pay a reoccurring annual expense of $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1310)|
| 0:21:59| I think, you know, to me, it doesn't make a lot of sense to do a study that may call for higher salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| when we're just not going to be able to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| I mean, that's certainly $6 million a year from that rainy day fund for an annual expense is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| I think it makes sense to postpone this for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| That will put in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| We'll have a better idea of next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| If that budget is more balanced, then maybe we could go forward then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| So I would make a motion to postpone this for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Is Vicki Hatfield here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I don't know if she's in the audience or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Yeah, Vicki, in reading this material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| it says that you do an annual study of the general government, police and fire every year to look at wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| and that you look at as many as I forget if it was 80 or 100 cities that are supposedly comparable to ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| in terms of what their payments are and their benefit costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Could you just tell us what you do and how this will be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| And I can speak to some of Councilman Steyer's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| This is different than what we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| We are compelled by charter to do a survey every year, and that is something my office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| What we do is we just do a survey of base pay because we simply don't have the in-house resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| to value anything other than base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| But as we all know, there are a lot of other things that our employees receive as compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| There are a lot of additions to base pay, supplements, allowances, tuition reimbursement, educational incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| We don't account for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Also, our benefits package certainly is a portion of total compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| So when we do our survey every year, we're only looking at base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| We're also very limited in scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| No matter how many we send out, we're only going to get a certain number back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| and that number hangs right around 45, 45 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So we're basing any –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| So you might send out 100 and get 50 back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| If we're lucky, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| And it takes months of, you know, harassing other municipalities to get that many back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| So we're basing our information on a limited pool of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| So basically what we do every year is we just take a look at base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| We compare base pay to other municipalities, a very limited number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| So we have a small amount of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| And you'll notice every year what we bring to you in the class comp ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| are very small conservative adjustments, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| If you actually look, since Mercer, we've recommended almost no adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And that's because what we did in 2008 was so comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| that it basically left us in a very good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| What created the need in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| and the reason that was such a comprehensive endeavor and it was so expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| was because we had spent so long only doing these small surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| these small adjustments, and over time you drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And what we basically, civil service and the administration in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| when we invested so much time and money into doing the Mercer plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| we made an agreement that we would try to do a more comprehensive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| of total compensation for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| basically get more information than we're able to get with our custom survey we do each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| get a bigger pool of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| You know, consultants have access to a lot more data than I have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| So in looking at those two things we can see, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| if every five years we're just making conservative adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| let's make sure every five or six years let's do a more comprehensive view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| and make sure we're not starting to drift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| because we don't ever want to get in the position we were in in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| We don't ever want to have to make large financial changes to our compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| And I'll be honest, I do not expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| That's not, we're not doing now, we're not proposing to do now what we did in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| 2008 was a complete redesign, overhaul, and a review of every individual salary in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| This is simply an expanded version of our salary survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| so that we can take into account total comp, look at that whole package again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| and just make sure the conservative adjustments we're making aren't causing us to drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| What did the Mercer study cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Overall, I don't know what the, I know what we paid them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| I don't know over the three-year period what that total amount was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| We can probably get with Jim and get that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Was it more or less than those $215,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| The cost of the survey itself, it was a little more for the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| but then we spent a significant amount adjusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| On consulting fees for adjusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Yeah, the consulting fee was, I think, right at $225,000 when we did Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| Do you also look at private sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| We try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| That's another advantage we will gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| I can request data from private entities all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| They will not give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| They are very proprietary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| They're private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| They don't have to tell us, and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| So we do survey private entities every year, and we cannot get data back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| I think we did get one, which was really unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| I think we got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Maybe Barge Wagner responded to us last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| But they don't do that because they don't want us competing with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| so they're not going to give us their data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| How come our benefit packages are higher than private sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| You know, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| When we did the survey in 2008 and they did a total compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| they found that for general government our benefits package was pretty well equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| and that we had a slight advantage in police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| and that was mostly due to their rich pension benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| So that's actually something that would be interesting to know this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| is given the new structure of the pension benefit, how does that affect total comp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Did you participate in the selection process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Is there a reason we have a Washington, D.C. firm that has sort of the land of milk and honey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| as their background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Well, we really didn't have anyone that was local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| Is it a specialty thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Yeah, and really the primary selection criteria that makes it a little, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| the most difficult is that doing that total benefits valuation is not something that many consultants do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| As opposed to just base salary, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| And actually of the respondents we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| at least two of them could not demonstrate that they had ever done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| or knew how to do a total benefits valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| So it's a very unique skill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| It's not one that most consulting firms do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| And so you have to find those firms that have that expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| And there was a big difference in the ones that could do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| and the ones that had not done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| But no one was very close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Councilman Starr, I respect your concerns about our financial security going down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| I'm guessing that Councilman Grieve shares some of those concerns too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| And I also am concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| But at the same time, we really need to remain competitive in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| to attract the best and the brightest people who will serve in our uniformed forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| and in our general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| And if we don't really know what the range is for the full package of an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| I think it's difficult for the mayor and the city to meet expectations down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| So I would not support a postponement of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I think we need to go ahead so that we can have the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| and the mayor can begin to make plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| We can see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| We may be much better than we think, or we may be really in a pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| So I think that it would be a good thing for us to not postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| to proceed with this tonight, with authorization of this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| And I have to tell you, Stair caught my eye at the expense of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| and shared a couple of emails with Vicki back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| But upon further review, I mean, you had 1,600 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| You've got a number of complicated levels of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| You can't fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| I mean, this is you've got to – your employees are our number one asset that we have in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| You can't fall behind and just ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| I mean, this is what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| We give service with people, and people is our biggest expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| and will continue to be our biggest asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| So I think you've got to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| It doesn't mean that you're going to automatically jump up and just get caught up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| but you can't allow yourself to get further behind than you have in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| where you're really playing catch-up for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| So I think it's the right move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I think it's a smart move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| We've done every five years, so it's about $40,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| And I think it's probably a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Councilman Griggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I think that, you know, whether we wait another six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| I mean, we've waited five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| So another six months is not going to cause that much of a problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| And I think the other thing, too, is that I don't think that because of waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| that we're saying anything against the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I think we all agree that we have good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| But also I think we need to think about our taxpayers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| They're the ones that are footing the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| And so I think what Councilman Stair has to say is pretty valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| And I think we need to be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I think we need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| I think we need to look at what the average city employee pay is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| and what the average city employee's benefit package is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And let me tell you, it's a lot better than a lot of those folks out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| that are paying taxes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| And I just think that we ought to be cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| and be concerned about how much money we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| And $215,000 is not a small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| The other thing is, did Mercer apply for this also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Were they that much more expensive or why were they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| They were not significantly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I think they came in about the same they did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| But just to be honest, Siegel's methodology was much simpler, much cleaner, more to the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| more what we were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Mercer did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| They seemed to be going toward what we did last time more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| a grand, comprehensive, we're going to rework everything, reinvent the wheel kind of approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| And that's really not what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| We really just want to do a comprehensive check, make sure we're where we think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And to be frank, I think we're good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| but we want a more comprehensive review to make sure that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Yes, Vicki, I just wanted to be clear on the study, the Mercer study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Are you saying you have that we have not had a compensation study against the Mercer study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| or is it done more often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| What's the in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Civil Service does a salary survey every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| We actually do a simple survey of base salary where we send out about 100 surveys to municipalities, counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1983)|
| 0:33:12| We do try to get some private data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| We get about half of those back, and we compile a report every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| It does give us good data, and that's why I don't feel like we're going to be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| I don't feel like there's some horrible thing we're going to find out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| But sometimes we do need to step back and look at a bigger picture than we're able to look at on an annual basis to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| because if we wait 10 or 15 years in between doing that, you may lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| If you are losing ground over that significant period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| you're going to lose so much ground that when you do have to catch up, it's going to be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| And to me, it's better to bite off little pieces as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| And if we decide to postpone for another six months, what effect, in your opinion, is that going to have on this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2031)|
| 0:34:02| I don't know that it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| I mean, to be honest, doing it now versus postponing it for six months, if we postpone it now, I'm going to, for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| I'm going to be four months behind on trying to do the salary survey, because that usually goes out in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| But to be honest, we've already looked at this timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| This should have gone out in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| So as it is, at best, we're going to be sending out a survey sometime in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| We're on a different time schedule than we usually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| You'd have to be on the time schedule we're usually on for this to be proposed in the class comp ordinance that I do in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| It's unlikely that the results of this, if there are results that would have financial impact, that those would be ready in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| So it would probably not be on this budget cycle, even if we do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Let me ask you, Ms. Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| I mean, this is not a binding deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| I mean, if you do the survey, it's still not binding on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| This is no different than the survey I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| It's just more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| So if I did the survey, let's say we don't bring Siegel in, I do the survey, the same thing is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| I'm going to, based on the data I have, make recommendations for anywhere that I see we need adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| You will accept or reject those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| If Siegel does it, they're going to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| They're just going to have more data, and we're going to have better data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| But still, they'll just make recommendations, and you'll either accept or reject those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| And, you know, I'll agree with what I think Councilman Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| But if we wait, I mean, we got ourselves in a pickle because there was years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| I know going back to 1995, I don't remember us up until that time Mayor Haslam started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| I don't know that there had been one done in that however many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| And we did fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| We do owe it to two people, to two sets of groups of people, the taxpayers and the employees, because, as was stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| the employees are, you know, the best asset, the greatest asset that we have here as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| But we also owe it to the taxpayers for them to allow the mayor and her staff to create as good a budget as they can moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2174)|
| 0:36:24| Again, this is not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Anything that is found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| And she was very open in her budget address this year that this was going to be included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| So I say, you know, instead of moving it forward six months, we should have been discussing this about six months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| and not approved it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| So I'm not going to support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| I think it is the right thing to do, and I hope we'll move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I certainly agree with a lot of things people said tonight about staying competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| In terms of the timing, I was just reading on page 275 about the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| and the response from the administration to the first question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| we are constrained by the city code to provide recommendations for adjustments to compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| planned to the mayor's office along with associated costs no later than March 1st of each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| so that changes may be incorporated into the budget, which is set by April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| And so I was under the impression that that's why we were doing it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| so it would be incorporated into the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| You know, again, I'm not – it's been five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I'm just asking for a six-month postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| And it's exactly like Vice Mayor Powell said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| It's not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| If the study comes out and it shows our salaries are too high or just right, probably no action will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| If they come out and show they're too low, we're just simply not going to be in a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| and we've created a problem potentially with our employees that feel that they might be underpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| and we're just not going to be in a position to change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| given the fact that, you know, this year we're taking $6 million to pay the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| The pension cost is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| I mean, I just don't see a scenario where we're going to be able to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Just having the study, I don't see what benefit that does if you can't take action on any of its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| But anyway, I'll go ahead and be quiet now, but that's just my thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| that postponing this when we've got a better idea of where the budget makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| And it's real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I mean, this is $215,000, which is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| You know, I wouldn't be saying this if it was significantly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Vicki, the question I had, you said that you do a study, and what you're looking for is a more comprehensive study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| Is there someone out there that you can't hire for $75,000 or $80,000 to help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| Well, just to be frank, the proposals that came in, the ones that we did have two that offered to do it for $75,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| but they offered to do exactly what I do for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| So we weren't gaining anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| So what you get for $75,000 is what we can already do on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| So the answer to that was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| No one was willing to do it for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Tom, pull your ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| There's no one out there that you can hire for a consultant for a year or something like this to work with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Possibly, but that's not typically how it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Typically a consultant is going to be representing a firm, and they're going to come in and do it on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| So the motion before us is to postpone this ordinance for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| And there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| So all those in favor of the postponement say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Well, let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| This is to be in favor of the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2398)|

| 0:40:02| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| It fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| So it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| So I would be looking for a motion for approval of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I said order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| You already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| All those in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Let's just do another roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2434)|

| 0:40:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2459)|

| 0:41:40| I guess I might ask this to Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Was some of this type of work done before by in-house, by our land-use folks, or has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| this always been contracted out, this idea of right-of-way acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Well, Jim could probably answer this in more detail, but in the past it's been a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| of both in-house and we've also consulted with a right-of-way consultant and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| had a contract very similar to this one that just ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Yeah, I didn't know if Lee Miracle's departure or something had to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| This is the number of right-of-way acquisitions that we have to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Lance Campbell, who has taken Lee's position, is working on right-of-way acquisitions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| smaller projects such as sidewalks and some other projects that engineering works on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| but this one, a lot of this I think is going towards the Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| Correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Just about every, I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Just about every project we do requires some level of right-of-way acquisition, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| it's permanent or temporary easements, and it's just been in the last five years that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| this process has become so demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Because there are more requirements or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Because there are more requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Previously you didn't have to provide all of this information to the landowner to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| them fully aware of all of their options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| In the past, if somebody wanted to give you the land, you'd say, fine, sign here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Now you have to say how much it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| They have to fully understand what they're giving away before we're allowed to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2594)|
| 0:43:26| Did you voluntarily tie your hands behind your back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| Well, there are federal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| That are imposed on you as part of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Whenever we get federal money, then we have those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| We've also adopted those requirements internally, partly to keep us from getting in trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| if we want to spend money on that particular area in the future, federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| We will never be able to spend federal money again in that area if we have right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| that is not obtained by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| So you end up having to adopt their standards just to ask for money in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| And arguably, it really is the right thing to do from a property rights, property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2653)|
| 0:44:23| just a fairness perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| So, yes, we've taken that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| This is to replace a contract that I think you all voted on just about two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| We used the whole capacity of the $300,000 for a lot of big projects and a lot of small projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2681)|
| 0:44:50| I mean, it's sidewalks, it's Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| You're saying there's nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| We're actually doing this now, and this is just getting a new contractor to help us do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| This is also not $300,000 separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| This is paid for by the budgets of each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| So this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| It comes out of the project budget as one of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| So this is not a separate line item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| This is already covered by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Cost of doing business of a particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Yes, by the project budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Why don't we take another vote on that just for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| So all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2732)|

| 0:47:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Mr. Modello-Boppi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Yes, I had a call into Joe, but he was on the road or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Maybe Christy or someone else can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Jim, it sounded like we inadvertently let the lease lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| Is some of this money going to go to pay back payments that are owed or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| I noticed that we had a repeated four- or five-year lease, and then something happened in 2009 where we kind of missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| the stitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Is there any money in here for back payment, or where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| The lease did lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| We do need the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| This is the only ballpark that we don't own, which is very different than some of the other recreational ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| I'm not quarreling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| In other words, do we owe them back money, or do we pay money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Well, we have talked about that, and we have talked about how we're going to settle that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| We've not come to full terms with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| But, yes, there is three years that they should have received a $3,500 lease payment amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| So our objective is to make them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| We'll just have to pay that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Okay, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| 12A is an ordinance to make the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Articles 2, 4, and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| regarding definitions and development standards for small breweries, wineries, and distilleries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| in certain commercial and industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Can we combine 12A and 12B since 12B changes some of the exhibits to 12A, or how do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| Someone needs to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| We're approving something, and then MPC said, oh, gosh, we wanted to change at least exhibit A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| and maybe some other parts in there in terms of how we did this, and I don't know what's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| Mark, do you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Yes, this is a two-parter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| The second part is as a result of City Council's referral of the original recommendation back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| to amend a couple of provisions, so the second item amends two of the exhibits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| and I'm not sure what exactly is the best process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| I think if you approved A, you would be approving an exhibit B and exhibit F that ultimately will be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2963)|
| 0:49:33| if you then approve B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| We looked at trying to combine it, and it became just so complicated and so difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| We decided procedurally it would be much easier for everyone to just do first one and then the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| and then we'd be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| I didn't know how we'd handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Oh, we've got a request here from Patricia, I guess, or an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| She wanted to ask us to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=2998)|

| 0:50:09| I think that's an old e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| That's an old e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| That was the first time it was on the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| That was the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| We're on 12A then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| We have one person that's signed up, Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| Mr. Vice Mayor, thank you, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Drive in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| I'm here tonight representing the position of the community forum organization on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| We have no problems at all with breweries and beer pubs and all of this, except for one small item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| and that is they are included in several zones in this ordinance, and one of them is the C1 neighborhood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| And we don't think that's an appropriate place for a brewery that serves beer on premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| and would most likely be coupled with a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| C1, of course, is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| And let me make this very personal in explaining it citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| On Merchants Road, we have a strip of C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| It starts at Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| It goes about 1,500 to 2,000 front footage, and there are all kinds of businesses already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| We've got a veterinarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| We've got a hair salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| We've got a barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| We've got an insurance office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Typical neighborhood commercial things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| A large brewery, if you want to call it a brewery or a brew pub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| or we call it different things out on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| This is in the heart of our residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| Its natural base of customers is already there on the other end of Merchants Road down by the expressway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| and it's not a pretty sight down there many nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| It's the last thing we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| We didn't object to the C1 zoning when it happened because we understood what was allowed and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| By putting brew pubs in here, you're changing the rules, and we don't think for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| And it's not just this one stretch of C1, but it's all over the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| We have no objection to brew pubs in any other zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| So is that Exhibit A we're looking at with the brew pub?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| Mr. Ammons, is that B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| Do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Hello, I'm Rick Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| I'm the downtown coordinator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| We've had a lot of requests over the last year for breweries, brew pubs, distilleries, all these types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| and that's why that's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Mr. Donaldson can maybe explain the definitions better, but a brew pub is really a very small entity of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| I mean, the breweries are the big industrial places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| The craft beer, craft wineries is really what we were trying to get at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| And so the C1, you know, issue really didn't come up much with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| but it just seems to me that a brew pub is a very small accessory used for a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| It's useful to review, I believe, as described here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| So it's not a given that it's in these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| And, you know, I've heard it described, and there's actually quite a few folks here in support of breweries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| guys that are wanting to do these types of things in the audience right now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| And it just seems like an economic driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| I mean, some neighborhoods, Sequoia Hills maybe would be a great place for a small restaurant, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| with a downtown grill-type vat that makes their own beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| So I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| It's not a huge deal for us, but I'd just like to make that clear, that that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| maybe it's not as bad as some seem to think, and it is useful to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| And maybe Mark can explain a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Quite literally, this provision about brew pubs acknowledges what's already going on in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| that brew pubs have been allowed as an accessory used to restaurants throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| So we're simply acknowledging the reality that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| By definition, a brew pub, the production component of a brew pub is accessory to the balance of the eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3256)|
| 0:54:24| and drinking establishment, so it's kept in proper proportion, incidental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| and subordinate to the balance of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| And in the C-1 zone district, all eating and drinking establishments are already a use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| so you get several layers of protection, so to speak, in the C-1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| I had heard quite a few concerns, including Mr. Redman's, but the fact that it is use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| I'm pretty comfortable that the people who are concerned about this will not be shy in making their concerns aware to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3298)|
| 0:55:08| should there be an application for a brew pub in one of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| that is not comfortable with that concept occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| So I sympathize with the concerns and I understand those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| but I'm greatly comforted by the use-on-review and the vigor of those who are concerned to be there if it's intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3322)|
| 0:55:32| Mr. Redman, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| I won't waste council's time by talking about the benefits of a good stout or a lager or a chardonnay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| That's not what we talk about on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| And that's where the customers, for one, in our neighborhood are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| And we can talk about the value of use-on-review all day long if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| The easiest way to keep it out of C-1 is don't let it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| So let me ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| What if it were out of C-1, Mr. Donaldson, but someone came in for a variance or other application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| In other words, is there more than one route to this process as opposed to generically allowing it as a permitted use or a use-on-review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3375)|
| 0:56:26| Currently, eating and drinking establishments are a use-on-review in the C-1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| So if there's already a restaurant approved as a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| Then it can follow as an accessory, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Today, they would be allowed to develop a brew pub without this provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3398)|
| 0:56:46| according to the past record of the city permitting and inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| We have numerous brew pubs within the city, all accessory to restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| So the practice has been to approve a brew pub as an accessory used to a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| We're simply acknowledging that with this, that a brew pub is a type of restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| where the production of malt and liquors is accessory to the primary function as a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3430)|
| 0:57:18| And the reality is if it isn't allowed there, they can still have a truck pull up to the back door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| and load up beer and wine and serve it in their restaurant because that's the thing that you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| So it's just a question of whether you brew it on premises or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Whether you drink local brew or imported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Except from Milwaukee, remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Zoning Regulations Articles 2, 4, and 5 regarding definitions and development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| for small breweries, wineries, and distilleries in certain commercial and industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Zoning Regulations Article 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| to create a new Section 5.6 entitled CO1 Corridor Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Councilman Delvault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Yeah, I have two points perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| One of them is simply a technical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I noticed in Subsection F4, that's on Page 2 of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| it uses the term certificate of appropriateness even though elsewhere they were crossing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| And I think the scrivener missed that reference since they picked up with development plan renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| So if we're going to pass it, we should make Subsection 4 conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| The second one goes to the merits of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| And as you read the MPC record, there was a nice question raised as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| or not approval solely in-house at MPC would have any ability to notify interested parties along that corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3542)|
| 0:59:13| or elsewhere in the city with the grant or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| And the review process, one of the things we raised at the outset when we sent it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| you know, it's triggered by a 10-day request by someone who's aggrieved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| but the nice question was asked, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| how will you ever know until the bulldozer shows up two months later to start moving dirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| So that was the question raised at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| And one of the commenters at MPC, I think it was Michael Cain, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| well, we'll just throw that into the council's lap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| but there is a nice question of whether if you're just someone who lives in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| and you see, in essence, something going on, it may be too late to appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| whereas if it were done by, I don't know, some other process, I suppose you could, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| the building official decides that it fits or doesn't fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| you could invoke your right to appeal to the BCA without a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Obviously, when projects get started, it's hard to stop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| But that question was never really resolved before MPC, so I don't know how we deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| Maybe Mark can tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| But in essence, it says by having a development plan with defined standards as opposed to general guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| we don't need a review committee made up of either citizens or experts or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| that would act upon notice with an opportunity for even non-applicants to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| That's the unanswered question in this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| They did do some good work fixing portions of this, but that question was never resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| So I don't know whether Mark or someone else needs to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| but I'm concerned that we haven't really answered the appeal process well enough yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| I'd be happy to answer that, and I think the statement that you read is, in fact, the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| By adopting standards with each corridor overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| you're simply replacing the standards for the basic zone district with a new set of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| Staff reviews permits and projects according to standards, and it makes approvals on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| And there really is no opportunity to apply discretion to whether a development plan meets the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| that have been adopted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| It's a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| Well, I thought the question was raised at the MPC that sometimes there are gray areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| If it was point blank clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| why doesn't the building official simply do it as part of his other reviews of setback or lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| or anything else that is specified in the set of standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| And I never saw that question really answered, but you're saying it's a routine staff activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| That's your answer to the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Yes, and the answer to the question of why doesn't the building official do it is because at the time that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| this process, they didn't have the manpower to do it, and MPC staff volunteered to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| We would be happy to give up that responsibility if so desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| How about flipping the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Is there some way to get at least public notice of the action out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| It's a basic permit process whereby it's triggered by an application for a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| The building official would then, if the project is within the area of an overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| send it down to MPC to review it according to the standards that have been adopted by the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3763)|
| 1:02:52| We then stamp it, whether it's been approved or not, and send it back to the building official to issue the building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| What about E-5, for example, in the ordinance that refers to signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| Is this to be interpreted that you could actually have a lesser sign restriction than the sign ordinance might provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| I mean, how does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| I understand if you have general rules and you have tighter standards for a corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| but what if the corridor standards are lesser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Have you, in essence, changed the sign ordinance, assuming we ever get one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Would you have changed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| The purpose of the overlay is to change either the regulations of either the basic district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| or the supplementary regulations which would apply so that an area, upon going through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| could decide that they wanted standards that were tighter than the supplemental regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| and adopt sign heights or sign areas that are less than those approved in the basic zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| Well, I understand tightening it up, but you could also loosen it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Is that the interpretation, that the standard could be weaker than the sign ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| One could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Basically, with the overlay being a provision of Article 4, the regulations in Article 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| trump the regulations in Article 5, which is where the sign ordinance is found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| So if you have signed standards in a basic district that are different than the standards in the supplemental regs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| the standards in the basic district prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| So, for example, we just adopted the Cumberland Avenue Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| and it provides for a couple of different sign types that aren't mentioned in the regular regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3877)|
| 1:04:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| So you're saying when you focus on some specific corridor, you set standards that make sense in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| And many cities use overlays simply to provide heights, maximum heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| that are different than the standard zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Many provide parking regulations that are different than the standard ordinance through the overlay process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| So it can be applied to any number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| The list in E is a suggestion of some of the things that we would want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| when we go through a process of determining the corridor-specific standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| I understood from – I think I understood, and that's why I'm asking the question –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| from the MPC exchanges that you're hearing or meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| that there would be public input at the time the standards are adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| but in essence not at the time you do this development plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| That's what we all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Ms. Wolman-Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| This is an improved edition of the earlier ordinance that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| I'm still concerned that once these design guidelines or development standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| whatever we're going to call them, are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and there is a public process for that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| but when a specific issue arises that there's really no public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| for people who are concerned, according to the ordinance as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| that the executive director of MPC or his designee approves or denies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| within 10 days somebody can appeal to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| and then the commissioners decide yes or no, and that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| Am I correct in that understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| We currently use that same process in the C6 zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| where MPC staff does a development plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| and signs off as to whether it meets the standards of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| Usually it's the applicant who appeals a denial on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| because our review is does this meet the standards, yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| If it meets the standards that have been agreed upon by everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| and adopted by the city council, then it proceeds to the building permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| If it doesn't, then the applicant has the opportunity to appeal our decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| as to whether we've interpreted it correctly, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| I look forward to having it established in these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| and that, too, is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| It seems like to me I don't understand how it would be different than historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| You've got boards of appeals to appeal it to and not just to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| That's one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| But I want to go back to the sign issue and what Della Vopi was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| They can't make it more lenient than the existing sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| They can't all of a sudden decide to have more lenient signs outside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| Are you saying they could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| I think technically they could, and it's not they, it's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| City council will adopt these standards as part of the overlay zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| We'll adopt them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| So if that were, in fact, the case, it would be in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| as we adopt the corridor overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| It seems like to me there should be some language to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| well, it can't be any more lenient than what is already the city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| We wouldn't want to be voting to go above that, it seems to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| That would be kind of crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| He was saying the specific trumps the general, as I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| That's what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| I'm saying, he's saying, but it comes back to city council for us to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| Why wouldn't it just say we're already agreed that it can't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| we can't trump what it already, the general, what it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| In essence, a corridor could have, could say we want 50-foot signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| and then we've already, and the ordinance says no, why would we agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| you know, we'd be voting on that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I mean, you're voting on the whole sign issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| I would just think you'd take care of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| And I'm not really sure I understand about how it's appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| I think there will be people that will say I don't want to be in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| I don't want to play by those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| Or I have an exception, and I want to be heard, and I want to appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| And they want to have a right, you know, the right to a fair hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| And I don't know how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| But my issue is with it before, and I think they're still unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Lynn Redman, again, representing the position of community forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| At the very best progressive thing that we'd like to see happen tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| we think this needs to be postponed so that not only council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| but the general public can perhaps learn a little more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| But I think one thing is very, very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| When you create these corridor overlays, you have the ability and the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| to dissolve any law or regulation in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| You want 100-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| You could theoretically, if you could get five votes, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| Will you have folks that will try?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Zoning certainly is very inflexible, and it's very complicated in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| We will certainly need more inspectors if we have special overlays on corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| with different regulations and different sign heights and different setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| Community forum says postpone the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Again, the major weakness, the hole that you drive the truck through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| is the lack of public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| These are serious things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Property owners may find themselves in a corridor that they maybe slept through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Maybe they didn't pay any attention to that letter when the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| and the standards were being set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| Right now, people buy property because they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| or have a basic understanding of what commercial zone they're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| what residential zone they're in on these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| That could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| We need to fully involve the public, and I don't think we're doing it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| We would ask you at the very best that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| if you consider this at all a tablet or postponement for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| I'm going to move to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| We may not pass this thing, but I'm going to move to amend that subsection F4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| to change the word certificate of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| which doesn't exist anymore, to a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| But that doesn't answer the question of what we do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| It's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| It's technically wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| That's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| All those in favor of the amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Then we're back to the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| Do I hear a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Oh, there is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Any further discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| There is a motion already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| I think Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Yeah, let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| By four, it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| 12D is an ordinance to close Johnny Majors Drive from Lake Loudoun Boulevard to Padhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Summit Street subject to conditions in authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| adjacent property owners, University of Tennessee applicants, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| You want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| Talk about them all, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| I am, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Who wants to talk first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| We have a number of street closures that are listed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| And the UT administration at this moment says that public access will not be blocked for any of these roads that are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| But an administration in two, three, five, six, ten years can ignore what this administration says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| And when these streets are closed, they can deny public access as well as inhibit the access of the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| KUB, and other agencies that need to access the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| And they can do this by installing barricades, removing pavement, or inhibiting access in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4459)|
| 1:14:29| A reason that is given to close these streets is that it will save the city a lot of money in sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| and roadway improvements and repairs and replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| At the same time, we're being asked to hand over city property without any compensation for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| These requests for so many streets and a segment of campus are troublesome to me as an elected representative and a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4486)|
| 1:14:55| No constituent has contacted me to support this turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| but I have heard from several people in various walks of life who are concerned and opposed to this turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4499)|
| 1:15:09| Now, Smoot Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| Now, I've struggled with quite a bit, and I, too, am worried about the public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| I think you probably have the police and fire down pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| It's CAT that I'd be worried about and that we take our CAT buses on to the campus now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| And I would like to hear from the University of Tennessee to say, you know, that will always be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4529)|
| 1:15:37| I'd like some assurances on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| I don't know if they're here, but that's probably my biggest concern, CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| Not CAT anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| We lost the CAT contract for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| Just buses in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Buses in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| We take our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| We take our buses on to the campus now, not driving around campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| but we drop off on the edges of campus, on to campus, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4557)|
| 1:16:05| Is that what we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Do we want to let UT, you know, paint the streets any color they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| I mean, the citizens of Knoxville don't understand that these streets, who they belong to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| and giving them that full right, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| I mean, it's a toss-up for me whether to support it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| But the one thing is, you know, what assurances can the city of Knoxville have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| that we'll continue to have access to these streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| Mr. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Jeff Maples, representing the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Let me first address the concern about CAT and buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| I'm sure those who have lived here for a long time understand, oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| you hear issues about parking on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| So if we suddenly restrict and do not allow any public access of buses on campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| what have we created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| You then create the ability of more people to have to bring cars to campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| which means we have to provide additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| I'm sure council understands you've dealt with this before, the cost of building parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| It's not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| It's about $20,000 per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| So it would not be in our best interest to restrict public transportation to bring people into campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| Then we would create another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| So I can assure you that would not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Again, I continue, with all due respect, I continue to be somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| I don't understand the public access question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Again, we are a land grant public institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| It is our goal and mission to create and bring people there to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| We have thousands of people come every year to visit the campus as possible students, parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| Restricting that would not be in our best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Again, we have concerts, theaters, the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| We have multiple events there all the time, which we invite the public to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| So not having public access, again, would not be meeting the mission and goals of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| So at no time would we ever restrict public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Again, as we went over this process last week at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| you saw the issue again is beautification of campus and doing things in a more timely manner for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| to address concerns brought forth by our students regarding sidewalk issues, road repairs, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| So I can rest assure you that restricting people to come to the campus is not in our best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| I think the other thing that, especially after they did their presentation last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| which I think was very helpful to all of us, and a number of these streets are in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| I think the other thing that we really need to understand is that, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| probably the university doesn't really have to come to us and ask us about these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| If the state wants to come in and take them over, is that not correct by eminent domain or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| They could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Well, both the city and the state have the power of eminent domain, but if the state wants it, they trump the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Well, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| So I think what we're looking at is that, you know, there is no guarantee, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| in terms of what's going to happen in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| but I think if you look at their plan in terms of what they're proposing with the beautification of these streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| and access and that sort of thing, I think that's the kind of commitment they're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| But, yeah, you know, two presidents from now, who knows what might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| But I think that in the long run, if you think about the advantage that the city is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| in terms of not having to worry about those streets and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| and it's my understanding, Mr. Maples, that you all have talked with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| and also with the fire department and this sort of thing in terms of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| so I don't really see – I think it's really to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And as far as getting something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| I think what we're getting is the fact that we don't have to maintain those streets and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| And police them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| That was the other big thing, too, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| And you two police would be the first responders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Yes, I think you just mentioned it in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| Have you gotten any input from students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Or is this something that students would not normally be interested in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| The students are interested in what we can do to beautify the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| That's always their number one priority, one of the things they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| We've had this discussion in multiple settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| So have we gone out and done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Have we done a survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| But I think by and large, oftentimes I get complaints from students again when they call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| concerned about a sidewalk that needs repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| And we tell them we have to go to the city and request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| They don't understand why there's a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| And we try to explain that the city has other priorities, a large area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| and that we are just one part, one community within the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| And so I think they would, by and large, would appreciate this approach because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| it would be on our part to make those repairs in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| Well, I've had two people to contact me, and they both were opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| And one gentleman, I don't know if he's here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| but he raised a question with me in terms of, you know, from time to time students have protests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| and they have demonstrations and their freedom of expression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| If the streets are owned solely by the university, would that right be limited, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4884)|
| 1:21:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Just ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| No, because they do most of those protests on university property anyway, not the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| Well, I was asked that question, so I thought I would ask it of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4908)|

| 1:22:31| Oh, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| I wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| All the same language would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| She's just telling you which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| So she's going to read it in an abbreviated fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| If that's all right with counsel, if you want her to read the whole thing, she will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| It's all subject to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| We were just trying to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=4965)|

| 1:26:18| Do you have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Jennie Robertson-Peek and I'm speaking for the property of 314 East N. Skiff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| MPC made a recommendation to exclude our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| There was a vote and they did make an amendment to the recommendation that there were six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| properties that were exempt from the rezoning and I'm here just to make sure in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| it does not state that these properties were exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| We understand, I'm a little confused about the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| because they did say, they made the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| that our property was exempt from this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| And the reason being, I understand what you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| as far as keep a community together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| and to recognize, preserve the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| but our family has owned this property for over 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| And my father, Glen Robertson was a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| and he was very involved in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| And so we understand what you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| but over the years, our property has been completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| enclosed with the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| There are, we are surrounded with three sides of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| and there's only two lots on our block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| One is a business and then our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| and this is from the railroad track to Coster Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| They will remain R2 and they're wanting to turn us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| into R1, which really doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| We are the buffer to that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| and we would like to just remain R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| We don't want to change to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| We have to look for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| We don't have any plans at this time to change anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| but we have to have, leave our options open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| We would appreciate you allowing our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| just to remain R2 along with the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| And I think that's a valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Mr. Donaldson, do you want to address her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| The map excludes those parcels, this cover sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| I'll be glad to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| I just wondered if we had one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| Yeah, there's four speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| I just felt like, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| they've waited through a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| It'd be great to have them speak and then I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| All right, Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Well, go ahead, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Thank you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| The Planning Commission did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| the removal of six properties from this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| They're listed in the ordinance by parcel number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| so the address doesn't jump out at people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| So it's in there but it's not listed as an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| And for clarification, those parcels are not included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| among those that are being changed here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Those were excluded at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| and they have come forward to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| with those same exclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Okay, then you want to go ahead, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Okay, Anita Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| She was a recent graduate Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| at the Building Stronger Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| And here she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| She's ready to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| My name is Anita Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| I live at 1107 Henrietta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| I am a member of the Inskipp Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| And I don't want to fight with my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| that want exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| I'm happy for what they want and I concede that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| I have lived in the Inskipp community for about 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| My husband and I have raised two children in our home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| Inskipp, and I feel that Inskipp has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| undergone a lot of changes, not for the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Inskipp has become too densely populated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| due to inappropriate development and outdated zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| There are too many apartments, condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| and duplexes currently in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Our streets are overburdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| There are too few sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| making it unwalkable and disconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Inskipp, I feel, has become unattractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Some apartments are inviting drug trafficking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| and prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| I feel that we need down zoning to stabilize our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| and preserve what neighborhood character is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| We have housing currently for all income levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| And I feel zoning shapes our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| Our remaining quiet streets need to be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| from further development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| And I feel that the line needs to be drawn somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| And I appreciate your allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5481)|
| 1:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Betty Jo, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5482)|
| 1:31:32| You'll give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| I think Betty Jo Mahan, 5325 Rowan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| Because Anita covered it pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| that we respect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| We want our community to be protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| but we also respect the rights of the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| And I really don't have anything more to add on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I have a lot of history and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| if people want to know about what was advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| We actually started the Inskipp Small Area Plan in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| And we did three community meetings then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| It went before MPC in March and City Council in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| So we had all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| And then for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| it was included in the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| as a recommendation for a general rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| in 2012 and 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| So by 2013, it was about time to quit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| just talking about it and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| And in May is when City Council did the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| requesting MPC to look at the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| And we did a phase one of about 208, 210,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| somewhere around their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| And there was notices in July of 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| July 22, 2013, and August 15 in meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| August 8 and September 3 and 17, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| So that was the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| That was up around the upper right-hand corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| is what I want to say, kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And I don't know how many of y'all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| the boundaries of Inskipp anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| but it's like, okay, the word has left me now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| but where they do a census tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| 40, would you like me to go over the boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| or is that clear in your map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| We got a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Anyway, so we did the upper right-hand corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| and there was no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| And then the rest of it we were looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| maybe doing it in two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| And it was like, no, let's just go ahead and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| because we're sending out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| we've been sending out newsletters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| That was the first attempt we had at newsletters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| And it seems to be working fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Though it's a lot of expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| because Inskipp really has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| I forget the exact number now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| around 2,100 or 2,300 people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| And we sent a newsletter to 1,650 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| just so, on this last rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| just so we felt like more people would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| And we had a meeting in October 22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| and Mike Steele was there because he lives in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| and he put a notice in the Focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| an article on the rezoning for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| And then on October 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| MPC did their regular letters and postcards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| to the 372 people that were actually being rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| because you obviously can't rezone the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| that was medium-density residential and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| It's just the residential is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| And then MPC had an information meeting on November 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| and then on the 14th we had in November the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| and then here we are at December 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| and as you say, it'll be the 1st of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| before the second reading if it passed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| So it has gone through a lot of advertisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| and making people aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| and Anita and I have done a lot of walking door-to-door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| to make people aware of the community anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| And what I'm finding is it is usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| a small group of people that does try to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| for the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| and that's what we're attempting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| And I think I'll just wait and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| if there's any other questions that you have specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| I appreciate your listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| Nancy Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| Nancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| You give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| My name is Nancy Jane Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| My husband and I reside at 1007 South Park Circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| and we own the property at 606 Glen Oaks Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| which is in the area that's being considered for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| We are obviously opposed to the rezoning of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| and we did request to be exempt from the R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| or the R1A rezoning and to remain R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| Our property is located in Moore Heights subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| which was former farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| that was owned by my husband's grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| James Irvin Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| And the farm included the area between Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| and Glen Oaks Drive, formerly called Helen Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| From our west property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| to the intersection of Bruin Road and Glen Oaks Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| My husband's parents bought this piece of the farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| that we still own in the 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| Our property is unlike that around us in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| It is 257 by 235 by regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| with a house located in the middle of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| I think we have approximately 1.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| The homes west of us are small with small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| The homes east of us are ranchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| with slightly larger lots in width than those on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| Since we have a much larger parcel of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| we would like to be able to keep our options open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| for future use of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Since two houses directly across the street from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| are already used for the care of mentally challenged adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| our property value has declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| If our land is rezoned to R1 or R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| our property value will decrease further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| because our options for the use of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| will be greatly decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Therefore, due to these circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| we believe that we are justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| in asking for an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Yes, there is an Inskip Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| and we had no knowledge of this whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| being in existence until July of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| And we received a newsletter through the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| about the association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| although they had been meeting for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| We had no knowledge of their existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| but since learning of the existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| we have attended several meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| and there have expressed our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| According to their president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| they have approximately 12 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| and we are very concerned that the future of Inskip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| is in the hands of a very small group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| The first meeting that we attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I expressed that repeatedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| that people who lived around us were like us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| and had no knowledge that any of this was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| that there was any talk of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| And I was very concerned that that was not publicly known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| And when I contacted a number of people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| I found of everyone I talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| only one person had any knowledge of the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Now, we have lived where we are since, I believe, 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| My husband has lived in Inskip since 1949.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| And as I say, I have lived there since 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| Yes, we do have problems, as any other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| We have some problems with the apartments, as was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| But this rezoning is not gonna take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| The problems that are there are going to remain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| And a number of the neighbors have asked me two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| What's behind all this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| And why are they so worried about us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| when we're surrounded with this apartment situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| My husband and I have raised three children in Inskip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| have invested a large part of our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| in working with recreational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| And in later years, I taught many of these same children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| We have always been participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| and supported our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| We're concerned about its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| We've had our property since the 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| We just want to be left alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| as we have for the last 64 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| to exercise our rights as property owners in an R2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| MPC approved this exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| and we would love for you to also grant us our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Very briefly, Mr. Mayor, members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| A representative of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| at 4227 Costa Road talked to Councilman Campin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| It is presently built with 20 apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| on a very small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| The downzoning would make, and it's zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| and that is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| The downzoning would make this property nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| and the property owner just wanted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| to bring that to council's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| And lastly, Debbie Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| Give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| My name is Debbie Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| and I'm the property owner of 4901 Costa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| and MPC exempted my property from the downzoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| and I just wanted to be sure that my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| is still exempt in what you all vote on for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| That completes the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| I wholeheartedly support this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| and respect the wishes of those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| that want to be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| You got to draw a line somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| and whether it's NSKIP, or Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| or Lonsdale, we don't need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| of poor plan developments to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| into these single-family areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| so I think what I'll make a motion to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| is send this back to MPC to include these exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| but put a use on review to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| for various quality upgrades or setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| whatever the issues may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| that if these are developed in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| they can at least have some standards set on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| but they would still hold the R2 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| so that's gonna be my motion to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| They can include the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| and I believe there were also some other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| that were medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| that will be included as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| since they would be impacted by this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| but I appreciate everybody who came here to speak tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| and wanted to at least give you a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| to voice your concerns while you waited so patiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| There's a motion, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Let's go with Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| I wanna make sure I understand what I have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| On this 200 acres, the zoning change to R1 and R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6170)|
| 1:42:57| affects the area on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| but that map is prepared to exclude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| at this point, six properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Is that correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| There were six properties represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| in the MPC recommendation, and by my record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| Mr. Seymour presented a seventh property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| Yeah, the 4227 coaster, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Right, and the map that will be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| will that have all seven exclusions shown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| Because what we're doing is adopting a zoning map, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| that designates the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Will the map show those six or seven exclusions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| Yes, in your packet, there is a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| with the six parcels shown, so we will add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| Add the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Seventh, and then we will add recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| as far as use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| and we'll look at some criteria for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| All right, but to address the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| of the people that spoke, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| 606 Glen Oaks is on there and is marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6240)|
| 1:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| All right, I guess I have one other question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| and that's the young lady that spoke second to the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| She had a number of reasons why she didn't know much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| about the community group and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| I understand your objection to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| that you don't want your parcel included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| but do you have objections generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| to the rezoning of the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| to tighter single-family residential zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| If you're excluded, do you care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| that the other ones are zoned single-family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| I do care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Yes, sir, I do care, because we didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| proper notification that all of this was in progress at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| Well, there's a small area plan, apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| that was approved two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| We had no knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| I think it started, like, in 2010, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| It was published on the internet, you know, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| And we had no knowledge, although we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| in the same house since 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| We had no knowledge whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Any of this was taking place until July of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| And yes, sir, I am concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| And no, I don't feel that it's fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| that 10 or 12, let's say 12 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| which is what their president said they had in their group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| can dictate what the rest of NSCIP can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| I am concerned for my neighbors as well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Well, she realizes it went before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| with a recommendation to review it and approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| and it's coming before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And I understand your personal view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| of protecting your zoning the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| and apparently that's covered in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| but I'm still not sure what kind of notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| you expect it to get, because they do publish these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| in newspapers before they have MPC meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| and they are posted on the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| And maybe you don't use the internet, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6349)|
| 1:45:49| I do not generally use the internet, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| But, excuse me, after the first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| that we attended, my husband and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| at the association meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| and MPC had representatives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| and I kept saying, my concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| that our neighbors don't know this is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| they have no knowledge of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| and they were ready to present it to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| It was ready to go to the commission and then to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| And so the MPC reps that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| someone, either they did it or someone else in authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| did send out information to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| and had an additional meeting at Inskip Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| and invited people to come so that word could spread better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| and further out than what it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| before they actually went to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| I just wanted to understand your position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| and that was your property and the general rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| and that was your position, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| Councilman Campin, would you like to recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Betty Jo, sure, if that's okay with the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Why would it have to go back to MPC to add a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| I'll let Mark answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| I think there's a significant enough change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Yes, that's a condition that MPC did not consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| during their deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Staff didn't present it as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| so in the minds of many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| it could be considered significant enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| to warrant a relook by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| Well, if he says so, I guess it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Mayor, I just want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| Pull your mic down, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| We're gonna send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| which means it will come up for the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| at our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| No. No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Okay, what's the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| We'll have to go through their process of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| well, give us a schedule in terms of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Mr. Donaldson, I'll let you answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| We may not be able to get it on an agenda until February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| which case it would come back to you in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| That's why I wanted to know what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| because it's not gonna be back here on December 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| Well, I'm not trying to speed this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| I mean, this should have been done a long time ago, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| but it's something that we're getting going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| and I want to make sure it's done right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| and I respect those people that want to opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| for an appropriate reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| I just think that the public needs to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| that we're talking March or April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| you know, before it comes back to get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| We recognize Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| I guess I want to understand that a little bit too, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| I mean, these properties, six, now seven properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| that want to be exempt, you want to send it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| I don't understand it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6534)|
| 1:48:54| you want to send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| which would give more time for public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| if they wanted it, but it would also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| you want to look at those exempt properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| and add, and for those properties, they're exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| but they've been also, they've been applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| in a use on review status for their property going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| They're not totally exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| We're exempting them, but we're going to potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| it's going to come back from MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| to apply a use on review to them to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| If changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| If changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| So it's going to be, it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| are you saying it would be down, it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| their zoning would remain the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| and then they would have a review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| they would have to go back for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| to use their property for the way it's currently zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| No, differently used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| That would be 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| I mean, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| So I mean, for the property that's zoned R2 now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| goes back to M, it still remains zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| and then you're potentially asking MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| to put a use on review to come back on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| and so it's still got some restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| that it doesn't have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| I just want to make sure, I'm not arguing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| That's how I interpret the intent of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| is for the Planning Commission to consider a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| that if the properties remain R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| they get conditioned with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| use on review process for any future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Okay, and what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| now the use on review process would entail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| public notice and the consideration of a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| development plan for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| prior to pulling any building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| So it provides public notice to the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| and requires the submittal of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| that's then considered by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| Since you're up there, Ms. Peek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| would you be, are you opposed to that, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| I don't understand with R2 how there could be restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| I mean, on R1A, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| that you do have to submit a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| but with R2, I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| the restrictions that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| That's still completely, you know, kind of tying this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| We don't have any plans for our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| but we don't want somebody to tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| you know, what we can or can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| when we already have businesses, you know, surrounding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| So the difference between R1A and R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| with the condition of the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| is that R1A would allow up to 12 units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| whereas R2 generally allows about 24 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| So it doesn't remove the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| to develop that at that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| It simply adds a development plan approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| Is that a normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| We have a lot of uses that are subject to use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| and more and more, that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| is being attached to general rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Yeah, I think you need to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| I mean, you've got a couple more hoops to jump through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| and a little more details to provide up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| and it doesn't restrict your use of the R2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| that you have, but you have to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| a few more questions up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| and make your case a little bit stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Councilman Delbo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Yeah, I wanted to ask, I guess Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| maybe Rob Frost, but my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| if this, in fact, is a significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| and needs to have a review and recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| from MPC, we would still have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| two readings after that, so it doesn't make any sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| to act on the proposal tonight as a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| We have to hear their view on the R2 change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| with use on review, and then we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| two separate readings after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6802)|
| 1:53:22| You're not permitted to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Right, under the law, you're not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| to consider it until you have the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| from MPC with regard to that particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| We're free to ignore them, but we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| not listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Sort of like George, I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| that the six or seven pieces, right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| the six or seven pieces of property are zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| that they can do, in other words, they're free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| And it sounds like, and correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| what we're doing, though, is we're sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| this back to MPC, and we are putting conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| on those people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| And it's like George says, I think they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| to understand that they're not staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| the way they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| They're gonna have conditions put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| But from what I hear from the folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| they don't want any conditions put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| They want to be left alone, just as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| So why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| Why are we putting conditions on those seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| pieces of property when they've asked to be exempt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| Right, well my intent is for whatever development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| comes forward in the future is more quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| more reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| It's not just, I mean, they can still do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| commercial development, they can build apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| but they will have to meet certain guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| and standards that fall under that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| It's not taking away their rights, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| but it just doesn't afford as much leeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| I guess, in quality, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| I would refer to Mark to explain the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| but that's my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| I mean, we could be, draw a harder line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| I mean, and say, sorry, period, without giving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| I'm just trying to give concessions to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| that want to exempt from it, and giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| that opportunity to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| I mean, frankly, the webs in the middle of a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| residential area, sure, they're lots bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| but where do you draw the line when you're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| to rezone property to sustain the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| of a single family community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| So that's my intent, is to give them a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| to maintain their R2 zoning, but with qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| that, as Miss Pete says, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| whatever her family decides to build in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| it will meet certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| I just want to make sure they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| that they don't go away from here thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| that they don't have any additional requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| If Mark would like to give a more detailed description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| of use on review, he can, I guess, for their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| I think the lady wants to maybe say something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| What is your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| I don't understand why that we would be treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| differently than the other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| who have R2 property in Inskip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| There are other R2 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| and why should we be singled out as being more restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| in any shape, form, or fashion than they would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| And is it not true that even other property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| with the R1 or R1A could ask for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| could they not, for specific rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| It would be more limited rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| but I mean, as far as just asking for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| As far as I know, anybody can ask for use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| for a property, right, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Well, with R1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| the permitted uses include duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| In R1A, the permitted uses include multi-dwelling structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| as a use permitted on review at up to 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| In R2, none of those uses are subject to any review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7022)|
| 1:57:10| So when you're starting with a land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| that is calling generally for low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| the condition that future development in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| be subject to plan review seems to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| But there are other homes that are R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| and I can't understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| that we would be more restricted than they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| And like he said, things that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| without use on review, then we're gonna be told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| no, we're gonna be treated differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| because we've asked to be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Well, you say there are other homes in R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| In Innskipp, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| Well, those are the ones that are being down-zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| to R1 or R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| Not all, not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Not all of those around Innskipp Baptist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| have been down-zoned from R2, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Okay, well, the ones that were put before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| as part of this rezoning plan were selected for a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| because they were in predominantly single-family areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| And if there were some that were exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| because they were already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| I would have to look at each in particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| But these six that we're exempting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| if you will, from the rezoning, I'm saying that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| I agree, but I think as a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| putting a use on review on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| just allows for further review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| of your proposed development in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| That doesn't mean you can't build duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| or apartments or whatever you're able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| It just allows for a little bit more review and quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| And you can't just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| there's a lot of poor quality stuff out there, Ms. Webb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| and we're just trying to protect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| Sir, we've been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| We know where the poor quality is, I assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Well, I'm sure your intentions are good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| but we don't know what will happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| And this is just one step of protection, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| But is this something that typically other people in R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| have to deal with, what you're wanting to put on us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| Is this something that is unusual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| Is this something that's widespread throughout the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| I'm real concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| And no, sir, I really don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Yes, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| In conferring with Ms. Mann and Ms. Case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| and saving the whole project from going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| they were going to suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| and I think asked me to suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| that you pass the general rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| on all but the seven properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| So they don't have to keep coming back to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| And pull the seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| six that MPC pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| and if you're inclined to pull the seventh one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| send those back and let MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| just consider those seven properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Well, just this afternoon, there was, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| this question about medium density residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| that might be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| I wanted to make sure that that was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| And maybe Mr. Donaldson can help clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| but I know that there are certain MDRs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| that are potentially impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| If, let's say, a fire burns one down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| they can't rebuild under this rezoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| I just want to make sure they are also protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| but I feel like we have to send this back to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| And maybe, Mark, you can clarify, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Yes, I found out this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| that there are some parcels in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| that have the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| In which case, rezoning them to R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| without changing the plan would be inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| So there are select, it's a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| but we do have to go and reexamine all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| And several of them already have apartments built on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| So we may want to keep those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| But I know of at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| probably eight that have houses on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| have a medium density residential land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| And by the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| any rezoning has to be consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| So we would have to change the plan on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| or back off on the zoning and keep the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| I'm happy to go forward with the seven properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| exempted, identified, and then exempted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| and pass this right now on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| if that's the will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| I just want to make sure we're not out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| if you will, going forward with those other handful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| of MDRs that you recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7306)|
| 2:01:53| Well, let's hear from Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| and then we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| I'll go back to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| I mean, Mark, is that, you know, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| One, do you have a full list of exempted properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| I mean, are there other ones you think should be exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| now that you've seen that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| There are others that probably should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| And I don't have all of those addresses now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| I have them circled on a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| But I can't be any more specific than that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| We did this recently on Sutherland Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| as I remember, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Did we make, were there any exemptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| or anybody asked to be pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| I don't remember any being pulled out of Sutherland Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| As I recall, we had one property owner that spoke up and, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7363)|
| 2:02:53| absentee property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| But we did, ultimately, we rezoned the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| But there wasn't the opposition that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| and identified properties that we have before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| I'd be in favor of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| One, either take, postpone it and give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| time to identify all the exempt properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| I'm OK to send it back to the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| But I'm hesitant at this point to put more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| put restrictions on these people that asked to be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| And I'm in favor of giving them the exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| and letting them go forward for the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| to collect how many ever, I think you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| 20, I'd say 1,600 properties or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| Let me call on Councilor Frans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7423)|
| 2:03:43| As Mr. Donaldson alluded to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| council can't rezone something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| would be out of compliance with the different one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| plans or the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| So I'd respectfully submit that if the R1 or R1A rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| for those medium density properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| that probably should not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| I respectfully submit, Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| can feel free to agree or disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| that maybe it needs to be looked at not addressing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| if that change in zoning would put them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| of sorts with the one year plan or the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| Mark, here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| And I guess it goes sort of in line with George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| But first of all, let me say about Sutherland Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| the one thing the neighborhood did there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| is they had over 65% of the people in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| And it was a much smaller area than what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| But Vice Mayor, is it possible that we just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| and it's obvious the neighborhood would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| like to have this passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| Can we just go back to the original request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| which is to approve on first reading the down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| with these seven properties exempt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| And just leave out the reviews on reviews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| Yes, leave that out and leave it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| so that the individuals here who want to be exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| or are exempted, there's no conditions put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| And we can move forward for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| in order to get their neighborhood down zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Now, how does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| That just completely leaves out the MDR properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| And that can be those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| But those will be affected, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| As part of this rezoning plan, those medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| properties are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| Yes, you are making council subject to a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| on the rezoning that could be inconsistent with both the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| Let me add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| I just briefly conferred with Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| that maybe if this passes like Councilman Grieve suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| that on second reading you might very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| have to come back and take out the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| residential, lest you get contrary to the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| and one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| I knew this would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| I mean, for some reason, this has gotten awful complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| So, but I mean, if we can, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| to look to the two council people in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| if we can go ahead and ask what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| I'm happy to go forward as submitted to us from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| and what was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| I'm just afraid that there are some properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| was just brought to my attention today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| that potentially we've affected in the future if, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| if there's a apartment complex that burns down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| and they can't go back and build because they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| they will be out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| They'll be not zoned properly at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| So are there that many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| There's just a handful of properties, like maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| I don't know, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| More than five, but less than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| We'd add those in on the second reading, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| And then by the second reading, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| can have an analysis of all of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| and see where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7643)|
| 2:07:23| End it on the second reading, and then you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| I'm going to move that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| and pass it the way it was originally set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| No, well, there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| Can we come back Thursday and revisit this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| You can withdraw your motion and make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| to postpone it until Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| OK, I would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| I'm going to withdraw and postpone it until Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| How many seconds can we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| Thursday the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| That'll give you plenty of time, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| Can we make sure that these individuals understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| Well, I don't know that we can do that because I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| the council understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| But I mean, these people are the ones that are being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| Yeah, I feel very understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| And I hope, yes, we can make sure all the information is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| clear and we answer all their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| So you withdrew your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| And the new motion is to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| until December the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| And I had like three seconds on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| OK, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Yeah, there's three seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| OK, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| I knew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| Got nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Does that leave us here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| Does that leave us then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7727)|
| 2:08:47| Come down to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| Ms. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| Does that leave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| Is it just in limbo until the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| Nothing's changed right now, Ms. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| We're just going to basically make it very clear for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| and bring this back with all the details therein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| And that way we're legal and everything's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| And again, we're not rezoning your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| That's not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Well, I just want to be sure we're understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| as property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| I would just recommend that you be back here on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7759)|
| 2:09:19| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| But I know at one of the meetings that we attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| it was brought up by somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| If a property burns, what can I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| That's been brought up and discussed prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| So we've heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| But we will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Well, there was an ordinance to rezone property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| on the southwest side of North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| southeast side of West Churchwell Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| from C3 slash IH1 to C6 slash IH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| Star Sales Company of Knoxville, Inc., the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| is 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| I'm going to make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| But I wanted to hear from Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| just for a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| I think there was something related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| to one of the parcel numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| Yes, on the application to change the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7801)|
| 2:10:08| the map was drawn to include two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| But the application was filled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131210?start=7813)|
