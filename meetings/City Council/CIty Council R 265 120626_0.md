| 0:05:16| announce July 11th we're going to have a public forum that'll be at the KCDC headquarters at four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| o'clock on July 11th and I want to make sure that the public is aware of that and then also mayor I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| just want to bring up something then not asking for a voter resolution or anything but the national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| night out is on October 2nd which is our council meeting and I just wanted to throw out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| council whether or not they might be interested I have talked to Vice Mayor Pavlis about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| whether or not we might want to move council to that Monday night October 1 since that is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| second and I would like the chief though to say a few words about the night out because this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| not just Knoxville this is the whole state of Tennessee so it is an important evening it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| an opportunity for us council members to get around to our neighborhood groups on that night so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| the chief could say a few words yes obviously if you've been to them before typically it is so hot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=372)|
| 0:06:20| particularly some of the folks that are interested in attending have issues being there on it and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| always been an issue particularly in southern states so the state of Tennessee through the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| Association of Chiefs of Police petitioned the national organization to move the date for our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| several other southern states have done the same thing and they will also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| recognizing national night out at the same time the state of Tennessee does so it is an effort to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| more accessible and enjoyable for the members of the public and the public servants that attend and assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| I've been to those August meetings they are national night outs they are hot so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| So anyway I just wanted to throw that out in terms of if any of the other council members have any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| they'd like to make about it or but what I thought I'd do is do a resolution if that doesn't seem to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| but I'm not asking for a vote or anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| I'm not real I understand that that is the night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| I would encourage us perhaps to start the meeting maybe thirty minutes or an hour later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| We've already moved one council meeting in December because it fell on Christmas and now we're moving another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| I'd hate for us to get into a habit of moving meetings around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| So I would as an alternative perhaps we could start at eight and maybe not a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| There are three meetings in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| By the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Correct Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Then in that case perhaps go with the other two meetings if there already are three scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| What time most of the neighborhood nights start about four or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| I know there's different starting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Some of mine start at six, six thirty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| You know, it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Now on National Night Out it may be a different time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| It does vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| It's up to the neighborhood group and what they choose to do, how they choose to honor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| It could be anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| We have them start anywhere from four thirty to five on it, as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| Sometimes six, six thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| A factor since it is moved that may make some of them be earlier is because obviously it will be darker earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=526)|
| 0:08:57| Well, perhaps Vice Mayor Pavlis can decide how he wants to work with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| I'm fine with whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Perhaps he'll get with Ms. Mitchell and she can poll you all for the different ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| and maybe just report back to us what you'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| We will have to have the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I wanted to bring it up early enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| No, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I think it's good to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=557)|

| 0:12:20| We were tasked to allow a restaurant to go in the building on the first floor with outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| seating and accordingly filed a use on review amendment with the Knoxville Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| The Planning Commission moved to deny the amendment but then offered an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| that we build a five foot sidewalk outside the existing sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| It's sort of hard to visualize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| In words, I have tried to do my best by the packets I have submitted to you all which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| show what is out there and try to portray to you the damage that would be done if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| had to put an additional sidewalk out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| The outdoor seating, because of city ordinances and building codes, would require a rail around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| it with gates at either end but these would be handicapped accessible gates and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| Pedestrians could still use the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| This sidewalk, for you all who have been there and I think portrayed in the pictures, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| really a sidewalk to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| It runs along the front of North Shore Drive and just terminates basically at the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| end of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| There is a neighborhood and a liquor store and then a neighborhood beyond this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| What we are asking to do is to overrule the action of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| and allow us to have the outdoor seating for the restaurant which is nearing completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| I think it may have a certificate of occupancy already and not build a sidewalk at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| The sidewalk as a practical matter or build the additional sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Sidewalk is not used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| There have been no pedestrians spotted on it in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| The parking for this building is to the north of the building and the tenants use the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| lot side to the north of the building for entrance into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| Although there are entrances that appear along North Shore and so forth as a practical matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| those are not used because the offices are medical offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| That, in essence, is what we are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Mr. Sullivan has some photographs I passed out to some people before the meeting showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| that if we had to build the additional sidewalk, in addition to the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| we would have to build a retaining wall which would take up even more space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| basically eliminate the landscaping, tree, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| and would really not be aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Whereas we think the situation, Parker-Knoxville did not build the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| but it was a nice building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It's got a nice design, and the sidewalk around it is basically decorative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| or at least the part on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| And this restaurant intends to put that to very good use for patio seating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| or outside seating at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| That, in essence, is our request that you overrule, respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| the action of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| and allow this amendment to the previously approved use-on-review for the property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| which is under development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Mr. Sullivan, do you want to add anything to what I have just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| State your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| We can get everybody out of the way, I think, in maybe just a couple of minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| if that's all right, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Your five minutes are up, and now we'll start another five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Ben Sullivan, 5720 Woodburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| I'm just here to take questions because it is maybe hard to gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| what we're trying to do based on the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| So if there are any questions, I can be of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I'm more than willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| The one point I wanted to make was we're really talking about access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| to potentially one space in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| which their front door is located directly off the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Theoretically, if someone were to be wanting to pass through the patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| they would be going around the building to get to the front door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| as opposed to going in the most direct route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| which is directly from the parking lot to the front door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| of that furthest west side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| That's the main point in the matter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| I wanted to ask Mark Donaldson about the MPC action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| I noticed that it was 13 to nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| which in and of itself is somewhat unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| And shockingly, I heard some of the commission members saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| we can't just look at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| We want to look 20 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| The idea of a town complex like this is to have a town center complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| is to have it pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| And taking away the sidewalk seems to make it un-pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Mark, would you please give us a little bit more background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Because that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I guess no one's using the sidewalk right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| and that's the point the applicants made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| But you were taking the long view, at least before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| So what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Yeah, I would add to that statement that no one is using the sidewalk yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| And certainly there is the hope that when fully developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| this area will turn into what the description of the town center district provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| And I'll just read the first sentence of the general description of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| The purpose of the town center district is to encourage the creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| of pedestrian-oriented mixed-use urban developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| My regret in this case is that we didn't make them build a public sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| in the public right-of-way when this building was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| And we could have avoided this by insisting that a sidewalk be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| in conjunction with the street improvements at that – along that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| But the premise of the district is to create –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| You mean out at the edge of the road, a sidewalk out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| So within the public right-of-way, between the curb and the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| imagine the sidewalk on Gay Street and the width of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| And it is wide enough to accommodate outdoor seating plus pedestrian through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| And we don't have that with the existing sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| It would be gated off, literally, from any future pedestrian traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| that we want to get from one part of the development along North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| to another part of the development within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| We were handed some photographs of why that seemed impractical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| to put a sidewalk outboard of the fence, sort of outboard of the existing sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| which they want to make a patio and make it a part of their restaurant business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| Is there any other location that a sidewalk would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| or is that where you would put it if you had to have a sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| I appreciate the photos, and to me they demonstrate that there's ample opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| to build a real pedestrian-oriented sidewalk outside of their proposed outdoor seating area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| There would have to be some retaining wall to bring the level of the sidewalk up to the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| but they are desiring to create a barrier there anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| in order to provide the food service within their outdoor seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| Do you understand that the food service is not required to be outdoors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| It's just an option they want to exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| So the sidewalk could be there and be functional if there was no food service outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Yeah, I just want to go back to I guess what you're saying, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| is that the sidewalk now, it's on private property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| It's not on the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| And the restaurant and all these businesses, they all have an entrance off of what would be what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| Mr. Seymour referred to as the northwest side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| So their main entrance where they're actually their sign, they have a sign on the back of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| and this is a use off the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| I mean, there's no parking at this front door, at any of those front doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| It's all in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| So I guess that was my other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| It seems to me that the two most effective people would be the two tenants that have yet to be leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| Do you have tenants for those, Mr. Seymour, Mr. Sullivan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Do you have tenants for the west, the next going west of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| The space west of the restaurant and the area that we're discussing is an allergist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| We just sold the unit as a condo, and so it will be an allergy practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| So it's taken in the furthest west is the one on the corner, back northwest corner, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Is that one also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| So, I mean, you sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| They'd be the one that would be kind of mostly affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| I mean, it's very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Did it take a use on review because it's a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Or just for this outdoor seating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| The terminology of use on review is a little suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| Within the town center zone district, all development is required to get a development plan approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1343)|
| 0:22:32| So it's a development plan that's being approved rather than a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| Honestly, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| I thought it was very shocking, like Councilman Della Vopi said, that it passed 12 to 0 or whatever, 12 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| I was very surprised by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I really didn't see any objection to it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Mark, one thing that you said about the sidewalks, which I agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| if you go up to where the road between this complex and the liquor store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| there are sidewalks that are actually on the circumference there of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| And like you say, that there is enough room in the right-of-way in the future to be able to put a sidewalk down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| if you take a look at what the pictures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| A couple of things that concern me about this is the fact that we are going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| if they are required to put a sidewalk in there, we're talking about not only a five-foot sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| but we're also talking about probably an additional 18 inches in order to put a foundation for a retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| that has to go around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| And the pictures that we were handed today show, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| the potential damage to the trees that are along Thunderhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| and then what happens with the planting area there on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| There's also utilities there in the corner that are close to the fence that might have to be relocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| once again, if you take a look at the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| And I think that a number of things which have already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| the spaces that, having been out there several times and looked at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| from the parking lot, most of the people are either going to enter into their spaces from the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| or they do have the lobby that goes through the building at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| And I think that with the future buildings that they're going to add down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| they're going to continue a sidewalk through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| But I do think that the other thing that they have made clear is that even with the table setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| that if somebody does want to walk through that area, it's not going to be locked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| In other words, it will be accessible down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| And I think that adding more concrete and adding and taking out the green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| is going to be real detrimental to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| And I think that at the same time, as far as the pedestrian walkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| I think that in the future, just like what you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| that maybe we should require that there be a sidewalk going down North Shore and connecting into that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| So I feel that I'm certainly going to be in favor of approving this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| I, too, went to look at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| and I was concerned that that is not a very wide sidewalk to have tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| servers, and pedestrians perhaps moving one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| There is one person I do know who uses that sidewalk almost every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| and so there is pedestrian traffic on that sidewalk from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| I always think that we need to look to the councilman or councilwoman whose district is impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| by whatever is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| So I will be following Councilman Grieve's lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| but I do have reservations about this use of the sidewalk for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| Patio dining is great, but I would have been much more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| if this had been considered sooner than later in the design, the planning, and the construction of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| I'm sure that this will meet any fire code regulations to have this patio dining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| and so I will be looking to Councilman Grieve for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Yes, I wanted to know, how many people, if you have the outdoor seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| how many people can you seat there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| May I check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| I think it's about ten tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| Forty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Forty people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| And how many inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| A hundred anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| I was just in the space before it was finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| It's 2,700 square feet interior space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And on the issue that's been brought up about sidewalks in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| the sidewalks that will go up Thunderhead are going to be wide enough to have patio seating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| if anybody wants it, plus pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I guess I'm still concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| I've heard comments of my colleagues, but, you know, this is a self-made problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| They move into a town center zone that says that it's to be pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| There's a sidewalk built as part of the building, and then they decide they really want something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and they want to convert the sidewalk to their personal patio and exclude the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| You can open the gate and walk through and step over the waiter and go around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| and dodge the dog if they allow dogs in their dining area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| This is a self-made problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Why should the zone, whose purpose is to make it pedestrian and people friendly to move through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| why does it have to suffer because they've changed their mind knowing they went into a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| that was supposed to have sidewalks and pedestrian access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| If there's room along North Shore or some other place to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| why don't they build a substitute sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Why do they kill the plan in order to get an economic advantage when they went in there with their eyes open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| knowing that this was intended to have this pedestrian access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| I'm opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| I had a question for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Because this whole issue arises out of the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| and you often apply for your clients to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Did you consider that in this instance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Councilman Stair, we discussed that with our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Some people suggested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| He likes the town center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| He likes the idea of what it is trying to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| And he declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| He did ask through Mr. Sullivan and me to talk to MPC about some amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| that would help him further develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| And MPC passed those and recommended them to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| And you all passed them, I think, a month ago that allows office space on the first floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| and increases the size of buildings permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| But he likes the town center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| He said he's never done a development in it, but after looking at it with a few minor tweaks, he really likes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Can you tell us a little bit about the history of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| It seems like it was put up a while ago and has been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Why has that been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| It went through a foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Our client bought part of the note out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| And the other part went through the same process where the target in publics is, Mr. Collins' property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| went through a foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| This is a new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| He did not build the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Had he built the building, he perhaps would have done it a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| But he has had very good success with finishing up leasing the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| I don't think there was anybody in that when you all acquired it, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| He's leased it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| He is in the process of designing two new buildings as you go up Thunderhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| where he will have the very wide sidewalks along there and is very pleased with the progress he is making here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1833)|
| 0:30:43| But it was vacant for a number of years, I think probably five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| You know, my greatest concern is, you know, just trying to make sure this place is healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| I think right now what we have is just a sidewalk that's probably not used hardly at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| They want to at least use it for a restaurant, and, you know, I think we should allow them to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| and a few pedestrians will be able to walk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Mark, wasn't it one time this whole area, including where Target and Publix is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| wasn't that all originally planned to be a town center, all that property through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| What was the history kind of of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Within the last two years, we have broken out the area that contains the Target and Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| from its former zoning of town center to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| In doing that, we included as conditions a lot of the design principles from the town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| so that there is a clear tie between the planned commercial zone and the town center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1907)|
| 0:31:56| This particular parcel was added to the town center after the original one was approved to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1916)|
| 0:32:06| So it's always had a different ownership than the larger piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| But my point is that we've made a lot of different types of changes out there in order to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| in order to accommodate the businesses that have been out there, I mean, with Target and Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| and that sort of thing, from what it was originally a number of years ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| The shift from the town center zone to the planned commercial zone acknowledged its proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| to Interstate 140 and its intersection with North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| and the fact that the property had been vacant for a long time and needed some sort of a kick start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1957)|
| 0:32:47| But between that area and this building is the lake, which will become the heart of the proposed town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1967)|
| 0:32:56| as the current owners are envisioning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I might ask Mr. Hagerman, is there any plans for sidewalks along North Shore out at that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| I know that there's none there right now, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| There are no plans, but there's also no problem from an engineering perspective with adding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| But there's no plans to fund them out of city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Your motion is to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| And allow the use of the outdoor seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2026)|

| 0:35:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| I guess Mr. Hagerman is here and so is Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| As I understand it, there's been a change by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| They want to build a substation and sort of solve one of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| of getting the power poles off of Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| and moving them back, coming a different route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| And that's one of the things that's happening here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| That's essentially correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| We've designed the electrical three times on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| We first had them overhead in the alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Then we had them underground running the length of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| But because of the new substation that KUB has built at 17th and Dale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| they do not have to make that linear run down Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| They just have to cross it at two locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| So that's going to save us probably a million and a half dollars in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| but it's taking a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of design to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| We're going to take another stab at the design to accommodate this additional change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| but the plus is we don't have to underground it along Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| In the end, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| But, once again, a lot of this electrical work has already been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| and we're projecting ahead and saying this is how far it's put us behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| But we'll get there at the end with where we intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| One of the things that you talk about in this plan is a traffic light on that hill going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Is that 17th or Clinch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| 17th and Clinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Some folks are not real happy about the idea of trying to stop halfway up the hill in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| Maybe Mr. Hagerman can talk about the safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Just a little thing for that, and then I'll turn it over to Jim to mention just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| When we got into this project, obviously we discussed from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| that there would be diversions of traffic from Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| because the capacity would not be increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| In fact, it would be decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| There's figured there will be more traffic on Clinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Clinch is already an intersection that has a high side impact ratio of crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| So we thought that this would, because it's a three-way stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| that we asked the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| They felt like this was the best way to deal with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| This was in part to help solve the crash issue that you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| That's correct, because it's a very confusing intersection right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| It's the only one where three people stop and one has to go all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| And we feel like we can manage that through a traffic signalization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| And one of the things that's going to happen is because Cumberland is going to restrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| some of the left turns as people will be going around the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| going to a main intersection, going around the block and doubling back to a start point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| There will be more of the looping type traffic we anticipate, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I'll make another comment about the light at 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| The safety thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| There's also a light that's going to be added at White, and that should break up traffic enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| The idea is to synchronize those lights to minimize the number of cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| that actually have to stop at Clinch on the steep section of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| So through the magic of electronics, you're going to sort of stage the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| approaching that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| We call it platooning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2319)|

| 0:40:06| Yeah, I wonder if we have either Jim York or perhaps Ms. McGinnis, but we have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| CAT and Citi insurance issues coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| Does the Citi actually be the one that will purchase the insurance or are we just approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| this on behalf of CAT and as part of your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I know that you've gone through the Willis Company and tried to get good prices and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| that, and obviously we need insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Could you just give us a little bit of the information about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I'm Cindy McGinnis with CAT 301 Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| The City of Knoxville does all purchasing on behalf of CAT other than payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| We have a separate pay account for payroll, so this is consistent with all Citi purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| And the Citi purchases the insurance in the name of Catrans Management, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| But we're spending your budget in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| I realize we contribute to that, but we're spending your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Is that where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| It comes from the CAT budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2466)|

| 0:41:41| and General Insurance Company to provide excess workers' compensation insurance coverage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| the City of Knoxville for an annual premium not to exceed $190,685 and to execute a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| consistent with the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2515)|

| 0:41:57| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| I'm sure Jim is here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Anyway, I'm looking at this and two things strike me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| One is that this premium is much lower than the CAT premium for workers' comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| It appears that we retain some of the liability in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Is that why there's a difference in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| And before Ms. McGinnis leaves the room, maybe she could tell us why she has a high workers'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| comp number in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| No, what you said is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| I'm Gary Eastis, the City's Risk and Benefits Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| Please speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Gary Eastis, the City's Risk and Benefits Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| What you said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| The City is self-insured and has a high deductible or high retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| So it's only that overage we're insuring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| And do you know why or can Ms. McGinnis tell us why they're having, what, a higher premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| in terms of workers' comp experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Obviously, they don't have a retained amount, but what is the cause of all the workers' comp claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| and is there anything we're doing to reduce that in your risk department or in their offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| She would need to speak to their claims, but there's a, the reason their premium is higher, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| in general is because the insurance pays the first dollar of their claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| and does not pay the first dollar of our claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| You pay the, they pay over $2 million on your claims, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| You retain the first $2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| We retain the first $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| So our premium is much lower because there's companies taking much less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Ms. McGinnis, I apologize, but if you would indulge us for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| are you doing anything to reduce your workers' comp costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| I mean, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Safety is key with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| And, of course, we don't want our employees to be any more exposed to hazardous situations than possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| We had safety meetings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| We have monthly safety meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| You can't walk into a room at CAT and not see safety posters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| We're really a very safe property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| It's just the first dollar coverage is much more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| And bus operator and bus mechanic classifications are not considered low-risk occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| They're working on heavy equipment, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2660)|

| 0:48:22| Hi, I'm Angela Halber with the City of Knoxville Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| I'm here because this is actually an ordinance that a lot of people from a lot of different departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| led by the Office of Business Support, has brought together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| And pedicab, you're right, I think it would be cool if you could get a pedicure on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| If you hit a bump, you could ruin your cuticles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I know that would be rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| But it is a three-wheeled bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| It's not motorized, and it would seat up to four passengers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| And it depends on the weight of the passengers typically, but up to three adults generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| or two adults and two children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Would they be on the city street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| They would be on a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| And the idea is currently we have an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| The pedicab business, if you wanted to do that without this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| it would fall under the vehicles for hire ordinance, which is usually for taxi cabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| The regulations there don't really fit pedicabs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| and so the Office of Business Support kind of led an effort to see what regulations would be specific for a pedicab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| And we looked at some other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Danielle Goins, our law clerk in our office, looked at some different cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| and we brought several ideas to the table and discussed what city staff could support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| And this is what we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Well, it's an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| I didn't know if there was much demand, or did you do some kind of survey to decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| The city has received several inquiries over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| and I think in 2008 the state of Tennessee passed some enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| that would specifically allow this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| I wonder if the officer could tell us if you anticipate any traffic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| with slow-moving bicycles and fast-moving cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Is that a concern at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Yes, sir, it is, and that was part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| We were part of this group that assisted in creating this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| and part of the ordinance is that the routes will be reviewed by the police department and subject to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3028)|
| 0:50:38| And there are some proposed routes there that are part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| that have been discussed with the folks interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| I think there will be some interesting left-hand turns and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| So you're going to work with them to get routes that minimize the kind of traffic interference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Obviously the concern is the pedestrian-bicycle-vehicle conflict potential for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| And that's what we look at is we're looking at potential routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| You said that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I wanted to say make love, not war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| It sounded like the 60s or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Would the routes be primarily downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| At this point, the idea is that they would be primarily downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Certainly that's going to aid in our tourism, and I would definitely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| What do we presently have for horse-drawn carriages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Is there an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| There is an ordinance that covers horse-drawn carriages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Is it similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| And the reason it's not similar is because it is more concerned with the health of the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| So we're not concerned about the person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Well, I think it was drafted in 1962, so I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| I was not here for that, but it was primarily concerned about making sure that the animals are cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| And it leaves everything else up to the police department, pretty much, the route approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| and what types of equipment and such are required for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| So, I mean, it's similar as far as the routes go, Chief, as far as horse-drawn carriages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| I probably also advise animal control, so I've worked on the horse-drawn carriages probably a little more in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| But the routes for horse-drawn carriages are very, very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| and they're kind of subject to, instead of having a master plan that's already approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| because the carriages are more for tours or special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| So as part of their application, they submit where they'd like to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| and then that gets approved by the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I do want to recognize that Patricia Robledo is here from our Office of Business Support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| That was mentioned several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| This is an example of how there was a business that had a new idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| went to the Office of Business Support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| and Patricia was able to walk this business owner through talking to the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| So I want to commend Patricia and all the departments that worked together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Twelve fees and ordinance appropriating the sum of $12,852 from the Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| and Recreation Department's Grants and Benevolence Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| and donating same for completed projects to various qualified groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| as part of the Challenge Grant Award Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Yeah, as long as Joe is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Joe, these are great projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Would you tell us a bit about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Is this an ongoing program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| In other words, will there be Challenge Grant Awards next year, and what's involved in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| There will be, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| The Challenge Grant Program has been around probably since about 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| It's something that we've been funded every year in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| It's really worthwhile projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| We take applications starting August 1st through the end of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| and then we grant up to $2,500, 50-50 matching grants to worthwhile community activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| that fall within public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| We work with PTAs, neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| We've worked with the Tennessee Isaac Walton League, Beardsley Farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| various and sundry neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| The reason I ask that is if I want to advise neighborhoods to look into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| where do they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| To your website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Do they call your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| They go to the city website, Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| You can get a copy of the form online and complete it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| and send it to our offices by September 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| And they do that between the beginning of August and the middle of September, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Correct, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| And then we will award that within four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| and they have until about May 30th to complete their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| We'll go out and inspect the project, make sure they have the necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Are you paying arrears after you inspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| We reimburse them up to 50% of the cost of their project once it's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| No one has signed up for public forum, so there being no further up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Sorry, guys, I almost said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Jim, I apologize for not getting in touch with you later or earlier today on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| But one of the questions that I have maybe both to you and, Mayor, maybe to the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| one of the things that came up or I was thinking about, especially on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| where we approved this change order, is there in any of the contracts we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| is there any limit to the amount of a change before you have to go back out for bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| In other words, this was a contract that was for about $1.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| and then we added over $500,000 to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Or I guess, Mr. York, is there any kind of rules or regulations that if the scope of the project changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| or there's such a change order of a certain size that you do negotiate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120626?start=3370)|
