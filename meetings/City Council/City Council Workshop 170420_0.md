| 0:17:18| didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| director of redevelopment, Rick Emmett, our downtown coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| Chris Howley for engineering, we needed that to make sure that this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| worked with the streets, etc. And then we had Janice McClellan from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| purchasing to make sure that we stayed right on track with the way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| handled this and did not veer away from the appropriate procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| So we selected them because going down the list, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| the scores were higher in all of these major components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Both, a number of the, I would say three of the four were consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| the stated mixed use vision, so that was fairly consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Financial and business plan. Dover development had a significantly larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| investment and eventual impact on the tax base with an $83 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| That was the key highest score item there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| A strong investment partner with Bristol, and you will hear from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| later with who's done a lot of very high quality residential work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| different cities around the region and further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| There was a tighter timeline, excuse me, explicit timeline with an explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| beginning date and 3.1 years rather than 4.1 for the second place finisher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| which is also a very, you know, it had a lot going for it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| There was a lot to like about the second place, Mr. Kazana's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| complex as well, but we thought this scored higher, everybody felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| consistent that it consistently scored higher on all of these elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Really the most important though, getting to what we want to avoid as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| pitfall was we had committed partners and letters of intent by Aloft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| Light Lodging and Aloft, a very strong hotel, a very strong hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| We had Randy Burleson Restaurant, PetSafe, so everybody, we had all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| components accounted for with letters so that this would not just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| speculative along with a much tighter timeline and that was, I can't stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| enough how important that was. We asked each of the teams, the three we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| came in, do you have letters of intent? And they were the only one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| had anything like this letter of intent. Well, another higher scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| item was historic resources, that was part of the review criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| We included the possibility of using some of the elements if the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| wasn't going to do the courtroom, but it was clear that saving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| courtroom would score much higher on the elements and we much preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| that. So on the historic resources, there was a definite advantage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| Dover development over the other proposals which took the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| courtroom down, but that was important. Sustainability, there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| commitment in the proposal to use the green building code, the first to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| so, and that was stronger than building to lead standards which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| had in one of the other, in the other major proposal. So that's why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| were selected. So where we are now is we had what we think was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1238)|
| 0:20:46| not only a sound process, but really the best practices being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| implemented in this process that we could do, again, for disposal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| public assets. And we explicitly, of course, put in a no contact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| anybody, and nobody violated this by the way, a no contact provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| among the proposers until this purchase and sale agreement was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| public. So, and unless my team thinks I've missed something important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| here, I wanted to go as quickly as possible. I think what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| is we could have either, I'll leave this up to the pleasure of Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Mayor Grieve or any on council, if you want to have any questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| this now or wait and get through the whole thing and hear from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Dover and then open it up for general Q&A, so I'll defer to you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| What's the pleasure of council? Do you have questions now? Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| That's why I look this way first. That's why you're excited. I just want to ask you if y'all handed out the copy of the real property purchase and sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| agreement, which I was just skimming. I'm sort of surprised the earnest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| money sounds a little light, doesn't it? I mean, usually it's 10% or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| something of the deal. Why $10,000? It seems like a pittance to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| Well, I think we've had people, do you want to address that, Jordana or Mark? I mean, we have people on our negotiating from our, we have great attorneys working with us who we relied on to stay pretty much to the standard real estate transaction approach. But I will say that all along this, and we're getting into the purchase and sale agreement specifics, you may want to get into that or hold on to get any further than answering your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1327)|
| 0:22:32| Which is, this was about, one of the things I've heard is why this takes so long? There's a tension. The tension is we're trying to get a commitment from the developer that says we got to hold you to a timeline and if you don't stick to it, we have to be a way to draw this back, to get this property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1352)|
| 0:22:51| We obviously can't convey the deed of the property to anybody without any kind of callback provision or any other process and not have control over what happens. So we're on that tightrope between, can we ensure that we have the ability to get it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1371)|
| 0:23:06| Now, putting on the hat of the developer, they're on, from their point of view, they're trying to say how much money would we might spend on this along the way, developing plans, hiring architecture, doing all the work that we would do, risking the cities pulling this back. What if something happens beyond our control and we go a month over? Are you going to take property back? And that's why all those timelines are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1386)|
| 0:23:30| Now, as for the earnest money, I think that all gets into, I'll defer. Mark, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| Mark Mamontoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee. In a commercial purchase agreement like this, you rarely see meaningful earnest money up front. In fact, $10,000 is actually a little...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1418)|
| 0:23:50| Or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Well, even on residential contracts, particularly on commercial contracts because of the due diligence needed, almost, if there's anything unique about this contract as to the initial phase, you often will see a 90-day due diligence period instead of 120, but other than that, it's very standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1431)|
| 0:24:05| You will normally see, basically, a small refundable deposit up front while the prospective purchaser does thorough due diligence on the property, usually environmental work, surveys, title work, and then at that point, it'll go hard at the end of the due diligence period, which is what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1445)|
| 0:24:24| Because we have to hopefully incorporate design elements that the city will want, particularly as they relate to parking, we have a second period, which we call the schematic design period, which another $10,000 will be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1464)|
| 0:24:38| Four months for the due diligence kind of groundwork around, then another four months for the design kind of discussion, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| And they'll spend quite a bit of money in the first four months, but they'll spend a lot of money the second four months on design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| And so the $10,000, yes, in the scheme of things, it's not a ton of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Their real money that they're going to be seeing is in the cost that they're going to be spending, and they have no reimbursement rights against us if, for some reason, things don't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1495)|
| 0:25:05| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I just looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| When I first started doing this, I thought it was pretty de minimis, too, but it's sort of really the common way in a commercial transaction like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Bill, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| You and I have talked about this a little bit before, but in the rankings that you looked at, in the criteria that you looked at, where was aesthetics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| How did that fall into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Yes, I might add, we were all concerned about this being a signature building for that site in appearance and the way it sits on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1532)|
| 0:25:42| We really couldn't put that in as a review criteria for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| One, nobody is going to spend enough money to design an entire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| You being an architect know this at this stage, so we're talking about basically conceptual sketches and designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| I had my own preferences of which sketch and design I liked better, but it was nowhere in the review criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| I don't know how one could, it being so subjective and at such an early stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Now, we've made clear in our discussions, I think even during that time, that as part of the development agreement, we wanted a very high standard of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1572)|
| 0:26:23| What we did consider was both teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| The top two teams, well, all the teams, the top two teams we're speaking to right now had great teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| McCarty-Holesapple is outstanding for the Kazana group, and Faris Eid has done wonderful work for a number of places, and he's part of the Dover team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1590)|
| 0:26:40| We felt confident that we had the expertise here to end up with a suitable design, but it would have been very difficult to operationalize it into a decision criteria matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1600)|
| 0:26:52| So, will that be determined during the development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| How will you control it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Well, we have two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I mean, obviously, we will want to see, when we come back later, we'll want to see what the building will look like, proposed to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| and much more investment by time by the architect in that, and then we also have to figure out ways to ensure that the building that's built is the same as the one that's drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1626)|
| 0:27:16| There's one or two examples we could all think of where that didn't quite happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| And speaking of lessons learned, that's a lesson learned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| So, at the time of the development agreement, you will have a design to look at that will be a real design based around actual structural engineering concerns, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1644)|
| 0:27:36| Who will oversee that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| I mean, as far as the city, will it be the same selection committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Oh, we're not bound by the selection committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| We've got, say, Christy Branscombe here has a lot of expertise in this whole field, and she'll obviously be working with us on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| We'll reach out to others, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| I mean, we are freed up, and really, the selection committee is no more, it has no magic as we move forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Though, obviously, the redevelopment and downtown folks are still concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| and we'll also be consulting engineering to make sure that exits for parking garages and so forth work with the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| We'll go back to the contract, since you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| I just want to understand the timeline of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Okay, so we have, we vote on it on Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| Upon successful voting, he has four months for the inspection period, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| So, at the end of that four months, if we survive that and he approves that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| then he has another additional four months for the design period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| With $10,000 earnest money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| And then closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Is that, is there something else in there, any way to extend that, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| No, actually, we spent an awful lot of time going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| We wanted a tighter timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| They wanted a broader timeline, because of the, you know, for obvious reasons, for the uncertainties that were built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| We wanted it to be built as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| They wanted to have, make sure they were something they could live with for contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| But that's, what you read is pretty much it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Okay, so we'd have a closing, all that goes successful, we'd have a closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| and the earnest money would go to $20,000 for the second four-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| So then we'd have closing, and then construction to begin within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And then, if it doesn't start within a year, then the property reverts back to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| The closing is four months after the design period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| So you've got three four-month periods, you've got a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Okay, so there's another four-month period in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Look at Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| Total of 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| 12 months, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| And if I understand it right, so, we're asked to vote on that as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| So that, we can't, we can't alter that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| That's either, if I understand it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| I guess we could bring it back for some reason and ask you to, could we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| Charles, I mean, if there was an agreement that we wanted to change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| we could all defer to our attorneys on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| I think we have the option of doing that with your consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Yeah, I mean, certainly you could amend it at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Was this certainly what we would have liked to have seen on your side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We'd have liked to have seen a shorter period, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| They wanted a longer period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| There are some great opportunities here for public infrastructure development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Particularly, possibly, some parking, public parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| to help support the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| That obviously is something that's going to take some time to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| if we're successful in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| So, we felt that given some time to try to help facilitate that as part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| that it merited longer than what otherwise would have been normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| for an agreement of this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Yes, we would have liked to have it shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I'm sure Mr. Dover, when he gets up here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| would probably tell you why he felt like it needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| I will also add, though, that we're looking at an apartment development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| and a hotel development, possibly subdividing the parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| possibly developing separate reversionary rights on the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| if they don't move ahead promptly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| This next to regal is probably the most complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| essentially, public-private partnership development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| And it's not a partnership in any sort of legal sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| which you understand, but the most complicated real estate development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| that you all have undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| So, it will take some time to document it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| So, even though parking wasn't a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Well, I don't know. Maybe it was. Maybe I missed it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| But parking, that wasn't a requirement in the RFP, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| to develop parking for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| You want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| It was a component under the financial and business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| And actually, the other proposer had more points on that element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| because there was the ability for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| to lease some parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| And that's one of the reasons that the scores were reasonably close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| That is, not having the parking accounted for right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| is something we need to continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| But it wasn't a separate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| We used it as something that was to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| And obviously, that's one of the things we need to keep working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| So, we've got a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| So, we've got a year to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| And then a year to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| And then it would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| If he doesn't build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Yeah. If he doesn't build it, then we'll have to try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| So, Bill, also then, there'll be five new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| when it comes a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| To close on this, right? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| I know we all want to hear Mr. Dover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| How did we look at the proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| of more office space versus more hotel or residential space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| In other words, that's a big tradeoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| between these two agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| How did you evaluate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| What was the thought process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Well, we were rather agnostic on one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| There could be outstanding uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I think it's clear that the element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| of benefiting the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| would lead to the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| There were some advantages to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| that are obvious as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| The big difference of how we considered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| frankly, was we had an investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| and a hotel group who stepped up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| who was ready to commit to doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| and we had nothing on the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| We had no tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We had no certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| They're saying likelihood to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Likelihood to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| was where the letters of intent factor came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| So that's pretty much a market cue right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| an investor ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| from an outstanding hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| versus more speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| As a city, we don't really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| the marketplace as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| as hopefully a developer might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And again, we would look at it a little differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| if it was going to be a city-owned office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| or a city-owned hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| but somebody's going to go at substantial risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| So that's why we obviously defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| to where the investors step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Yeah, I would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| either Ms. Bogart or Kim come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| What these additional rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| does for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| the tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| And what is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| You get two for one money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I didn't know, appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| who would speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| I thought we were both coming down here, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| It's okay, though. I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I'll go first, and she can chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Kim Bumpus, 301 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| You know, we're on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| real rise right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We came out with the strongest numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| that I've seen in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| in 2017 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| probably in forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Right now, we're trending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| year-to-date 8.8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| up in occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| 3.4% in average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| daily rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| We see the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| That is definitely different than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| forecast we had done about four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| that put us out till 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| We're outpacing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| We're also signing multiyear groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| left and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| right going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| 2020, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| From my perspective, just as I stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| when I spoke on behalf of the Tennessean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| we have capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| for more hotel rooms, and Aloft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| is a very valuable brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| That's how I see it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| we do have more groups coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| on the market right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| I think Mary can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| to this. We're at venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| capacity in ways that we've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| been at before. That's also why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| we're trying to get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| venue space. Therefore, you bring more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| groups and fill more hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| How many rooms do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| have downtown now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Roughly, it depends how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| look at it, whether it's group or total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| We're in that 2,200 to 2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| range, depending on what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| getting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| It's been a slow progression, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| it has been progression. Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| getting you into another level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| of conventioneers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| or whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Definitely. We're a different type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| market to sell. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| spoken on that before because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| a variety of products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| and we don't have that one signature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| hotel that's got 900 rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| in it. That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| We have found the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| actually is expanding to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| because people now, this whole outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| initiative, they like to get outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| They're okay with multiple properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| When you think about the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| center, and you think about going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| after bigger pieces of business, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| to have more sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| for group blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Just by the nature of the way we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| approved projects and hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| that have come online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| we have to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| expand what we can offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| within walking distance to the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2233)|

| 0:37:27| General manager of the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| One of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| that is very important to us and our marketability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| as a city is having connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Having walkable, connected hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| rooms to the facility is very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| important. The other thing that we're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| in the market are additional breakout rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| We actually don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| have enough meeting rooms at the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| to support some of the groups that are wanting to book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| our market. To have additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| breakout rooms and walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| very close proximity to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| convention center would be a huge benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Let's talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| about that. I'm not familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| the Loft brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Talk about that brand and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| is it considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| a limited service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| hotel and how that fits into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| the variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| that you already have downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| It's a Sheraton brand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| and you could argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| limited or extended based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| the project that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| as it relates to the letter of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| which I have not seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| With that said, a loft brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| a very cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| sense to the market share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| that we already have and we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| any product that's kind of like in a loft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I don't know if anyone stayed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| but it's a very different kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| of experience so I think it compliments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| what we already have. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| some traditional feeling properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| We have our first luxury brand, which is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| We also have a boutique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| with the Oliver. I think it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| with our mix well and I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| it speaks to a big brand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I believe I can come into the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| and I can make money and that helps us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| market as we push to new groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| So I'm sure Rick will get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| this what the daily rate of a loft is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| compared to what we already have so we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| save that for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| That should be for Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| On that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| to dovetail off that, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| you said the ADR is up but what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| With the way that our market lays out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| and I think I've gone through this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| we have roughly 90 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| 100 properties countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So when you look at it like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| countywide we typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| always hover in that 80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| to 88 dollar range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| but you have to look downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I was getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| I was just taking you along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| The whole 101 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| we're averaging 119| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| year to date and this is our slowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| We closed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| and I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| yeah, we were like at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| 122.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| We have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| growth availability end rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| but a lot of that comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| the way that the downtown properties market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| As Visit Knoxville, we're always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| trying to bring higher quality business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| and so is the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| so that we can drive rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| but at the end of the day we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| control the hotels so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| we encourage them to drive rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| we push them to drive rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| and they've got that accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| on football weekends but when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| comes to some of the group business I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| that we're bringing the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| where we will grow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| and that's why even when occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| which is still on a double digit increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| even when that starts to flatten out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| we still have great potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| to maintain these hotel motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| collection growths that we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| right now because we can drive rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| and we see them doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| now but that's just where the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| are right now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| I had a couple questions for Bill if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| alright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| sorry to interrupt you there Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| kind of curious and surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| the overall process did involve any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| of economic impact for the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| proposals and how that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| affect the city. What can you expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| on that or have any estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| the office space versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| residential and the hotel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Well you know again assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| that the office occurred I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| that's the big assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| we would have a hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| in terms of economic impact the first is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| initial investment which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| $50 some million to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| $50 something I believe for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| other one. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Then we had the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| we also would have hotel motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| added on to that and both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| would have retail and sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| now obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| an office building where somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| brings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Microsoft is going to have a phenomenal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| economic impact but I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| assumptions one could make without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| any assurance of tenants or who those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| tenants were. So basically we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| you're right we didn't have that general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| component considered but it was more in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| more indirect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| impact through the enhanced stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| of the convention center to appeal to larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| conventions and bring them in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| adding to the hotel inventories you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Ms. Bumpus explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| definitely works to that end the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| larger investment the hotel motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| tax all led us to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| economically we had a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| attractive option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| with the Dover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| proposal. Okay thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I was surprised to see in the agreement the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| allowable reduction in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| potential hotel rooms would drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| possibly from 160| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| to 90 rooms which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I guess over 40-45% or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| is that something that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| altered? I mean don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| we want to maximize the number of space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Well we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| it's an argument we have to see what really works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| for the operator and what they think they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| handle at this time we would have rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| had more rooms than fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| rooms but on the other hand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| is part of why we get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| the negotiation part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| once we reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| there was a lot of give and take in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| elements of this and that will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| so the answer is we think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| consistent enough with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| intent of the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| to be something we would work on but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| certainly we would prefer more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| than fewer yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I just have one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| so how long now has that building been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| vacant? Gosh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| was it the 90's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I guess it's when they transitioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| does anybody know offhand when that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| It's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| longer and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Steve I was involved in KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| or the city so it's back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| 20 plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Gord do you want to go back to the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| so I mean you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| that no LOIs were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| provided in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| in Kazana's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| proposal would you have expected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| receive an LOI on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| perspective tenant for several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| years out or were you expecting to get an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| LOI from a bank that says well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| what were you looking for I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| LOI is different on an office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| as opposed to a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| yeah thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I'm sorry to interrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| we were looking for a tenant or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| some indication remember this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| was three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| with no commitment and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| left before so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| we had an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| that a tenant would have been committed at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| one substantial tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I don't know what it would take to get a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| on an office building that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| my expertise but I do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| no matter what one builds especially you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| with condos you need X amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| commitments so without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| letters of intent would have been a spec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| office building basically at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| and I don't know that we had any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| we did not want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| have that degree of uncertainty moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| we would get a completed project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I would think three years out would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| a long time to expect that you'd get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| LOI on a tenant but that's just my thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| right thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Mr. Dover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2741)|

| 0:45:47| thank you Vice Mayor Grieve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| council for having us tonight I'm Rick Dover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| 4921 Hamburg Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| we're very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| to be here today this has been a long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| just to get before you and now a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| to kind of open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| up the box and show you what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| we're so excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I guess first of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| it's a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| investment we see this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| one of the last if not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| best remaining site downtown certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| one of the best remaining sites downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| we love its location we're committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Knoxville and committed to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| and committed to reactivating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| or totally activating this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| property as it never has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| before so our elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| are maintain and preserve and restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| the existing courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| and then activate the balance of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| through mixed use and that's a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| of retail, residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| hospitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| the way that we look at that is we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| the retail component is approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| 20,000 square feet we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| 230 apartment units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| proposed, 170 hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| rooms proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| nearly 500 parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| with an annual payroll of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| created of nearly 1.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| a year and that's nearly 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| permanent jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| in addition I would say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| 20,000 feet of retail space is spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| for so it will be very active from day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| one there won't be any dark spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| it's a total of just over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| half a million square feet of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| and a capital investment of over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| 82 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| but what I'm most about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| really excited about not only that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| the team that we have put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| I've looked at this property for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| followed the review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| when the art piece went out the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| for now we've put the components back together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| the way that it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| in so doing I looked around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| for who would be the dream team to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| this is kind of a legacy project for me by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I've been in this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| 39 years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| a Knoxvillian, Bearden High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| and UT graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| and I love our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| but I have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| where we are right now in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| is kind of a tipping point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| some people think that this market is overheated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| some people think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Knoxville is on its way and it has arrived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| I think we're on our way but I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| the fabric of what we're doing is very fragile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| so it was very important to me to put together the right team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| of players that could deliver high quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| and performance on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| side, on the operating side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| and on the design side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| so I'm thrilled to be working with our joint venture partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Bristol Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| from Franklin, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2907)|

| 0:49:33| in the design process but Randy has a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| exciting concept for a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=2975)|

| 0:51:47| location, this incredible site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| excited to be teamed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| with Rick and this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| talented team that we've assembled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| to do this but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| even more excited personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| to be back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3119)|

| 0:52:03| ago, we won't get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| exactly when that was, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| stayed and worked here for 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| years afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| most of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| with an office in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| and so I'm particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| pleased to see what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| happened, I've followed this transformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| of downtown which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| to your credit has become the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| envy of cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| that we work in, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| States, cities that are three and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| times the size of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| wish they had what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| going on in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| so I consider Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| still my spiritual home if not my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| physical home today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Bristol was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| formed in 1999| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| as Rick said, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| done 34| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| apartment communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| most of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| are complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| mixed use developments in urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| type locations like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| that's become a specialty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| of ours, those 34| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| communities add up to over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| a billion dollars of original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| cost, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| are in seven states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| and right now we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| five communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| that are either finishing construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| or one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| will start construction this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| week and another one next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| and those are in Richmond, Virginia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Chattanooga, the one we're finishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| is in Birmingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Louisville, Kentucky and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| actually two in Richmond so that makes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| the five, so our footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| geographically is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Mid-Atlantic, Southeastern United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| States primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| though we have ventured west of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Mississippi River to Texas and Arkansas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| on occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| so we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| one thing and that one thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| development, most often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| with a retail component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| in a mix of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| 8,700 apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3247)|

| 0:55:19| they rent because they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| they want to be in the kind of environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| that downtown Knoxville provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3323)|

| 0:55:31| residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3331)|

| 0:55:41| elements or common areas or amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| you might call them where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| gather, the amenities in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| well done communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| are no longer just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| pretty place you see on a leasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| tour, they're places that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| actually use and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| put a lot of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| into making that so because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| if we can do that right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| will gather in these spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| and knit themselves together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| in a community which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| good for them but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| it's also good for us because if they like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| that then they tend to stay longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| and not hop around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| and move around, again you have to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| these are people who rent by choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Could you give an example of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| What is this knitting together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| Best example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| what used to be just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| club room is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| many of them look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| an urban coffee shop in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Gathering places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| They're gathering places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| so the old clubhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| club room has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| a place where people come in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| and can get coffee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| juice and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| get on their laptop or their tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| or their phone or they can watch TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| and hang out with other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| as we call it, they're there together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| by themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| like people are in a coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Those spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| they turn into places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| in the evening where you can pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| chairs around and watch a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| football game on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Saturday or a basketball tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| NCAA period, we often create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| outdoor spaces much like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| a beer garden that have that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| atmosphere where people want to gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| TVs around, tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| where people can congregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Those same spaces inside can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| turn into co-working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| spaces if you've ever heard of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| term, a lot of our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| either work from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| home or they have the option to work from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| their home and so they'll often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| want to have a place where they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| work and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| they can be in a protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| environment in terms of sound but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| can see other people so we try to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| those spaces and those club rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| turn into ad hoc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| office spaces during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3477)|

| 0:58:53| in the lobby which by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| the residents have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| the lobbies 24 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Every space in the building practically they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| access to 24 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Our latest is we've done gift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3543)|

| 0:59:07| dedicated spaces where people can come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| wrap a birthday present or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| something like that. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| least expensive space we build and the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| that's currently the most popular you know go figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| So those are just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| examples and the last thing I'd add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| is if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| anything that would make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| office market more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| viable in downtown to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| I can't think of anything better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| than having more residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| like the ones that we target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| These are people who are well educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| They're usually reasonably affluent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| They're usually still working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| and those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| the kind of people employers want to be near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| and it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| important these days for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| employers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| have access to that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| resident base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| and so I think that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| another part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Thank you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| time and happy to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| have a question. What the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| of the units and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| I know we're looking to the future but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| monthly rents when you talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| particular category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I can give you some general guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| and what we put in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| proposal is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| close to what we would do but there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| a lot more study that will go into that and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| will be many more unit types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| than the ones that are shown in there once we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| into real design work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| anybody can live in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| communities but what we find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| typically is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| most attractive to two demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| segments. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| are people who have just graduated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| from college up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| maybe age 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| they work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| they want a place where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| can come sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| hang out with other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| be near downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| amenities like restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| and bars and shops and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| that hopefully close to work for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| that's typically the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| demographic group we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| the second largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| maybe surprisingly are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| who are 50 and older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| who have decided to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| out of the suburban house and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| live in an environment like downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Knoxville and that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| up usually about 30% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| our residents and that gives you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| an idea of why I call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| these renters by choice. Those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| don't have to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| so we try to tailor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| our unit mix to fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| those two kind of barbell ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| of the barn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| but then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| a mix of everything in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| so for the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| who let's just say has just gotten out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| of UT accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| school and can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| afford a huge rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| payment, maybe they got student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| debt, we'll build some units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| that are small studios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| and small one bedrooms that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| that's at a price point they can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| right now those will probably start if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| were finished today, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| start in the mid $900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| range and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| up from there. We'll build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| larger one bedroom units too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| for that same kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| somebody with a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| income, maybe a little bit more seniority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| and then we'll build some relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| large two bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| maybe even three bedroom units to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| appeal to that empty nester market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| because that demographic usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| is looking for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| large master bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| a nice size bath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| storage space in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| apartment and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| like that and then we'll have kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| everything in between that but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| main focus are on those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| those two unit types if that answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| the question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| And the rent would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| probably go into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| mid $2000 for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| larger apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Mayor Brown. So these would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| apartments and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| condominiums. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Thank you. And did you answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| his question about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| potential price range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Yes. Well, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| it would probably run from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| say around $950| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| a month up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| approximately $2500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Any other questions? Okay. Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you, Charles. And by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| the way, really, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| will work great. We'll just have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| where you don't need to be a lecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| from me. You all know me pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| So if anything comes to mind, please just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| So as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| stand here today, where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| we've put a lot of work into design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| creating the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| If you look at the contract in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| basically the parameters are spelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| out to where we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| The timetable, the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| obviously, and then the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| on the developer side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Many, many of these details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| and some of the things that you're asking about today, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| great questions. We're going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| all those one by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| one in detail, flesh all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| those out during the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| phase to where when that's presented to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| you, you can see exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| what all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| things are that are on your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| I see that as kind of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| where we're very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| We give and take. We figure this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| together and then we come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| with exactly what the development agreement needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| to be. But what I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| to do right now, if I could, if I could take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| a few minutes and let Ferris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| come up from DIA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| and let him walk you through the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| design as it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| As I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| pointing out, we're going to work through all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| the details and the minutia of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| This is a very large project. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| very complicated and it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| important that we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| I look forward to Ferris' presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| Go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and identify yourself for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3921)|

| 1:05:29| and Dwayne especially, is any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| project like this at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| is in the inception stages of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| It will go through various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| stages of design development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| everything from the aesthetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| component to the energy component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| to the sustainability, traffic, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I do realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| at this stage, our design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| appears to be a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| not refined and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| is truly the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| A perfect example of where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| get to from beginning to end is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| if you look at what we're doing at Regis Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| That project has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| started at a very raw stage as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| and then as you develop the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| project, you develop the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| the design is refined and you end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| with a very quality project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Our intent as an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| as developers, as people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| who work downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| live in the city, is to have nothing but a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| looking project that we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| going to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| As I present this, which many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| have seen, what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| going to do is talk about the attributes of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| and why we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| that the design that we have created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| does address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| several issues that we feel are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| important from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| programmatic standpoint, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| a downtown standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| and as well as meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| the big vision that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| by ULI of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| walkable communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| having buildings up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| street in the downtown environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| One of the first things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| were a strong believer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| is the saving of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| the courtroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| at the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| We looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| as basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Rick had noted, that it is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| to be reused as a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| and even a component of it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| basement being used as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| the pet safe doggy daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Perfect use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| by doing that, also we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| created spaces which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| indoor space used for the building, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| as outdoor spaces as well, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| having people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| So as you view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| the design, and I'm not sure if you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| have monitors in front of you or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| behind you, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| you can see how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| form of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| is respecting the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| and how we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| created spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| right here, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| are outdoors, as well as the rooftop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| spaces on the courthouse itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| revitalize that building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| really create a very effective use for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| This is a view from the other side, being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| from Henley Street, where we propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| that the hotel will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| And as you know, the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| does wrap around the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| And what you do not see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| is you don't see a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| There's a four-story garage in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| The garage is pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| wrapped by buildings on all sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| with the exception of the entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| And that was a very strong goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| that we felt very strongly about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| is no matter what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| we did not want to have a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| that had a large garage fronting a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Is this underground, the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| A small part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| is underground, and I'll show you here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| in a moment the rest of the floor plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| this is starting at the very lowest level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| which is at the intersection of Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| and Henley Street at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| corner. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| all this parking is underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| This is the underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| area underneath the Supreme Court building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| And as you can see, this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| residential entrance meant to activate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| the pedestrian area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| of that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| So you've got pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| circulation. You've got the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| here, and this entrance is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| residential parking. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| the residential is above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| And this is one level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| above, and you can see still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| the parking garage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| in the middle, but on the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| which is facing Henley, the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| space is covering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| So from Henley, you will never, ever see a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| garage. Is there any courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| or is it all parking in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| There's a courtyard at the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| of it, and that's part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| initiative for sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Number one, we did not want to look down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| on top of parking. We wanted to look down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| at green space, and also it helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| us in mitigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| stormwater runoff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| So at the Henley Street level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| basically you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| the courtyard, you've got the ported chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| entrance off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| church, which is two-way traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| We're not coming in with an entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| off of Henley. We feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| that's an issue from a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| standpoint. You enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| the lobby. The lobby's got outdoor balconies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| that also overlook Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| Street and against the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Again, the whole idea is to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| have people facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| the street. You've got people at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| entrance, people in the hotel lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| on the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| And also, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| in addition...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| In addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| the basement of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Supreme Court building, as I noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| would be a doggy daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| So again, you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| plenty of people coming and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| along with their dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| So essentially, again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| contributing to the downtown infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| One level above that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| where we get up to Locust Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| and church, we have the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| entrance at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| We have a retail component that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| with the residential. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| the only part that is visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| from the street is the garage entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| here. By this point, you're one level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| above grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| So at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| we have the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| building reused as a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| with outdoor seating as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| And you will notice how these residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| apartments here and here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| are totally concealing the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| as well as the hotel component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| is concealing the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| you've got multiple residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| and pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| interconnectivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| and a separate location for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| car traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| One level above that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| you ramp up the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| up to this highest level of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| And again, the parking is concealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| the 8,000 square feet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| we dedicated for a conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| facility as part of the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| It has an outdoor courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| as well as a balcony over the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| overlooking Henry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| So again, you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| rooftop use and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Supreme Court building as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| as the terraces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| at the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| One level up, and here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| you will see above the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| is the green space in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| along with the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| This space is mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| serving the residential. There could be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| component serving the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| And on this space is where we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| other amenities from the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| being at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| How many stories are you talking about above ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| At this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| it depends what street you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| looking at. That parking level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| is only one story above locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| From| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| it is a three story, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| top of that third story is a green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| I'll show you an image here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| But the apartments go up higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Yes, they do. And the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| So again, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| I'm not sure why I've got this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| in twice, but it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| So that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| again the component of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| conference center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| So this is a view of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| from the corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Church and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Henley. This is the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| closest to the entrance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| There are currently cross sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| here, cross sidewalks on Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| There are red lights as well at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| intersection. So that's why we felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| very strongly that this should be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| entrance to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| At this location, you'll see the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Even though it's five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| stories above the garage level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| those two levels are facing the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| and therefore you never see the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| This is the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| entrance and portico| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| chair coming off Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| And basically there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| a portico chair across here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| the garage entrance, and up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| is the top of the courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| which will have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| on it, etc. that overlook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| this area as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| connect to the rest of the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| This level is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| the conference center which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| overlook again Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Street and the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| as well as this entrance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| parking of the hotel entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| How many square feet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| the conference center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| 8,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Turning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4495)|

| 1:16:10| Ac, wrth fynd i'r ystafell, un o'r pethau rydyn ni'n eisiau ei wneud yw creu'r aelodau llanwyr yma ar locwst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4570)|
| 1:16:22| i greu lle anodd ar gyfer ymdrech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4582)|

| 1:16:52| Mae'r ystafell yn cael falconiau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Mae'r ystafell yn cael sferysau a falconiau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4614)|

| 1:17:14| A yw'r amgylcheddau cyhoeddus yn ail ag y restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4634)|

| 1:17:36| ac rwy'n credu bod y rhan fwyaf o'r amgylcheddau ynghylch yr ystafell yn cael falconiau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=4656)|

| 1:26:01| This is an opportunity that, you know, we've got to drive the design, and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| I think it's so important, and it sets the tone for the next building and the next building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| and it's why it's got to, you know, get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| You've sacrificed a lot for the historic preservation of that courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| We sacrifice, we're sacrificing a lot for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| I mean, just look at it, you've carved out a pretty big chunk of land that you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| building on top of it to save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| You look at the footprint of the overall block of what's occupied by the courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| given where your revenue opportunities are, you know, if you were strictly looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| it dollars and cents, you'd, the courthouse is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| But that's not the way we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| So saving the courthouse was, I mean, that was at the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| I mean, I'm a historic preservationist person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| That's a pretty big sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| I can't not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| I mean, if that goes away, I'm walking away from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| But it's a pretty big, it's a pretty big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| Indeed, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| And I mean, I think this is the kind of, exactly the kind of stuff that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| And, you know, we don't like the word compromise, but ultimately, compromise is how you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| to where, from a surface parking lot that's sitting out there with a hideous 20-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| empty office building, to something that we can all be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| And let me say just one word, and I'll get off this in Ferris's defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| When you look at the RFP, you know, we had a number of things we had to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and come back on this, and we were taxed on time to get into a lot of the detail on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| the design side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| So we, I think rightly, deferred a lot of this to the development agreement, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| where we can all come to the table, roll up our sleeves, lay everything out, and see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| you know, what do you like, what do you don't like, what do you see more of, what do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| want to see less of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| So we will figure this out together, hand-in-hand, and Charles and I have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| and we are totally open to this being an absolutely open partnership, where you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| exactly what you think, to the extent we can get there, that we do it where we all get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| what we want, and what we think, you know, is ultimately best for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| And I think we've all got our hearts in the right place, and we're willing to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| that risk and make that private investment to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| Talk about that hotel, and how convinced are you that that's the right brand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| And I don't know if Whitestone Lodging is here, I mean, how convinced are you that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| the right, and convince us, or maybe you convince us down the road, that this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| right brand and the right thing for Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Well, I think where we are right now with Aloft, and I'm sorry White Lodging couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| be here today, they're having their annual corporate executive retreat, so they're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| out, who knows where, but they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Anyway, when we proposed for Aloft, Aloft is a very hip, millennial-oriented brand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| was originated by Starwood Hotel Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| And when we proposed this, Starwood was an independent New York Stock Exchange company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| Starwood has since been acquired by Marriott Corporation in a huge transaction that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| while this property was, while this whole project was under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| And personally, my feel is that when we get into the development agreement, we basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| there are no sacred cows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| So I think we come back in and we make Aloft come in here and sell us, we make Marriott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| come to the table and show us why we ought to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I'll just tell you candidly, I've been approached by Hilton and by Hyatt to drop Aloft, or at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| least give them a shot to come in front of everybody and make their pitch for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Everybody's trying to get in this upper, upscale brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| So earlier it was announced, well, how does Aloft fit into pricing and whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| They fit really well in the upper, upscale brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I mean, their national numbers are 15% higher than their competitive set nationwide in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| markets they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| They're in the exact, kind of the same market that Hyatt Place is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Hyatt Place does even better than Aloft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Hyatt Place does better than Marriott Courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| They're all in the same, they all compete kind of in the same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| So the good news is we're a big enough market, this is a high-profile project, every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| one of the major hotel players wants in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| And Hilton, for instance, they've got three brand new brands now that you've probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| never heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Tapestry, Curio, Canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| I mean, these are hotels, there are only a few of them, two of them are concepts they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| bought in Europe and there are only a couple of them in the United States already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| But in Tapestry, they created from scratch and they're ready to roll that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| So I think, you know, as part of, this was alluded to earlier, why does all this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| take so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Golly, does it ever take so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| That's my world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| I wish I could hit the fast forward on everything, but, you know, these things take forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| No, they don't take forever, but they're excruciatingly slow process and everybody's got to touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| this thing and it's got to go where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| My personal feeling would be that as we get into the development agreement, we bring Marriott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| in and we bring the Starwood people in that are now part of their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| We bring Hilton in, we bring Hyatt in, and let's hear their pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| White Lodging operates for all of them, they're the largest Marriott operator in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| They were the first Marriott franchisee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| They're the number one operator for Hyatt, they run the highest rev par and the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| one Hyatt Place hotel in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| They also operate like 50 Hilton products, so we've got the right operator, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| the best operator in the business, so, and they will connect us with everybody we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| to talk to and we can have them lined up and come in here one after another if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| want to have a design charrette or we want to have a brand charrette or all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| I would say let's do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| I mean, before, candidly, before, you know, we dropped the dime on writing some pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| big checks and, you know, I say we get them all in here, we take another look at it, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| With an ADR of $119 a night, right, so your ADR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| That won't float this hotel, not at $119.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| They run 115% of their comp set nationwide, Aloft does, so which, that's impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5519)|
| 1:32:06| You know, it's like everybody's kids, they're all above average, right, so I think the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| I think the way to do this is just open it up and take a look at it, you know, if I walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| in here with a brand that makes everybody's, can I do that, then, you know, throw me out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| or tell me no and send me back to the drawing board, I'm okay with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| I don't think that's what we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| This is an upper upscale site and all the big brands know it and they all want in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| And I say, I don't see any harm in letting them take a pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Of that design that you have, it says four different buildings, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Are they connected in any way or are they all just stand alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| They stand alone, the two, the parking lot is a subterranean parking lot that covers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| a lot, most of the site except for the Supreme Court building and then the other, the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| building and the multi-family building essentially sit on top of portions of the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| so they're engineered to hold that weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| So, Mr. Eade, how long does it take to complete what you have designed there roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| I'm sorry, how long does it take to complete it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| A project like this will take a good 8 to 12 months worth of time of working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| all the programming and detailing and the end of the construction drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| You're talking design part, right, not construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Correct, yeah, to the end of the construction documents essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| Construction, I'm guessing somewhere in the range of about 18 to 24 months on a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| of this size, probably a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| I saw the set two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| So Parris, I have a question along the lines with design and I echo what George has talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5634)|
