| 0:02:27| That was the request for the house located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| on the corner of Lindsay and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| where they were asking to go from residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| And we do that one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| And we'd like to make sure that we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| it is going to be turned into a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=162)|

| 0:03:00| spent quite a bit of time in the last several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| and they've come up with a memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| And so they are asking to withdraw their appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=186)|

| 0:07:11| But we are actively supporting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| which has been in development for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| to provide an alternative to jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| for nonviolent offenders with mental health and addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=440)|

| 0:07:23| be run by Helen Ross McNabb with financial support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| from the county, the city, and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| There was an informational meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| But there are obviously still some unanswered questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| among some people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| So this meeting on Thursday will provide a full description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| of the project by McNabb, also comments by Sheriff Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=459)|

| 0:08:24| who are celebrating 40 years with the city, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=504)|

| 0:08:38| is just a small way of expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=518)|

| 0:18:08| as storage for commercial refrigeration business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| that they owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Danny and I both were born and raised here in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1092)|

| 0:18:57| large commercial prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Our area needs an alternative to large businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| People should not have to travel west to be able to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1142)|

| 0:19:20| Would you like to pass that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And this is a list of the signatures of everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1163)|

| 0:19:28| and all the area businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| And also, can I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| I also contacted the Fountain City Town Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| because I know they had an issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| There was no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| And I looked it up online to get a hold of somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| And it just says the 2015 and 16 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| So I wanted to try to talk to him to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| any questions they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I think some of them are here tonight to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1196)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| OK, now this is Michelle French.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| My name's Michelle French, 7401 Quail Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| And I've worked for Kelly for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| Her hair salon and boutique are both very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| And I currently manage the boutique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| And we have literally grown out of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| And there's a need for a full boutique in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| in the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| As of now, pretty much the patrons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| have to drive west and the Powell area to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| And moving our boutique to the new location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| would not only be beneficial for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| but it would also be a great improvement on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| that's sat empty for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| And in return, would be very beneficial for Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Kelly really does care about the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| She's, like I said, been in business there for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| I've lived there my whole life, too, as well as her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We went to school together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| And she really wants what's best for her community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| And she does a great job with her small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1267)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| And now Mr. Jobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| My name is Danny Jobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| I live at 3837 Hollyberry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| I don't really have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| I just don't put my name in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| I'm here to show your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1284)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| OK, now the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Carleen Malone and then Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1288)|
| 0:21:36| Welcome, and you know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you, Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| We ask that our letter dated February 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| be included in the record and a copy of it has been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| The board of Fountain City Town Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| asks that you deny the appeals and uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| the recommendation of the professional MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| and the unanimous decision of the MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| We ask this based on the record and the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| As we stated in our letter, we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| the appeals should be denied for three valid reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| One, as the staff report points out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| there is sufficient commercially zoned property in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| to meet the present demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Two, the sector plan recommends commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| be concentrated in the Broadway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Three, rezoning this property risks destabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| the entire residential block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| The staff report also makes clear the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| that the planned amendment and rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| fail to meet the legally required standards that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| must be met in order to approve a change in land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| Those standards basically deal with changed or changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| We also call to your attention the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| to protect and preserve existing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| Older neighborhoods and older housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| are easily destabilized and need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| protected from destabilizing and incompatible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| Protecting and preserving affordable neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| located near excellent public schools and other community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| institutions with easy access to both public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| and within walking distance of employment centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| should be a priority for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| For these reasons, we ask that you deny the appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| We thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Mrs. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| I'm trying to figure out why this is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| It's on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I'm going to have to ask Abby to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| She will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1439)|
| 0:23:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I'm Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| I reside at 104 Crawford Road in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and I'm a member of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| As a resident of Fountain City and a member of Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| Town Hall, I ask that you deny this request for a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| If approved, it would be a textbook example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| of what a domino effect will cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| As Ms. Malone has already stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| the homes that are south of this property that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| being asked for rezoning are well-kept residential homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| are well-kept residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| And this truly would have a negative effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| The appellant, you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| for a two-minute rebuttal, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| I just want to state again that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| sat empty for 10-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| I mean, something, you know, it's going downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| It needs something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| The neighborhood needs something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Like I said, I have the house in the best interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| you know, in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| The lady that owned it was Ms. Tudor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| That's actually the name of the boutique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| was going to be Tudor House Boutique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I love the history of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| I by no means want to mess with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| I just want to add to it and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| a successful small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| And like I said, we're just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| to have one person working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| It's going to be very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| The lady down the street said that that was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| She would have somewhere she could walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| All the people across the street were so excited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| you know, I don't know what else I could say except that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| it would be great for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| 54 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Danny, do you only get one speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I'm sorry, the law director corrected me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| which is his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| OK, I guess you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| If I'm not wanting a domino effect by no means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I'm fine with it being C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| The guy at MPC just told me originally C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| I don't know if there's any way I can drop it back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| I just want to have a boutique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| I don't, you know, I don't by no means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| want to sell it and make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| You know, what I'm after is just a small boutique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I don't know if I don't know that much about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| I don't know if office would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| or if dropping down to C1 would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| If C3's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1618)|
| 0:26:58| OK, well let's see if council can get into their questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1622)|
| 0:27:02| If you just want to stick close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| All right, OK, your time is basically up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| OK, Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| You know, this is a tough one in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| That is, the people have come forward and purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| this relatively small house, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| want to move a portion of their business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| It's a very small place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I don't know how you park cars in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| It's almost near the road, maybe 50 feet back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| But more importantly, this is not on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| It's not on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| It's not in the commercial centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Now, it's very close, and I give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| But it doesn't have any road access from Tazewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| And so what we're going to have is, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| is cars leaving the main thoroughfare, Tazewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| and going down a small, narrow side street that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| has houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Now, there is commercial on the corner, and she is next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| That's what troubles me in terms of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| there's some question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| But I really do think that if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| going to start changing the nature of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| it might be smarter to have a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| a small area looked at by MPC or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| But once we start chipping away at the residential character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| there, I think we do hurt the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and I think we do some harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| And you know, the young lady has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Ms. Jobe, that she's only going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| one worker and not many cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| But the zoning goes with the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and who knows what comes next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| I understand they have several other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| on that same area, and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| whether they want to convert more houses after this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| But I think we need to stick with what MPC said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| that we're trying to channel the traffic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| the commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| And I hate that they're sort of on the spot, in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| But they obviously bought it knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| it was a residential zoning listing on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| So they took it with the subject of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| With regard to the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I noticed that MPC did say at the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| that we don't recommend this, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| need to do something on the commercial side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| don't go any further than C1, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Mr. Kelly's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| I don't know if you want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I certainly think that normally you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| will say that the transition from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| to a higher or a more busy use is to go to office and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1781)|
| 0:29:41| So maybe you could just tell us the perspective of MPC on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Excuse me, the Dan Kelly MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| As you noted, it said the staff is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| recommending the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| but it was laying out an option there for the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| commission to consider if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| They chose not to consider that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and denied the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| This is a classic example of you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| got to draw a line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| There are zoning lines, and when you draw that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| there are people on one side of the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| will have the commercial zoning, and the one on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| will have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| And by moving that line, all you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| is moving the impact to an adjoining piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| And that's what the heart of the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| is, really, that by going across the alley and moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| or the street there, you're basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| opening up another block for potential commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| on down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| So realistically, if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| to start tackling a block, you ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| to look at the whole thing and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| analyze it as a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| rather than sort of starting it haphazardly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| The property there to the south of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| is a commercial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| At one time, it was developed with other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| It's been developed into a commercial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| It turns in on itself, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| where it's a better type of commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| than you would where you go in and reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| a house in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| All right, thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Have you all put together a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| or you've got two structures on that property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| You've got a house, and you've got a garage out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Yes, and right there behind the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| You've got an alley that runs between you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| and the next property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Yes, and the property that's right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| is in on this, just enough for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| So it'd be behind the building, not in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| where the street is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| You've got enough room to put, I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| ample parking is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| I think they said four spots, but yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| I think it is a little bit troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| I mean, you have a vacant piece of property for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| It's absolutely doing no good on tax rolls whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Several of those properties are in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Out of the 10 properties that are in that little section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| 10 are in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| It's multifamily apartments behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| You go further south, it's multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| It's Martin, which is a lot heavier traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| than a single-use commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| I don't think traffic is really the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I think the greater issue is singling out that one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| on that street without looking at all 10 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| And it may be a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I think you'd have to decide whether you wanted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| or not, whether that's a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Small commercial properties are hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| It's in demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| It would have strong demand as a single-tenant or single-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| building, unlike being in a shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| where the rents are higher and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| other expenses with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| People want standalone properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| And you can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| I think one of the best examples of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| are those type of properties in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| on Chambliss Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Those houses, those were all houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Now they're all small, individual, single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| proprietary type of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| They're well-used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| And the structures are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| You maintain the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| But sitting vacant for 10 years is not helping us either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| So I think it's the bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| And I think probably a better zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| would have probably been either office or not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| So I'm really kind of torn by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| I think it's probably got potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| to look at on a bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I'm not sure that I can support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| the way it is, the way you've submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| But I think there is a good need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| I'm not sure that I agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| There's ample surplus commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| We own the property across Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| directly across from Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| When we bought that, we tore down two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Because you couldn't find a large enough piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| So those type of properties are in very strong demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| for single-use buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| But I think at this point, the way it's submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| and what's been presented to us tonight, I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| George, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| And I agree with Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I think the best way to go with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| would be to look at the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I'm not comfortable taking this one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| and doing something different with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| If we looked at the whole area, and so Nick's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| that we do some sort of small area plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| and I don't know what the timing is on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| but I'm not comfortable supporting this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| And I would recommend, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| that we go ahead and deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And then if you want to take it back and pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| some sort of small area deal, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I was just going to add to that, that when the next one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| plan comes up, or the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| they could look at, is there a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| to expand commercial in this kind of smaller commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| But to just do one out of context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| kind of wrecks the neighborhood idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| I'll second his motion if he hasn't already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| OK, so we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| The appeal is denied, which then makes 10B moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| So, and 10C was withdrawn, so we move on to resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| to execute an agreement with C.M. Henley Company, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2149)|

| 0:35:56| for an amount not to exceed $33,726.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2166)|

| 0:36:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2187)|
| 0:36:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| to execute an agreement with Massey Construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2192)|

| 0:36:42| not to exceed $136,711.70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2211)|
| 0:36:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| to enter into a license agreement with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| of Tennessee for the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| and maintenance of a riverwalk connector, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| will provide pedestrian access and streetscape enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| under the Henley Bridge as part of the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| of Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2230)|
| 0:37:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Yeah, I just want to, as Don Michelle's still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Don Michelle, obviously the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| has the bridge and the bindings that it sits on or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| I assume that we're just getting permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| to use the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| But all the expenses arise, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| The state does not do anything other than say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| you can go on it and do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Don Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| This is just to access under the Henley Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| to connect the riverwalks that are being constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| as part of the enhancement of redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| of the Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| TDOT, I mean, when it was a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| it had access and permitted use from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Because of the change in ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| we had to go through the same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| to get access to connect the riverwalk under Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Will Southeastern actually do the construction of the walk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2283)|
| 0:38:03| It's part of that development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| will go with the private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| and the public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| 11E is a resolution to waive city of Knoxville taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| on certain surplus properties pursuant to Tennessee code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| annotated sections 67-5-2507B5 and 67-5-2508D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| and to authorize their sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| I'll kick it back to Charles a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| and talk a little bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| make sure that we understand this exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| This is something that happens in the ordinary course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| We have a number of properties that get sold in the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| A number of those properties are upside down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| in that what is owed in terms of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| far exceeds the fair market value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| And it used to be, until a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| we couldn't sell it without getting the taxes paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| So the legislature changed that rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| so that now we can waive some of the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and sell it for what we can get for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| and the rest of the taxes then will be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| So we'll get it back on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| which is a very important aspect of dealing with these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| And is that sale still subject to the one-year redemption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| OK. No change on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| No change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| No waive on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| So whatever we have against it, taxes, penalties, interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| whatever, you sell it for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| You sell it for anything, then you just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| That is the final sales price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| then they're given their deed to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| subject to the one-year redemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| It gets sold at auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| and you take the highest price you can get, and then whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| We'll take all of that money that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| and apply it in a pro rata fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| to both the county and the city taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| and then the rest of it gets waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| So the lucky owner that buys it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| for the owner that currently owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| that has the one-year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| So do they have to pay the entire amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| or do they just have to pay what we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| They redeem the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| They've got to pay all the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| They're not given any exclusion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| To redeem it, you've got to pay the full freight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| OK. We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Jim, was there something you want to clarify on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Just a point of clarification, Jim, your finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| These are properties that we have acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| the city has acquired in a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and the one-year right of redemption is already run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| So at that point, the right of redemption does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| These are things where the right of redemption is already run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| You're the subsequent purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| so the clock was running against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Once this takes place, once it is sold, it is sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| There is no right of redemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| It's an absolute sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Sir, they offered the same Clark & Masters deed then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| What kind of deed do they get when they buy them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| I believe it's just a quit claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| I don't know the answer to that. I'll have to ask Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Doug takes care of preparing that deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I'm sure I signed it, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| I should have asked Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| What did you hear? I should have asked Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| It says on most of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Rob, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I did talk to Mr. Gordon about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| It would be, I guess, a quit claim deed because the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| he was saying there's some issue whether or not the city can indemnify a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| When someone is granted a warranty deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| there are certain things that come with it, promises that imply defending title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| He said there's an issue whether or not a city could give a warranty deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| so he was thinking quit claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| So we dump it and we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to approve the sale of three surplus decommissioned police utility vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| to the McCreary County, Kentucky Sheriff's Office for a total purchase amount of $10,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2555)|

| 0:42:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| 11G is a resolution expressing appreciation for a sponsorship of $1,000 from the South Knoxville Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| and the South Knoxville Community Center Young at Heart Club to partially fund the purchase of a treadmill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| for the South Knoxville Community Center and authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary to accept said donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| So council, I just wanted to share this was the South Knoxville Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| they had their quarterly soup dinner where, you know, a lot of people come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| they put in their donation for their meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and different groups submit proposals for what they would like to see funded with all the donations that were made that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| So Debbie Beeler from our South Knox Community Center, who's the recreation director, she submitted a proposal for the treadmill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| And so they won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| It was the largest dinner in the history of the quarterly soup dinners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| I think perhaps a lot of the people who used the center came to support her on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| And so they raised something like $709 from that dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| And then the Young at Heart Club, the senior club at the center, put in the other $291.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| So between the two groups they raised the money thanks to South Knoxville Alliance and Young at Heart Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| So we just want to thank both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Good public spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Yes, excellent public spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| So now they're going to have a new treadmill down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Seven and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to agreement C-16-0302| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee pursuant to a grant modification from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women to coordinate the Abuse in Later Life Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| to extend the term of agreement and to increase the contract amount by $166,515| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| for a new total contract amount not to exceed $289,251.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Chief, I can't resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| You've got to tell us a little bit about this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I mean, I'm worried about these seniors getting abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I didn't think it happened much, but I'm learning slow but sure that it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Yeah, so this is a federal grant that we received, actually, in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| and it's really a majority of it is about training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| So the grant will train all of the officers in the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| all the officers in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| They've already had the DA's office has already received training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| We'll be training some judges as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| and it's really about making us aware of all of the issues that you deal with with elder abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| and that's everything from not only physical abuse but financial abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Does it get reported much, or is it one of those hidden crimes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| No, it is reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| There is more education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| That's another part of the grant is educating the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| especially those in their senior years, on being aware of what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| This is one of those crimes that sometimes doesn't get reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| because it's family who's doing it, specifically on the financial crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Taking grandma's funds or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, and so this is really about what to look for and how to look for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| and how to properly investigate as well as prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| And I see in here that you're also getting a full-time case manager to help the victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Yes, that will be part of assisting the victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Mr. Chief, I want to ask you, most of this occurs domestically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| but do you have many instances of this occurring in health care facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| It does on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| This grant isn't really focused on the health care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| There is the state elder abuse investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| There's a whole separate unit that deals with health care facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| and they do that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| This is really more about domestic in terms of what's going on in homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2810)|

| 0:48:50| Actually, Councilman, what this is is a new law that went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| From Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Yeah, a state law that went into effect that allows law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| that we may impound a vehicle if there's no proof of insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| when we're out with them, either on a traffic crash or on a traffic stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| And so what this does then is it makes it common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| If we impound the vehicle because you had no insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| this makes it common sense that you need to have insurance to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| But it's also for all vehicles that we impound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| So every vehicle that's impounded, you now will need to show proof of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| State law requires you to have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| So you don't drive off and hurt somebody and have no coverage at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| The next items were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| So, Council, we're at the end of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| and there's no one signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170228?start=2986)|
