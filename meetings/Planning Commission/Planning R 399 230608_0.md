| 0:22:00| Applicants reason for closure to allow the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture to better control and manage access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| It is the East Tennessee Agricultural Research and Education Center, the Holston unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Approve the request to close the portion of Riverside Drive from the southwest corner of parcel 096, 01104, to where it meets Chris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1335)|
| 0:22:25| Then closing Chris Road in its entirety, subject to retaining all easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| Since staff has received no objections and closure would not adversely affect surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Ethan Parker, Director, East Tennessee Agricultural Research and Education Center, including the Holston unit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| Our intent to close this down is security concern regarding students, research animals, staff, and faculty at the institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| We've had multiple crimes and things committed all the way up to our front door of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| We also have inhabitants that live there on the site to take care of the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| So we want to basically close that road, put a gate there for security purposes, as well as cameras to monitor, just to keep us from basically having more crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1386)|
| 0:23:17| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| All right. Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the request as submitted and approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| I did, because I don't know if it's relevant, but there was someone who was objecting to this and was asking to be added in online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| That was a comment that I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Ms. Karen, do you have any information about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Michelle Porche was the one that communicated with her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| She was going to be in the air, and at the outside chance that her plane was going to land possibly, hopefully, sometime around 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1430)|
| 0:24:01| but she did not request that we postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| She couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| She was going to speak if she could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| She had submitted questions through our public comments button that would be addressed to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| I think she had tried to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| She submitted those questions to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| I can answer those if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Her first question was regarding the turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| She was worried her driveway would be turned around in if we closed this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Our intent is to use our property to create a full roundabout turnaround there, including 18-wheeler trucks, so we can prevent that for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1478)|
| 0:24:47| I think her second concern was around pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| The gate will be open during all operating business hours when we have staff present at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| which will be the majority of hours from about 6 a.m. to about 6 p.m. every day, including some weekends, to allow pedestrians to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1495)|
| 0:25:04| There is an eagle's nest there, and I think she was interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Her third question actually escapes me, but I can pull it up, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| I have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| She was asking if a sign could be placed down the street to mitigate traffic, like a dead-end sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| But I don't know what constitutes that from a city's perspective, what criteria is required to put a dead-end sign on a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| Yeah, we have no opposition to put a sign there, talking about the fact that there's no outlet there and providing that turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1528)|
| 0:25:39| All right, so we have a motion to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Commissioner Barger provided the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Seeing no other likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Agenda item seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Applicant Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Location, north of Southern Avenue and east of Victory Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| Approximate size of track, 17,010 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Present plan and zoning designation, MDRO, medium density residential office, RN-4, general residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1571)|
| 0:26:19| Proposed plan designation, MUSD, MUCC21, central city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| Existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| There are a total of three potential motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| Motion number one, deny the sector plan amendment to the MUSD, CC21, mixed use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1595)|
| 0:26:46| southern and north side land use classification because it does not meet the requirements for a land use amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| Motion number two, deny the one year plan amendment to MUSD for the same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| Motion number three, deny CG2 zoning district because it is an intensive encroachment into the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1622)|
| 0:27:11| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Yes, I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Garrett Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| So we feel what we're trying to get, what we're trying to do with this property is maintain the residential use of the property to install seven townhomes on the 17,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1647)|
| 0:27:41| And I had originally called down to MPC and spoke with Liz Albertson, who's no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| And during those discussions, I told her we were planning to come for rezoning and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| I wanted her help finding a zone that would allow for more creativity and some more flexibility on the lot other than the R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| And during our discussions, that's what led to her suggesting the extension of the MUSD and the rezoning to CG2 because it is a mixed use zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1683)|
| 0:28:17| And we are so close to Sutherland Avenue and the CG2 is an existing zone and so is the MUSD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| And she subsequently left MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| And then I got a call from Ms. Hillman and she said that, you know, staff had a different idea and wanted to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1709)|
| 0:28:38| However, you know, I believe that with all due respect, staff is leaning on some technical definitions of the extension of the MUSD and the CG2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1718)|
| 0:28:52| Sutherland Avenue has historically been a mixed use district all the way down to, you know, its intersection with, I think it was at Westwood over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1732)|
| 0:29:04| and then all the way down to Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| So, you know, this is a simple extension of the existing overlay and the existing zone that already exists in and around Victory Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1747)|
| 0:29:19| And so our plan is to use the CG2 as the mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| A portion of the mixed use is to keep it residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| And it allows us to bring the buildings closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I've handed out – you all should have this package that I left on your desk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| There's a site plan in the rear as a kind of preliminary plan as to what we're proposing there, seven townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| And the CG2, the design standards that we have for that and the dimensional standards allow for us to get that many units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1785)|
| 0:29:57| Mr. Jernigan, would you care to give us your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Yes, sir. It's 5246 Bent River Boulevard, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| All right. Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Ms. Hillman, and maybe the applicant, there's one structure that appears to be on two different lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| Is that approaching on yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| That's an error on the GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| We've had it surveyed, and they're on their property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| So if this were R and 4, that would be the only remaining structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| We don't own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| It would be the only remaining structure on that block, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| After you demolish those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| And I believe that the majority of the properties that are on Victory Street, as short as it is, are non-owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1852)|
| 0:31:02| So they are investment properties, and the state owns the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| Ms. Hillman, then, if there's only one house, a new residential structure, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| it's supposed to be set back what the average of the block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So would we just go with that one house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Is that what the determination would be off of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| If that was being demolished, that would be the defining one on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1887)|
| 0:31:43| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1903)|
| 0:31:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| And this is a question more for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| In the reason for denial, it stated that it's an encroachment and out of characteristic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| How are seven townhomes more encroaching on the neighborhood than right next door the mobile home park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| which has almost as many per the square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Yeah, the development plan itself is not necessarily out of character with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| The concern is all the potential uses that are possible with the commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| which include things like a drug treatment clinic, a halfway house, a music venue, liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| These kinds of uses would also be possible with that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| And those are the considerations we take, not specific development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Sorry for the feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1964)|
| 0:32:54| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| I guess just a follow-on question from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| The ones that you had mentioned, are those a use on review or are they by right in CG1 or 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| whichever we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| The townhome concept here would be permitted by right in the commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| Is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Well, partially, but I guess more with you had mentioned the substance abuse clinics and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Most of those are permitted by right, I can verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| I guess I'll finish up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| But just in general, as I'm looking at it and seeing even where Division Street is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| Victory Street is a very short street in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| If you take Victory Street all the way over to Division Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| you've got a large area owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| It's zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And then we've got CG again, CG1 on the corner of Division and Victory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2032)|
| 0:34:01| and CG2 on the corner of Victory and Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| and we're just kind of sandwiched in between with a type of a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| I mean, I don't see any real issue with connecting the two down Victory Street personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I was thinking about this, and I asked this Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| is there an alternative zone that would give them the ability to do these townhomes on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2068)|
| 0:34:39| without going to commercial, and I think the answer was there is not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| So within the current land use classification of medium-density residential office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| residential zoning up to RN6 is permitted by right, or can be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| which permits by right multifamily and townhome development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| However, there are setbacks and other considerations that do limit the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| So, in effect, there's not really an alternative other than having the commercial attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| With the setbacks, they wouldn't be able to do what they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| And I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I mean, it's going to stay as a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| and maybe we should have a zone that allows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| or they could get some variances for the setbacks or whatever in cases like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| but since there's not one, I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| And I think we can get around the things have not changed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| Things have changed in our entire county in the last three or four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| with people moving here and the desire for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| We just watched a presentation Tuesday that talked about how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| how far we're behind on the availability of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I'm in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| So you're saying it's a logical extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Have you all considered multifamily instead of townhouses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| Well, on the first blush as to what we were trying to get proposed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| we looked at several different opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| We own this property, so the main goal is to keep it residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Right now, Studio 4, they presented, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| three different ideas as to how it could work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and this is the one we settled on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| The reason I point that out or ask that is because under current zoning R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| it would be permitted to do five townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| or eight multifamily units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| So you could actually get higher density if you went with the multifamily direction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| That is what you're saying is accurate per the way it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| However, when you get down into the nitty-gritty of the lot coverage ratios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| the impervious surface, you can't get to four-story units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| or, excuse me, four-unit buildings on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And then if I understand correctly, the CG does not have any density requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| I didn't hear that last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| CG didn't have what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| It does not have any density requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| This is more a question for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| I think it was two agenda reviews ago we had the city come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| talking about the missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| This fits very much in character with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| and what I'm hearing is there's really nothing in the code that's going to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| in looking at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So my recommendation is we probably need to go back to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| and really look at what might need to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| as they move down that route of looking at that missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| because I think this is going to become more and more of a problem for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| without having that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| I'm trying to follow the comments about why you can't do what the applicant wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| because it sounds like it is permissible in the current zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| if he came back and asked for variances for the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Is there anything beyond the setbacks that are the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| Did I miss something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| So typically a variance from the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| requires some sort of hardship specific to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| so they would have to provide some sort of rationale for that hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2341)|
| 0:39:11| It can't be economic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| It can't be an economic hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| I guess I'm hearing this not as an economic hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| but one of the specific location is being problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| It seems like everyone's kind of in favor of this being a residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| and there have been a lot of reasons cited as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| I don't think it's probably a good practice to say that because we have lots of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| moving to the area that that's a change in character for every case that we hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| But I think that this seems like something that sounds really doable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| except for this one distinction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| but I'm not comfortable with changing it to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| for the reasons that the planning staff noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| But I do think that it's a great concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| I think Commissioner Roth noted that his reasoning was a logical extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I'm on the fence with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| but at the same time we keep talking about, well, this isn't possible with the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| but townhomes are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| You just can't cram seven on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| So less is possible as it's currently zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| and maybe RN6 could squeeze another one on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| But I'm on the fence, and I don't really know how I'd want to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| and I don't want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Someone just can't come up and say, well, I have this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I want to build a skyscraper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| It's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Well, yeah, it's not going to be possible in most places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| So we need to make sure whether you lose a couple of units on a proposed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| it doesn't mean it's not possible to develop the townhome still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| I think we need to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| It is right next to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| There will only be one other residential house on this side of the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| So if that gets torn down and then there's townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| how much character of a residential block does that still retain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| even if only four townhomes are put there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| So maybe seven wouldn't be fine because there's just one other house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| I keep going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| but I think this is tough because we've got other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| South Knoxville has a form-based code that would probably allow this many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| townhomes on it without having to be zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| And being zoned commercial also gives me quite a few worries with what could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| potentially sort of encroach into some other homes over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| So this is a difficult one, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Just a couple of comments and one in response to Commissioner Smith's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| For example, she also just mentioned that maybe an R and 6 could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| But even with an R and 6, they could get the same amount of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| but R and 6, to their point, has a more intense front setback of 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| which in this case I think would kind of require a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| But to your comment about some other tool for, and this is beyond this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| I think this is a really good example for why we need another alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| In a situation like this, it's kind of like this is a very good use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| but it doesn't really seem to fit any of the zonings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| It also doesn't seem to really work for the criteria for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| but it also doesn't really work for a planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| which would kind of allow some of these exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| So I do think, in thinking about the bigger picture opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| some way that we could take examples like this and say, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| maybe it makes sense to get an extra unit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| or maybe this setback doesn't make sense in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| And whether that's through this body or through staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| something other than the criteria of a variance, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| would be a really good tool to accomplish these goals that the city has set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| So just throwing that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| maybe we could address conversations like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Why does planned development not work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| I may have a better answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| but my answer would be the criteria for planned development requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| substantial neighborhood benefit, among some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| And I think it would be hard to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| I think this would create a neighborhood benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| but to that extent of a substantial neighborhood benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| But maybe planned development language, if it were toned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| could become an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Planned development was really intended for projects that don't specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| fit anywhere into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| Isn't there an acreage requirement, a minimum acreage requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| In the county there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| With that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you, Chairman Hill, for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| I'm going to jump out there and make a motion to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| amendment to MUSD CC21, mixed-use special district, southern and north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| I guess we need a reason, which is just a logical extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Logical extension being the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| So we have a motion to approve the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| Commissioner Phillips' motion, and a second by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Seeing no other like, we do have a like here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Yeah, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| I just wanted to make sure that everybody also looked at the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| to see that there's quite a bit of depth of CG2 up and down Southern Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| and even industrial and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| even if we're taking a little bit of a risk on the zoning on the townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| I think new development down through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| with all the nasty stuff that's been going on over all those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| I think it's healthy for this part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| And the more new development, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And hopefully this will be a catalyst to keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| So thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2757)|

| 0:46:04| Chair will entertain another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Motion to approve one-year plan amendment to MUSDCC21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| mixed-use special district, Sutherland Northside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2771)|

| 0:46:21| seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2781)|

| 0:47:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Agenda item nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Applicant Juan Hernandez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Location, north side of Valley View Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| east of Fairway Road, west of Vera Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| Approximate size of track, 1.54 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Present zoning are in 1C, single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Zoning requested are in 4C, general residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| existing land use, agricultural forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Staff recommendation is to approve are in 2C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| single-family residential neighborhood zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Let's go to staff and talk about, just for the public, the C designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| Yes, the C indicates a former planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| This used to be RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| And I should clarify from agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| we talked about how the standard density that could be considered there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| was 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| But based on a former planning commission case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| two lots down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| it indicated that the density here was 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| And so we will be administratively proposing that that be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| that planned district designation be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| at the next planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| because no development plan was ever submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| Okay, is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| My name is Juan Hernandez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| and I came to represent my client, Fort 3507 Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Would you like to go first or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Nick can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2953)|
| 0:49:29| Sorry, I didn't sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2970)|
| 0:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Hi, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| I am Jessica Bowack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| I live at 3801 Valley View Drive, so two lots down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| I also own the back parcel, which is 3803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| I'm very much against this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| I view these as apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I do not want apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| In addition, I'm concerned about the increased traffic on Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Valley View already is 35 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| but people consistently go 40 and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| The lot is also up on a blind hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| so increased traffic is going to make it more difficult for people leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| In addition, I'm really concerned about the increased noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| Also, there was no plan submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| so I'm not sure are they going to be three-story buildings that are looking into my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| If I wanted to live near apartments and I would have bought a house close to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| I bought this property and land because I wanted it to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| It's an RN1 zone single family, and that's what I would like to keep it as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Sorry, guys, I also did not sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| Give me just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3057)|
| 0:51:11| So I'm Stephanie Saldano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| I live at 3805 Valley View Drive right next to Jessica,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| and I also own the extending back acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Well, my family owns the extending back acre and the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| We currently have foundational issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| and there's two city basins that run connecting to her yard and our neighbor's yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| and then right next to it, an open channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| What I didn't know about this property when I bought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| was that Little Springs is built atop springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| and after 40, 50 years, the way that they've done the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| they're starting to collapse, make caves, sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| I already have one in my yard and one that was fixed two years ago in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| Again, my home is in serious need of foundation work, and I'm about to start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| I finally got contact with the city and the county about those basins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| and how they do the engineering for the stormwater and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| and I have to start working my home before they can do the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| for that whole side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| So everybody's house already receives water and flooding every time it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| My house personally gets the river or the runback from the street right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| because of all the backflow and the lack of maintenance of that whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| So my concern, aside from noise and privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| is the fact that if you do anything groundbreaking in any surrounding areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| it could make more sinkholes and also create more downhill problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| for everybody that lives on that side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| because, again, my house is already currently flooding in every rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| And it's because of those city basins that the stormwater engineers of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| they're supposed to maintain them, but it's been years since they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| And, you know, a lot of those homes are old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| So I think that starting an uphill property establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| that's beyond what we already have is also, again, without a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| definitely a no on my vote and the vote of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3205)|
| 0:53:44| Hello. My name is Blake Stapleton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| I live at 3303 Gary Road, which is one minute down the street from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| I also have access to use the 22.95 acres that are attached to the back of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| and I use it for outdoor activities and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| My main concern with any development along that ridge is the impact it will have on wildlife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| as well as increased traffic, noise, and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| and apartment buildings and things like that invite crime to the area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| I just moved from Barton Street, which is just five minutes down closer to Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| I moved over to this area to get away from the homeless people, the drugs, and the crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| and I don't want that coming back this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| So I'm totally against any development anywhere near that ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| We are not building any apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| What we plan to build on there is maybe three units of six, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| three buildings of six duplexes, single story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| When we build, we plan to, I guess, build the French drains for proper water flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| and everything to keep everything where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| RN2 provides 10,000 square feet for each building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3314)|
| 0:55:22| so that's plenty of landscape area for the water to be consumed by the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| And we don't plan to actually remove any of the trees in the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| We only plan to use what's actually available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| That front side, it's about, give or take, 300 feet from the street to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3342)|
| 0:55:52| We might remove a little bit in the front just to be able to build that third duplex, but nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3352)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I think the staff's recommendation is accurate and correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| and I would make a motion to approve RN2 single family residential neighborhood per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| And Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Quick question to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| So RN2, does that work with your request because the original request was RN4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Yes, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| We got plenty of space in the property line and it meets what's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Oh, no, we have a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Ms. Porsche?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| So the RN2 zone only allows one primary structure on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| so you would have to subdivide to put an additional structure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| You've got 100 foot of road frontage, so you'd only be able to add one extra lot under RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| I just wanted to be sure that you were aware you'd only be able to do two primary structures on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I'm sorry, I couldn't hear most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| So go ahead, Ms. Porsche, if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| I'm seeing my colleagues disagree with me, so maybe I'll let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| So, as Ms. Porsche mentioned, your lot frontage could potentially limit your number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| If you're in the RN2 zone, if you want to build a duplex, you do need 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| and there is a minimum lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| I believe it's 50 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| In order to build more than two duplexes, you would need to provide a different type of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| like a shared permanent access easement or something onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| As she mentioned, you'd have to replot the property as well to create the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| but there could be a potential for more than just two if you create alternative access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| What we plan to do is build a driveway on the right side of it to access the back units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| and maybe that will cut us maybe 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| That will give us about 80 feet for that initial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| I think we could work with that, manage a good set of house plans to build on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| Mr. Hernandez, I just want to clarify, are you requesting RN4 or RN2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| I requested initially RN4, but we could work with RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Mr. Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| I just want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| So under RN2, theoretically they would only be able to do two duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3533)|
| 0:59:04| Try this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| They could do an access easement and not have the road frontage on the initial two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| assuming that the lot's definitely deep enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| So, yeah, I'm sorry for the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| And that would require replatting into three different parcels to do more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| or to do three if that's their goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Are you familiar with the plotting process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Do you have a surveyor working on this project already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| To subdivide the lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Yeah, we wanted to avoid that because it's a long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| and if we have to, we'll go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Does RN3 allow for more than one principal use structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| With that, I would really recommend that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I don't know if we can actually go with a different zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| but I think that RN3 would be a lot more appropriate for just the practicality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| of actually accomplishing any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Which RN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| It would be one up from RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| and it would allow them to not have to go through a potentially very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| process to subdivide this into multiple parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| So, you know, if the current motion were to fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| and if it were allowed I would make that recommendation or that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| So, Mr. Hernandez, are you okay requesting RN3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| So we have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| and we probably need to ask our motion person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| which is Commissioner Phillips, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| if he would be willing to amend his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Chairman Hill, if I could just ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| And this is a staff question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| In RN2, are you building one-story or two-story buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| One-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| It should be fine then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Because you can't, if I understand RN3 right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| they have to be one level and they can't be a townhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Is that correct in RN3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| RN3 does allow townhomes in addition to duplex and single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| with a maximum height of 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Question one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| I think it would be good to hear why planning staff might not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| suggested RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| And question two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| if we are to move ahead with a motion that's considering RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| how is that not spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Those are good questions, and we'll go to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| So RN3 can be considered within the sector plan land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| classification, so it would not be spot zoning for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| We recommended RN2 to be more consistent with the existing residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| form along Valley View Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| which is fairly large lots that are single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| So Commissioner Phillips has made a motion for RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| Correct, Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| And we have a second by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| And I see no other light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| So all in favor for RN2, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3759)|

| 1:02:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| It looks like we've got three, four nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3763)|

| 1:05:40| Staff recommendation is to approve the request for the nightclub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| with approximately 3,000 square feet of floor area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| in the CH-1 Highway Commercial zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| subject to the five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3956)|

| 1:06:01| Peter Dodsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| And what is your address, Mr. Dodsey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| 2553 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| Would you like to go first, Mr. Dodsey, or would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Ladies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Ladies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| My name is Kelly Thompson, and I represent 2562 Western, an RNK LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| They operate a distribution facility, which is across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| and on the corner from the proposed nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| They purchased this property in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| and operated a distribution facility there during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| With the change of Western Avenue at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| TDOT took part of the front of 2562's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| and put the lot directly there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and created some additional parking for our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| which is across the street from this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| And our concerns are a nightclub is, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| sticks out in terms of everything else that's around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| It's a wide industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Our facility operates during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| They don't have a fence, security, a gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| and they feel like allowing a nightclub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| with the special use exception to allow a nightclub to operate there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| could increase potential for theft and vandalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| and additional people coming over and using our parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| The proposed location, there's less than 25 parking spaces at that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| and so that's why we oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| That was very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Can I go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| I'm so glad I see Mr. Logan over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| You're welcome to the panel anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Well, Your Honor, I think this proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| is not going to affect that property across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| because let's take a look at the property one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| The property is on this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| and my neighbor's property is kind of far away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| And the kind of nightclub we are going to put over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| is not a nightclub per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It's like an African setting where the African comes around once in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| come up, we all sit down and enjoy ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| It's not like we're going to have an overflow of people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| It's just to get our African culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| on where we can enjoy ourselves every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Yes, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Sometimes we go to other nightclubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| The way the party and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| it's a little bit different from what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| So we want to enjoy the taste of Africa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| so we're bringing it closer to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| It's not like a huge traffic of people all over the street, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| I would love that you can vote and approve that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| I would really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| I have a question about what happens with the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| If for some reason this club special use went away after a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| does the special use persist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| or does a new owner then come back and ask for the special use again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| Someone else could come and buy his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| and operate it exactly how he had presented it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Yes, and that would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| It wouldn't vary by ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| unless they were wanting to do something different than a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Okay, so nightclub owner A can leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| and then nightclub owner B can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| and there's no special use seen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| But as long as it's a nightclub, it will persist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| And it meets all the conditions approved by this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| If they expand, would it have to go back to special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Move to approve the special use of a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| So seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| Seeing we have a like Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| I just want to comment because I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| And just to clarify any potential concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| my firm in an earlier where we changed our company name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| had done the original architecture for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| We have not been retained in any way for this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| And so I feel no need to accuse myself or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| We'll accept that disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Seeing we have a Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| I want to go back to Commissioner Adams' question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| because I understand why it was entered the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| But what he proposed was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| even though it falls under the classification of nightclub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| what he proposed is not necessarily as intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| as what we might consider a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| So you're saying that what he's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| which is something a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| because what he stated just now about what their intent of using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| yes, it technically falls under the nightclub code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| but it's less intensive than, say, a traditional nightclub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| that may have loud parties, lots of overflow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| which is the question that Commissioner Adams was asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| because Operator B could come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| and it could be a more traditional nightclub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| compared to what they might be operating initially, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| But, I mean, we have noise ordinances and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| Okay, seeing no other likes, all in favor to approve, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| All right, did I get to go to 20 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| Agenda item 20, applicant, commercial site design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4351)|

| 1:12:48| Staff recommendation is to approve the proposed drive-through facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| for a restaurant subject to the noted eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4377)|

| 1:13:02| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Okay, if you'll state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| and then if you want to proceed or you can defer to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4387)|

| 1:13:24| Go ahead, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4404)|

| 1:13:43| I wrote down what I wanted to say so I wouldn't get off track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| There are so many fast food places on Broadway within a very tight region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4428)|
| 1:13:57| Located near the spot where this cookout restaurant would be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| are already a KFC, a Wendy's, a McDonald's, a Burger King, a Subway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| a Taco Bell, a Crystal, a Sonic, and I'm sure I'm leaving something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| Living in our neighborhood, we smell grease in the air on hot days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| We constantly pick up trash from fast food places off our lawns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| and we wake up most nights to the sound of dumpsters being dumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| I'm sure that some of these restaurants have something to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| with the significant local rodent population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| And, of course, there's also the traffic issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| which a lot of the public commentary focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| It's already so busy on the western end of Edgewood that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| which is the Broadway end, that a lot of the families on that end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| who have little kids have placed big, tall fences up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| to keep their children safe from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| And I think that another piece of this that hasn't been raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| in the public comments, which I would like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| because I live on Claiborne Place, which is the only egress for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| If traffic is tied up on Edgewood for any number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Claiborne Place becomes the next outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| And Claiborne Place is just a little tiny street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| It was built before any of the houses on that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| had indoor plumbing, let alone cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| And the city allows parking on both sides of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| and so when there's two cars coming in opposite directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| it gets really crowded really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| And there are, I've seen fistfights on that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| with people getting out of their cars to scream at each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| about who's got the right of way and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| So the idea of increasing the congestion on Edgewood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| in ways that might bring more traffic to Claiborne Place is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| you know, it's not good, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| And I think a lot of people would agree with me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| the city's general lack of vision for much of Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| has resulted in a depressing several-mile stretch of check-cashing places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| and title loan offices and lots of fast food restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| Meanwhile, there are lovely small businesses of all kinds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| very necessary ones, laundromats and places to get your breaks worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| grocery stores, gyms, record stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| And, you know, big national chains who don't care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| don't have to care actually about Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| and the people who live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| I really, in my opinion, that's not the way to redevelop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| the neglected and empty properties on that stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| So thank you very much for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4599)|
| 1:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| My name is Michael Hicks, representing Cookout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| Along with me today also is Daniel Moore with Wolf and McClure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| As our team, we're the civil engineer of record, our team is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| and we've been working with staff on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| We appreciate staff and their feedback that they've given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| to this project on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| And we're amenable to all the conditions that have been listed by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| to incorporate into our design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| which would actually bring down the parking than what we've previously proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| We are adding generous amounts of landscaping and privacy fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| as part of this project as well, incorporating, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| actually stormwater management, and I wanted to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| This site does have a lot of encumbrances on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| We've worked really diligently here to not have the building within the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| So we've, you know, got that on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Also, we've reduced impervious to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| and we're incorporating stormwater management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| both water quality and piping detention with our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| So all that kind of summed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| We're really excited about bringing this project to the community here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4706)|
| 1:18:33| and, you know, be open for any questions you may have specific further on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Yeah, I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| I think that this is a pretty good site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| and a good example of CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| and adhering to the Build 2 zone lines that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| The site plan accommodates the pedestrian intent of that code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| by adding that patio that I know has been worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| So I think this is a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| and I'd like to go ahead and make a motion to approve the drive-through facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| special use subject to the conditions and staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Okay, so we had a motion by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| or Schelso, Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| seconded by Commissioner Barger to approve her staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| I was getting some clarification here on the Build 2 line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| We still have some lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Yeah, I wanted to say I mostly agree with Commissioner Schelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| and do think that the staff have worked out the best solution that they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| and I appreciate the applicant's collaboration with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| I just can't support this because of the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| and its connection to the residential neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| So it's not a critique of the work that staff has done or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| I just wanted to articulate that's why we'll be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| All right, seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4832)|
| 1:20:41| Item 26, the applicant, Roy Anderson and Steven Padgett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Location, southeast side of Raccoon Valley Drive, east of Raccoon Woods Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| Approximate size of track, 12.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Present zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| Zoning requested, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| Density proposed, five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| And the staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| with up to three and a half dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| because it is consistent with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| and the surrounding development subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| You'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Steven Padgett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| My address is 211 Stonebreeze Drive, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| We intend to do some townhomes here on about 12 acres of the 16.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| And so in order to do the development and do the townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| five per acre really is kind of a break even that we need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| If we leave the four and a half acres up on the top of the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| because it goes up the ridge to the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| if we leave that forested and just put some walk paths up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| could we do five on the 12 below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| So basically go above the 3.5 in the 12 that we develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| and leave the 4 above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| I'm sorry, 12 and 4.5 above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| We might not even be able to get 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| We might have to only do 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| It depends on the cost analysis of the rock and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| There's a lot of big rock in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Ms. Poche, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| I think that was in form of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| I guess are you asking for us to increase it to five based on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| that you wouldn't be disturbing the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| I was in my pre-meeting with the lady from the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| I was told a word clustering was the word that was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| that there may be permission to cluster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| so go above 3.5 on the flat land we want to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| if we don't develop other land on that strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| that overall 16.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| The PR zone allows clustering just naturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| It's not something that you would need to seek permission for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I guess the recommendation from me, from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| is to leave that undisturbed area and then put 3.5 on the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| understanding that undeveloped section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| the density that would be allowed there would be added to that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| You'd get 3.5 over the whole property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| even though what you only develop would yield a higher result than the five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| So our recommendation is the 3.5 overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| So I think you're, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| making your case for why you would need the five over the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| I'm deaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Sorry, I'm trying to read you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Were you saying we could take those others and put it in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| on the area we were developing if we left that undeveloped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| So the PR zone just inherently allows you to cluster the lots in the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| so that you would leave that part undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| So if the total property is, we have it noted, I think it's 12.5, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| So if you get 3.5 over the 12.5 dwelling unit, I'm sorry, acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| whatever that gets, whatever that number is, it yields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| you get to put that many houses or lots on the flat property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| If that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| I'll make a motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Barger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| I guess I just was looking for a clarification on the density as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| just to make sure that we got you covered here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| So the total, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Porsche,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| the total amount of acreage is 16.5, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| I just had it surveyed, and that's when it came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| So I'm not sure if it's not been updated yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| So that's what I'm going off of is the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Whatever the case is, that section that goes up the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| we're not developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| So even if it scales smaller, the same question applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Can we take the section that we're not developing and use those instead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| I follow what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| but do you know roughly how many units you're trying to develop on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| property now total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Assuming that I can do nine acres behind and three acres up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| which is what I'm planning, I would see under 56, so 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| It would be about 1,600 square foot townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| not stacked with garages in between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| About three per section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| So you're looking at a total of about 56 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| So I guess I just want to be clear with the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| and how the staff's got it written up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| that the 3.5 units is over the entire 16.5 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| not the 12.5 that's referenced a couple of times in the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| The number that we use is based off of KGIS data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| It's not based off of a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| So if he's got something that says 16 feet and it's the entire parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| then that would be the correct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| So we've not excluded anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| We've not excluded the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| It's just a function of the KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| I just wanted to make it clear that he can have up to 56 or so units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5206)|

| 1:35:46| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| My name is Daniel Wilkins at 1928 Hickory Glen Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| I live in the cul-de-sac that this portion backs up into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| So my lot is lot 10, which is actually across the street from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5769)|
| 1:36:15| the cul-de-sac up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| There are the houses that do abut the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| Three of the residents there are out of town that wanted to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| here, and they were very vocal and involved in the last attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| to develop this property but were independently out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| and unable to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| So I have three children all in the Hardin Valley school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| Next year they will be the 8th, 10th, and 12th grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| and they've all grown up through the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| I'm intimately aware and familiar with that stretch of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| and also the property behind our subdivision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| I have three concerns that I wanted to raise today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| Number one is about the traffic, and it's not the volume of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| traffic that will be added to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| I'm aware that engineering designs have said that the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| can handle more volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| My concern is the location of the entrance and exits of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| two, the prior development and this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| directly across from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| So we have 55 units right here, and if you look at where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| entrance to the high school is and then further down is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| the elementary school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| And so we have 55 units coming in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| 60 units in the prior development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| just feet down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| And so my concern is the volume of entrance and exits directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| across from the school system, particularly since this unit will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| be within the walking zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| All these units will be within the walking zone to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| All three of my kids have been walking to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| So that's the concern I wanted to raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| There is one pedestrian crossing further down toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| elementary school, or at the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| but further down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| This would absolutely require at least one or more pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| crossings, which is in the plan, but I just wanted to raise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| importance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| If you travel down Cedar Bluff Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| and you can see the number of crossings that they put across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| the schools there, we're approaching that need here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| I do not think there's a need to impede traffic generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| because I think that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| But certainly there's a need for more pedestrian crossings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| particularly if we have 120 more units entering those two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| of land right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Secondly, I just wanted to raise the issue of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Their proposal states that there's going to be 7.2 acres that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| would be disturbed in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| And as a – I just would like for you all to consider that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| hillside protection policy is there not to be ignored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| and would ask that you all recognize the desire to minimize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| the infraction on the hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Third, and really this is the one that I would like for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| to consider most, is the impact on the existing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| around this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| So our subdivision is up on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| And so all of these houses look down on what's now a field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| but will be these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| And there is provided in the plan, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| a 30 to 35-foot buffer zone, which if you were to step off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| that amount, it really isn't that great of a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| What I would request, particularly since the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| development plan, you know, policy is not to impact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| existing neighborhoods and communities and to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| it says, deeper setbacks, wider lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| and landscape buffers shall be provided where new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| abuts lower-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| So this property is abutting lower-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| And so especially since we are up on the hill looking down on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| this development with their units will have a maximum height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| of 35 feet, we would request a motion to require extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| buffer zone and a requirement for tall vegetative buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| within that zone to separate the lower-density housing from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| higher-density housing that we are going to be looking down on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| not metaphorically, but physically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| So those are the three concerns I would like for you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| consider as you listen to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Mr. Wilkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I will do my best to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| I guess as far as the pedestrian crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| I don't disagree that one is probably needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| but this is a bad location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| Typically mid-block crossings are frowned upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| I know there is one closer to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| But I think, you know, there may be an opportunity somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| closer to the entrance to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| but this is a bad location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| It's coming out of a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| And, you know, I don't know if that's in the school zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| but if it's not, then I would certainly recommend that if one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| is installed, that it's installed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| definitely well within the school zone where vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| have slowed, theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| As far as the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| I thought we were pretty responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| In our design, you know, there was an initial proposal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| single-family lots, you know, larger single-family lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| and we chose to cluster the development just for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| and to limit grading costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| So I can't remember one site of this and the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| One of them had 70% open space reserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| and the other one was 77 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| They're pretty high numbers, so I'm not really sure what else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| we can do in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| But with that, I'll answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| I'll attempt to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| So I see that there's a traffic impact study that got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| Director Snowden, have you guys had a chance to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| and opine on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| We have, and we concurred with the recommendations of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| traffic engineer, Mr. Jacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Could you repeat your answer about how you would handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| the landscape buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| We're leaving a large percentage of the existing vegetation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| How does that equate to the opposition's concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| specifically 35 feet to expanded buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| I don't know how far we are from our limits of disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| but it's a long ways from where he lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| Do you know how deep those lots are, by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| These lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| I think they're 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Okay, so you've got 120 on one side and 120 for 240,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| and then 50 feet for the roadway, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| I mean, you're less than 300 feet total from one side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| property line to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| On KGIS, the only reason I'm bringing this up is I just scaled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| it on KGIS, and the property's over 800 feet wide in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| So you're maybe 400 feet of buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| Mr. Snowden, what would be the process of a new pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| crossing near a school in terms of getting a new one implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| You know, this location, it is in a horizontal curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| so sight distance is not the most ideal situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| We did install a crossing there at the location that is highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6289)|
| 1:44:57| on the screen there just west of that second high school entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| That location is inside the reduced-speed school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| We also installed activated flashers for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| and as you can see the roadway is in a very straight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| good sight distance location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I would be very leery of installing an at-grade crossing at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| location throughout this curve just because of the fact that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| outside the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| It has limited visibility, so it would be something I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| some concerns about installing a pedestrian crossing at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| What if it were a little further, and just looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| when you zoom out at the school, you know, that current crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| definitely would collect anyone walking from the west, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| But when you go east, you know, would there be a potential for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| on the other side of that school access right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| I guess what would be the process of putting that in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Is that neighborhood-driven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| Yeah, I mean, I think the school speed limit's reduction signs near that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| where you can kind of see that new construction there to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| I mean, I think if there was to be a new crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| we would want to see activated flashers on it, as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| signage and appropriate markings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| So, I mean, I think that would be the location, if you wanted to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| another one that would be a little closer, would be the optimal spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| rather than the one in front of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6389)|

| 1:49:52| My biggest request currently is to see as much of the natural beauty of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6596)|

| 1:50:12| From the front of my house to the back of my house, we see trees upon trees upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| We sit in our backyard most evenings enjoying the wildlife that lives in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| trees while enjoying the beauty of the countryside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| There are some beautiful huge oak trees on that property that I would hate to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6627)|

| 1:50:44| To lose this would be devastating to us emotionally, and it will indeed reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6644)|

| 1:51:31| This plan that we're looking at is different than what it was when I signed up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6691)|
| 1:51:37| oppose for it, and I'm much more happy to see what I see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6697)|
| 1:51:45| I'm sorry about the feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| I have a lot less concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| There were going to be homes, backyards up against my house before, so I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| happy to see this, but there is a lot of natural area that's remaining to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| right of all the dwellings, and that's my biggest concern is what's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| done in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| After speaking to the contractor and the developer, I do feel confident that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| concerns are going to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| They have mentioned that they will be trying to leave as much of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| flushed as possible and move the pond as far in towards development as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| I appreciate this very, very much, but I did want to come out and be heard today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| so my concerns were on record because there's a lot of area there, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| know exactly what their plan is to do with it, and I'm just really hoping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| they keep it as natural as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| I think we have one other in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| Mr. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| I'm Sherry Roop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| I live at 7600 Old Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| My property on this map would be above the development, and we actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| two dwellings and a business on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Beyond our house is a creek, and we do have flooding, of course, in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| So, again, my concern is proper care of any runoff that will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| The property is basically rock, which is, they'll tell you one reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| their plan changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| So where the buildings are being built is basically the non-rock area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| which would have been the area that would have absorbed water before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| So now that's being covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| So, again, I'm concerned it's going to add to the water flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| I was at a meeting this morning, very happy with their comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| about possible changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| My concern is that the detention pond area is also just rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| So I'm not a contractor, but I would think they'd have to bring in some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| of permeable dirt or something to absorb the water that comes off of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| And I just want to be sure that it's adequate for the water that's coming off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| To the northeast of my property is a development of condos that was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| approximately 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| There essentially is no detention pond for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| And the front part of my property, which I accepted was in a flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| because there's a creek down there, the flooding area has gotten closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| to my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| So I feel like we're kind of being used as a catch basin for that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| and I don't want to see that happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| I'm also happy to see more trees left on the property, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| was very happy to discuss all that with the developer this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| Yes, we met this morning and walked the site with the neighbors here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| and looked at the trees, and we felt like we could move the pond out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| and preserve a lot more of the vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| This plan that we had here with the rock that was present on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| it just couldn't be done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| And so our plan is to go locate the rock features, the rock outcroppings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| locate the trees, especially the larger ones, and to design around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| and come up with, as we know, this is just a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| Our next step will be to do the design plan, which will include the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| And so we're going to look at minimizing the disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| because the more we disturb, the more it's going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| the more impact it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| And so the more trees you cut, that's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| So our goal is to save as much of the vegetation as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| and, of course, to avoid the rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| and come up with a stormwater plan that works and won't be impacts downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| So we just ask for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| I just want to verify that, because in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| it's got both the old plan with 16 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| but what we're talking about is really page 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| which shows kind of the newer design that shows everything kind of up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| closer to Emory Road, leaving most of that vegetation in the back, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| That's kind of what's before us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| Because page 4 showed a different layout of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7005)|
| 1:56:54| Page 4 is from an old concept, and so those lots got addresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| but it was never developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Okay, just want to double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Then with that, I would make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Let me get back over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| Approve the requested variance and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| based on the justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| and recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| We have a motion to approve the variance and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| based on justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| and recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| Is that correct, Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| And seeing no other, Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| Will the development plan come back to us, the final development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| No, this is the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| I just wanted to say we, I guess maybe pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| but a lot of times we talk about wishing that the developers and the neighbors would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7080)|
| 1:58:07| you know, hoping that they would communicate with one another more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| and I think that this is a really good example of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| with you all going out on the site together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| and trying to work with the neighbors' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| I just want to thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| and hope that that continues to be the case, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| that relationship and those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Maybe sooner might have helped a little bit with some of the communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| but I think it's really great that you all were able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7131)|

| 1:58:58| and that would be seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| Seeing Mr. Higgins, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7145)|

| 1:59:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| With that, I'll make a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| for up to 12 detached dwelling units on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7156)|

| 1:59:46| Location, south side of Middlebrook Park, east of Countryside Center Lane, west of Durham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| Approximate size of track, 11.04 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Zoning plan residential, up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7197)|

| 2:00:05| Proposed use, 128-unit multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Staff recommendation is to approve the development plan for a 128-unit multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7209)|
| 2:00:17| subject to the noted eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| The applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| Daniel Levy, 3523 Maloney Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Levy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| I'll defer to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7231)|
| 2:00:52| Jeff Wright, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7252)|
| 2:01:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| 1243 Hearthstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| I'd like to say that I didn't think that this property was appropriate for apartments being so close to subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7272)|
| 2:01:26| based on the density of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| I understand we have apartments in between, I mean on the other side of the proposed area there to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| but that's not near as dense as adding some more in there between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| As you can see, my property is at the cul-de-sac right there to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7303)|
| 2:01:56| Anyway, so the proposed plan is going to put parking and one apartment right behind my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7316)|
| 2:02:09| The parking lot setback proposed is 15 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7329)|
| 2:02:18| The closest distance from the corner of my house to my property line is 27 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| 15 feet is not much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| We're right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| If you just put some evergreens there, it's not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| I mean, I'm going to have noise of cars, doors, people talking and stuff 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7354)|
| 2:02:46| Obviously, I didn't purchase the property if I'd have known that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| Personally, and I don't expect nobody to answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| but I don't think that any of us here would do that knowingly if we knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| It's going to place an undue burden on my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| Also, we have young kids next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| They're toddlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| I just think that's going to be a safety concern for my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| But the noise and nuisance is the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| Personally, my wife, she has a problem with insomnia and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| I'll tell you, that much that close in my back door is definitely going to be a problem for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7408)|
| 2:03:36| It's going to cause a health concern and a quality of life for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| So I would ask that we take another look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| I don't think that people really get the gravity of 15 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| and what some evergreens are going to do to help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| I do appreciate that I got to talk to Daniel this morning before I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| It's the first conversations that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| And I'm sure we could have some more conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| but I would expect that maybe we look at doing some other things first before we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7450)|
| 2:04:17| That's all I've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| I'd like to reserve some of my time for rebuttal if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| Thanks, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| Jeff and I had a very good conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7473)|
| 2:04:40| There may be some opportunity close to his parcel to look at different buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| And currently what's being proposed in the landscape plan is an evergreen buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| We talked a little bit about maybe a small wall that could help with some lighting or additional protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7491)|
| 2:04:59| or maybe even look for opportunities to move about eight or so of those spaces further away from his particular home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7499)|
| 2:05:07| So we're looking for a win-win there and an opportunity to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| And so I enjoyed our conversation this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| I also wanted to thank Whitney for all her help working on this project with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| It's a very tight and challenging site with the different topography changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| And we went through with the scenic highway overlay just some interpretation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| So I really appreciate the correspondence we had together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| And then just wanted to highlight the hilltop protection areas that we're trying to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| and why some of the buildings are located where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| We're trying to keep the buildings, the new buildings, where the existing grading has already occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| which is kind of in that knuckle of the site where our buildings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| And so we're leaving all the existing vegetation towards the back of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| and on the frontage of Middlebrook where the overlay is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| So that's some of the justification for the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| And we aren't fully maximizing the unit density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| It could be up to 135 units, and so we're slightly under that at 128.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| But I think Jeff said he wanted to have a few more comments, so I'll let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| So if you could leave that picture up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| As you look at the picture there where that building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7588)|
| 2:06:36| just that property right there in that pie shape that goes back to the corner, that's my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| As you can see, they're going to put the one apartment building in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| that's going to come down about halfway through my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| and then along the front is going to be a parking lot drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| So I can appreciate trying to remove some of those parking spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7616)|
| 2:07:02| but still the traffic is going to have to go back and forth through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| And I saw the plan before this plan that didn't have that parking lot area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7626)|
| 2:07:14| that was less intrusive than this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| So it's the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| It's the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| I mean, what can I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| It's the noise, and I didn't pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| And I feel like, you know, I could put a for sale sign in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| but any good realtor is going to go, this is what's planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| and I'm going to have to deal with those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| and trying to sell my house and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| it's going to make it less attractable to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| So I would ask that maybe we go back to the drawing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| we can work together, and then we come back before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| Because you're my only protection at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| And I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| This is more for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| So I'm looking at TCA 54-17-115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| Considering there was existing grading already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| who owned the property when that existing grading was done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| Because I want to make sure that they're not trying to skirt the intent of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| by having the grading done, transferring the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| so that they can build a taller building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| because now the grading is below the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| which would allow for basically an assertion of what the Scenic Highway Act meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| The site is still above the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| Okay, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7724)|
| 2:08:56| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| Mr. Levy, could a wall be built between the two property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| between the parking and the individual's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| all the way down through there to kind of give a little more separation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| Yeah, a landscape wall, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| and we could work with Jeff to look at materials and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| and that would be appropriate if that's the preference versus a screen buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| or like a type B buffer that was recommended by the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| Is there room enough to do both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| I think the size of the root,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| that would be a question for my landscape architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| but I would assume the size of the root balls may be interfered with by the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| so I think it would probably be smaller shrubs would be my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| what I would anticipate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| Yeah, I mean, I think a wall would probably be as appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| given the proximity to his property and other properties in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| the whole section there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| I think a wall would probably be more appropriate if it were done in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| attractive, steady way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| And you're anticipating a wall, like a head for parking lot lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| you know, three, four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Yeah, at least four or five feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| I don't know, staff, if we can be more specific on how the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| and the height and location of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7828)|
| 2:10:37| I will add that, too, as a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| a motion to approve the developed plan per staff's recommendation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| addition of item number nine, an appropriate buffer wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7846)|
| 2:10:55| for lack of better words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| It's green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| Commissioner Phillips, so on the condition two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| currently there's called for a vegetative buffer, type B buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| so would it be in lieu of that, or would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| I would like it to be in addition, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7868)|
| 2:11:19| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| Can you restate that condition, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| To add item number nine, an appropriate physical screen, a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7891)|
| 2:11:43| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| In addition to the buffer identified in condition two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| In that same location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7912)|
| 2:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| I know on other projects we've done a parking lot screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| approved wood fencing, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| so that's what you have in mind when you say wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Unfortunately, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| we can't get specifics on what it would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| but I trust that staff can work with you to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| that's workable for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| So we're adding a condition for a screening wall on the border?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| And maybe, I mean, not just affecting this individual's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| but others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| They're all pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| I will indicate that on the other property lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| the project is lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| and there's already a landscape segment of retaining wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| and so you wouldn't, like, the parking lot's already concealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| Steve, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| Commissioner Browning gave me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| So this is our, I mean, specifically our neighbor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| His home is about 12 feet up from that parking lot, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| So I don't know what a wall would really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| That's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| I mean, I don't think a wall would be all effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| I want to echo a little bit of what Commissioner Schelso was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| because, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| I was looking at some of the others that are overlooking the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| and it's in the district, the scenic highway district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| which maxes out at 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| Correct, Commissioner Horner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| So the average height of the building maxes out at 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| where those, most of them in that cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| the topography's running down, but a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| as Commissioner Schelso said, are more than 35 feet above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| so they'd actually be looking at the roof line of the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| buildings down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| So I don't have any problem with that, with the retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| and being set below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| I do see the issue on the back portion of it, where it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| it is still elevated, but it's not elevated as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| So I guess I just, for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| just would maybe want to say that fence or that wall would just be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| that back section of the parking lot, not necessarily all the way around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| because it gets very redundant at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8082)|
| 2:14:55| Okay, so we have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| and we added that condition of a screening wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| We've got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Seeing no other lines, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8116)|

| 2:16:45| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| My name is Brenda Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| I represent Seth Downing, and Mr. Downing is here in the lilac shirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| and Brooke Downing is with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| And I may defer a minute or two of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| if he wants to make some additional comments over and above what I state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| My address is 6223 Highland Place Way, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| Mr. Downing's address is 7201 Ball Camp Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8232)|
| 2:17:19| He shares a common boundary with the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| and I sent a letter to the commission yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| and thank you all for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| I sent a letter yesterday afternoon with some attachments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| and the letter requests a postponement to require Mr. Bozat, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8256)|
| 2:17:45| to do a wetlands delineation on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| And if we go back to the site map that was planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| if you look about the middle of the bottom of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| you can barely see there's just a very slight drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8280)|
| 2:18:09| and you really can't even pick it up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| where there is a wetlands designated on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8293)|
| 2:18:19| It's very faint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| And if you look at the drawing of that last parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| with that last building on the left-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| that wetlands designation and that turnaround for that parking lot are so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8311)|
| 2:18:38| that if there are any alterations because Mr. Reynolds was telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8318)|
| 2:18:44| that there may need to be some alterations to that turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| because of emergency equipment requirements that could cut into the barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8327)|
| 2:18:54| that is required by state and federal law for the wetlands area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| There's a 25-foot mandatory barrier, a 25-foot barrier that can be altered some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8339)|
| 2:19:06| but those lines are so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| And the reason that we want a delineation is I don't know where the map came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8348)|
| 2:19:16| that delineates the wetlands area on this map that we're looking at on the big screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8356)|
| 2:19:24| I don't know who drew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| And if that delineation is any larger or if the configuration is any different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8366)|
| 2:19:32| that is going to dramatically impact how that turnaround can be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8372)|
| 2:19:40| and still meet code requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| We need a delineation because that wetland exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| And my client is even more concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8389)|
| 2:19:58| and attached to my package is a letter from the TDAC to Mr. Bodezat, October 22nd of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8398)|
| 2:20:12| And that letter is to advise him of a violation, unauthorized stream alterations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8412)|
| 2:20:21| Mr. Bodezat, if you look at the satellite image of this property, if you'll turn to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| go to the left where that large building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| I'm sorry, go the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| There is a church there, and Mr. Bodezat owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| So my client's property is immediately to the west of the church, right where that white roof is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8443)|
| 2:20:51| That is my client's garage, and that is his house, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| And so Mr. Bodezat received a notice from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| that he had violated stream alterations on the church property at 5050 Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8461)|
| 2:21:08| and that is in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| And so my point is we didn't have the oversight for him that I'm asking you to impose upon him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8471)|
| 2:21:22| So before we realized what was going on on the church property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| he had already altered wetlands and streams, and we don't want that to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| So I had asked for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| I've been in communication with Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| I've been in communication, talked to Mr. Snowden before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8500)|
| 2:21:46| And one solution that I can ask for and suggest perhaps is that as a condition to this approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8506)|
| 2:21:57| that we require Mr. Bodezat to do a wetlands delineation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| so we know exactly on this site plan what his parameters are on the property that he cannot disturb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8523)|
| 2:22:15| and that we also require him to do an aquatic resources alteration permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| that we require him to get that to make sure he does not have the same problems on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8541)|
| 2:22:28| that he had on the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| And this is what will protect my client, will protect the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| and basically make sure that we've got sufficient oversight so that we do not have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8558)|
| 2:22:48| Please wrap up, Councilor Brooks, if you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| And also in my attachment I've got a soil map that shows the property and that it's a very low-lying area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8571)|
| 2:22:59| I've got an aquatic study that shows that there's a hydraulic determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| and there is aquatic life that was on the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| There is on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| It needs to be EPA needs to have sufficient oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| And we're asking for these, our concerns to be addressed in approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8594)|
| 2:23:22| so that we have some sufficient oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8608)|
| 2:23:35| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| This application, the rezoning was before you in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| where this body recommended 10 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| After that zoning was recommended for approval here, they submitted their development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| which only required about 8.14 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| actually then reduced their recommendation to 8.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| to accommodate what we had actually proposed versus what we had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| We agree with staff's recommendation in the 10 conditions, including the landscaping buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| There's a type A, B, and C, depending on what boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| which should help mitigate any visual or noise impacts from this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| to the neighboring properties, and the height limitation as well is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| And we appreciate staff's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| A couple of neighborhood concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| I know there were some comments that were posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| I'll address those first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| There was concern about traffic on Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| This property doesn't access Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| Its entire access is a single entry there at the median break on Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8676)|
| 2:24:42| which is a minor arterial with 77 feet of pavement divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| No traffic impact analysis was required for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| There were some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| These are apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| These aren't apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| This is a mix between 30 duplex units and two single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| There was also a question, especially the zoning, about utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| and I believe Mr. Harbin submitted the utility service maps on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8703)|
| 2:25:11| but both KEBs confirmed that there's water and sewer available to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| so there's no issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| Regarding the specific concerns Ms. Brooks raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| we did have a wetlands delineation done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| That's Mr. Harbin when he laid out his site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| The wetlands delineation was done by GEOS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| and the area that's noted on that map is the area of the wetland determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| So we've already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| The wetlands issues, the ARAP, the issues of the EPA, those are state permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| that we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| That's really beyond the purview of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| We're looking at a development plan with the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| We have to get our permitting moving forward to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| We'll work with Knox County Engineering and with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| and the federal government if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| but right now for the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| that's really kind of beyond the scope of what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| I do need to take a bit of time, though, to address the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| On the website, the only thing that I saw posted from Mrs. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| was the 2020 letter about the violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| and I asked Mr. Bozad about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| and apparently they were bush hogging some property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| in the wetlands around the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| It got kind of sunk up, and they thought they could dig a ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| to kind of dry out the area so they can bush hog it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| and they got immediately got a notice of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| and, hey, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| You're actually affecting the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| You've got to get the permits, and they stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| which shows that there is a sufficient amount of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| even on the state level when you're dealing with this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| and that oversight will be present as we move forward on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| So, you know, I think we've talked about this at the zoning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| We've narrowed it down to the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| We've addressed it by allowing the property to be clustered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| and a slight reduction in the peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| to move it closer to Shod Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| and away from the environmentally sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| that are there to the south and the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| I think this is a good development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| It has staff's recommendation, and I'd ask that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| I just want to verify, Ben, what I heard you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| Even if we approve this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| you still have to get all of the permits for the wetland area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| and things to comply with all the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| whether it be state or federal for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| And it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| The ARAP I don't think would be required here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| unless we're getting into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| But if we do have to make some modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| like Ms. Brooks talked about in the conversation she had with Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| where we have to maybe potentially disturb some of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| we'd have to go and get the ARAP at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| And, again, that's a permitting process that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| beyond the decision today that we'd have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| So, Mr. Chairman, with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| and knowing that there is now neighborhood oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| that will report anything that if they violate that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| I would move that we approve the development plan for the multi-dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| with the attached and detached houses up to 32 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| and a reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| subject on the 10 conditions as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8892)|
| 2:28:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| We got it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| We have a motion to approve for staff recommendation by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8909)|

| 2:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| May I make one request, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| Ma'am, we've already voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| That moves us to I will entertain an honorary motion to adjourn by the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8926)|
| 2:28:55| that will put a punctuation on the ending of their terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| Hang on, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| Commission, we have our annual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8951)|
| 2:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8960)|
| 2:29:44| We are moving on to our annual meeting at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| And we will have the presentation of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Annual Report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| fiscal year 2023-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| And Ms. Allie Ketron will be addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| And along with Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| So we shared with you all earlier this week a draft of our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| And so we just wanted to take a few minutes to walk through the work that you all have completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| over the last year as well as some projects that our staff has been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| I know much of this is probably just reminders about work that you're already aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9022)|
| 2:30:29| But just worth taking a few minutes to recognize that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9029)|
| 2:30:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| So this is an overview of the cases that you all heard last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| I'm sure it's no surprise that you heard over 500 total cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| And this just shows that breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| This is pretty comparable to the previous year, though I think that total number was about 480.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| So up somewhat from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| And this is just a very brief snapshot of some of the development activity that occurred in our community last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| So it's broken into residential and non-residential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| We also shared with you all earlier this week the 2022 Development Activity Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| So that is a much broader look at that activity over the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9085)|
| 2:31:33| And we'll speak a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| This is just a very brief snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| And so we want to take a few minutes to talk about not just the tasks and workload that comes to us on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9098)|
| 2:31:45| but also some of the major projects that our staff have been working on in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| So breaking that down into the work of each of our divisions, looking at the Planning Services Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9111)|
| 2:31:58| You all are well aware of the missing middle housing scan that was completed last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9118)|
| 2:32:05| So our staff worked with the City of Knoxville and Optikos, a consultant group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9125)|
| 2:32:12| as well as the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors to complete that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9132)|
| 2:32:18| And now that it's out, the city is continuing their work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| looking at ways to identify areas where it's appropriate and really move that work forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| continuing work with partners and their leadership and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| You're also well aware of the Advanced Knox Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| Over the past year, there has been quite a bit of work that's gone into that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| so reaching out to the public and getting lots of input from our technical and advisory committees on work on things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9163)|
| 2:32:51| the preferred growth scenario and a future land use map and a list of prioritized transportation projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9171)|
| 2:32:59| And that work continues, and we anticipate that it will be wrapped up later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| So the project team is moving into the adoption process, so you'll be hearing more about that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9184)|
| 2:33:10| And then finally for this group, just a reminder of the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| So that was wrapped up last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| It came to this body and then was adopted by both city council and county commission afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| and just looking at that corridor and trying to identify areas for redevelopment there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| looking at opportunities for additional retail and commercial investment and housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| Moving on to our transportation group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| So they completed work on the 2023 to 2026 Transportation Improvement Program, or the TIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9219)|
| 2:33:48| So that is updated every four years, and it is a work program, a four-year work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9228)|
| 2:33:56| of federally funded and regionally significant and financially constrained transportation projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9236)|
| 2:34:02| So that was adopted by the TPO's executive board in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9242)|
| 2:34:08| They have also continued work on an ongoing pavement management project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9248)|
| 2:34:14| So they worked with applied pavement technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| and assessed pavement conditions for several participating member jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| And so those jurisdictions are now using that information to identify streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| that are most in need of repair and to develop multi-year maintenance rehab plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9269)|
| 2:34:35| that are going to be cost-effective in their maintenance for the region's roadway network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9275)|
| 2:34:42| They've also embarked on a regional roadway safety action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| So the TPO formed a task force with some local government partners and TDOT and BikeWalk Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9287)|
| 2:34:54| and they're looking through that project to identify changes that can be made in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9294)|
| 2:35:00| to save lives and to prevent serious injuries on our roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| So they anticipate that they'll have that plan in place later this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| and once they do, it'll position local governments and the TPO to apply for federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| And just worth a mention, the TPO's continued work on the Smart Trips Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9315)|
| 2:35:21| So participants in that program last year made about 37,000 fewer car trips by making alternative choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9321)|
| 2:35:29| So biking and walking and riding the bus and making an impact on our roadways and our air quality that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9329)|
| 2:35:37| And then looking at our information services group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| so quite a few things have happened within that group over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| Responding to requests by lots of users, a transportation impact study layer was added to our case viewer map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9345)|
| 2:35:54| So that allows users to go in and filter their search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9354)|
| 2:36:00| and it shows active and archived cases that have a traffic study associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9360)|
| 2:36:08| We also continued work on our technical report series, so we've brought those to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| But just a reminder that we wrapped up a tech report on the center of population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| So looking at the underlying social and economic drivers of that shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| and also the priority population technical report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| So looking at neighborhoods in the area that are most challenged by daily stressors and inequities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9392)|
| 2:36:40| I also want to mention the website support that this group provides for lots of local partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9400)|
| 2:36:46| So providing content and maintenance and design work for websites for lots of local partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9406)|
| 2:36:54| It includes the Knoxville Chamber, the Industrial Development Board, the Advanced Knox Project, the TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9414)|
| 2:37:02| and also did some work for the Tennessee Chapter of the American Planning Association for their 2022 fall conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9422)|
| 2:37:10| And just also want to talk about the fact that over the past several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| we have produced lots of really great interactive tools that live on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9434)|
| 2:37:22| and that we try to keep maintained and up to date to share the data that we have access to with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9442)|
| 2:37:30| and other elected and appointed officials and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9450)|
| 2:37:35| So last year, data updates were made to Panorama and also to the American Community Survey Explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9455)|
| 2:37:43| That group also added a new dashboard to Panorama showing the area's priority populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230608?start=9463)|
