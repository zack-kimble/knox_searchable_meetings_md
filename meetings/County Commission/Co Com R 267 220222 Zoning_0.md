| 0:39:33| I will say we have about, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| 11 individuals, including Mr. Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| who had signed up to speak on public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And I'll certainly allow that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| because it is public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| and under our rules, public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| you can have up to three minutes per speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| With this number of speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| three is what I would set it at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I just would remind you that we want to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| the opposition and the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| as equal time as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| So I would ask you please consolidate your remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| or let Mr. Sanders do the majority of the speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Mr. Campbell, you have the floor first, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Yes, sir, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Hopefully it won't take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| The parcel, we believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| meets all the criteria for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| It has sewer and water availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| It has access to Sevierville Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| which is immediately near Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| And the topography of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| is good on the part we want to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| There are some steep parts, as Ms. Brooks mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| that we are trying to stay clear of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And so we believe that it is a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| I think we're under three units an acre on our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And again, we don't have a lot of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| that meets those three criteria right out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| And so we believe it's a reasonable thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| to ask for zoning at what we're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| So that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Okay, thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| I want to have the time, please, set 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| We'll stop it when we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| but I'll let Mr. Sanders go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| You'll state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2478)|

| 0:41:27| and I did tell Daniel I would give him 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| And I want him to have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Fifteen minutes is more than fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| I want to thank Commissioner Daly for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| and I don't think we'll use that entire time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| but I do thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2498)|

| 0:41:40| And Mr. Campbell will have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| for response and rebuttal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| And we will have multiple speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| so I'll hand it off here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2509)|

| 0:41:52| Daniel Sanders, Lowe, Yeager, and Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| I represent members of the Dry Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| and Bays Mountain community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| who are opposed to this sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| and rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| If you are here in opposition, please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| So this is the thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| And so in addition to those here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| you have a petition with 600,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| over 600 opposing signatures added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| And so I'm going to ask the group that's here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| yes or no, how would you have Commission vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Now, I'm going to ask you to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| and remain seated and be respectful of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| So last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| and Commissioner Jay and I spoke about this before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| last month Commissioner Jay made a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| that took several people in this county by surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| And I'm paraphrasing a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| but Commissioner Jay said that this county had chosen a path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| that is going to rely on private residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| to do infrastructure and push infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| were the words he used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And so I talked with Commissioner Jay before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| and I'm pleased to hear that he meant that in a lamenting way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| that he couldn't bring the rest of Commission with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| toward a more responsible approach to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| And so I applaud you for that, and that's the way I took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| So I'm with you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| And I think somebody should ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| well, why has past growth of 10% for each of the last two decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| left us in a position where we can't pay for public infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| What's happening, and how did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Well, study after study confirms that scattered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| and premature residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| doesn't pay for the additional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| that are demanded by the new residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| In this state and in others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| it's physical pressure imposed on local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| by scattered and premature unplanned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| that eventually leads to growth taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| Land use policy that relies on residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| to pay for existing infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| will only test the limits of how thin we are willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| to stretch existing tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| before we're compelled to adopt growth taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| And that's what's happened in this state and in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| You can look at it, it's plain to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| So are we on our way to a growth tax in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| It's been reported that we have $28 million in our capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| but we have a need for $31 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| for sidewalks in Hardin Valley alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| A responsible approach to residential growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| would be to use planning and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| to limit growth to those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| where existing tax revenue and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| will support the anticipated additional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| that will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| This isn't hard to do if you will just simply follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| the plans that are in place that we have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| And so I take Commissioner Jade's word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| that it's time for some of the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| to start asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| You know, where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Why are we trying to use residential growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| to pay for infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Thunder Mountain's requests are prime examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| of unplanned, scattered, and premature growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| In May 2021, Thunder Mountain purchased a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| on the southern edge of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| The property was and still is zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| It has an Agricultural General Plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| and a Rural Growth Policy Plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| All of these planning and zoning designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| were adopted through an orderly public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| and those designations shouldn't be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| absent compelling reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| The application is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| with Knox County's growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Section 3.5 of the plan limits extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| of the low-density residential designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| to areas where certain conditions are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| First, the property must be zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Will this property zoned agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Second, the property must have water and sewer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| We know the Bays Mountain ridgetop property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| doesn't have water and sewer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| It's also not accessible by suitable roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| Finally, the density has to be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| to one to three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| in an area where water and sewer are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| This proposal will result in densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| in excess of four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| where water and sewer are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| down on the low-lying land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and so that's why it violates the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| The second plan also fails on every factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| There are no significantly changed conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| There are no new roads or utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| and there are no planning errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| that result in a planning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| The intersection improvements on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| and Sevierville Pike were made not to spur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| residential growth in a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| but to address existing safety concerns on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| one of the most dangerous roads in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| The availability of water and sewer are just as they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| when the sector plan was adopted in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| The recent light industrial rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| simply aligned the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| to the long existing uses on Valgro Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| There are no trends in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| or population growth along Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| and we handed out a map just a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| that shows approximately 255 houses on 600 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| This development would put 255 houses on 65 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| and that's completely out of character with this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| The rezoning request should also fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| This proposal is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| with the purpose of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| because it places residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| within feet of industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| The noise from sandblasting and other uses on Valgro Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| will be a constant nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| for anyone who lives in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| Traffic is also a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| We have a traffic study that shows that this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| and developments like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| will increase traffic more than 35%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2927)|

| 0:49:00| this kind of growth way out on the edge of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| will also have negative direct and indirect effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| on the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| We can't pay for existing infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and this development will spread our resources even thinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| I provided you with a factual and legal basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| to deny this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| but more importantly, my clients, your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| and the voters in this county want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| who among you will show the leadership necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| to place us on a path toward a more responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| physically conservative approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=2977)|

| 0:52:56| but zoning is a little bit different than county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| because it's legislated but it's kind of quasi-judicial at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| and so we try to keep time as equal as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| so just please keep your remarks as concise as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3186)|

| 0:54:12| my family will be facing life-threatening situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3252)|

| 0:54:20| It is a very real concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| I live in my great-grandmother's home in a community I've loved for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3264)|

| 0:54:56| I sat in on a meeting with one of our elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| and I personally articulated my concerns to this elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| In a few words, I was told that my views, my concerns don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| My opinion doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3313)|

| 0:55:19| What was said is that this was a done deal and we don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| This was four months ago when this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Another thing that troubles me is that this developer has never attempted to talk to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| Nobody has ever reached out to speak to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I know they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| They own the property, and I know they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| But with so many people to be affected in such a drastic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| human decency would have at least meant some reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| The developers don't live in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| They care nothing about the people who live in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| They care nothing about what we will face if these buildings are allowed to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3372)|

| 0:57:06| Thank you, Ms. Ogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| There's a couple of commissioners with their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| I want to give Mr. Campbell an opportunity if you want to speak, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3431)|
| 0:57:20| I don't know that I can say much except to say that we believe that we are in compliance with what your policy says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| in relation to the urban growth, and MPC has done their analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| They have also issued an opinion that we are in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| We're going for three units an acre, under three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| We have water and sewer availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| And Mr. Sanders mentioned that there have been no changes in the past whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| but there have been some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Obviously, they talk about there being safety changes and other changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| but there have been changes that have been made to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| We understand that this is a change condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| All development is a change condition, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| However, we are sitting, this piece of property sits with an industrial park beside it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| and a cemetery, a very nice cemetery on the other side in very close proximity to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| We believe those areas meet the criteria to be developed so that we don't have to go into very rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3500)|
| 0:58:31| that have no water, no sewer, no road access, and try to do something there to force something in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| Again, we believe that we can create a quality development here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| and we understand that every piece of property has its challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| We understand that every acreage has things, and that's why we try to work as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| to overcome those and create something that's quality that the community at some point in time will be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| I'll shut up and answer questions if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you, Mr. Campbell. I'm going to look to Commissioner Jay first and then Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| I'll yield to the district commissioner first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| I agree with Mr. Sanders about the growth plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:28| Bear with me, if you all. I'm just going to give you a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| In 2001, a growth and sector plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| The current plan is a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Sewer can be there three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| That's what was agreed upon in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| That's 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| No more than three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| Our 2007 sector plan did not show the growth of the area, including the sewer and pump station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| In 2007, we didn't even have Mountain Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Mountain Grove came along and started our growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| Everybody likes Lowe's and everybody loves Food City and all this, so that's beginning to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| We all don't want growth, but we've got to have this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| We've got to have these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| In 2007, at the sector plan, it didn't show the upcoming sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:34| The additions, I want to go across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| I'm not sure if it's 2007 or 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| AT&T, Urgent Care, Starbucks, tire discounters that sold for $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3644)|
| 1:00:55| It's unbelievable that a lot was sold for $3 million in South Knox for tire discounters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3655)|
| 1:01:05| 2012 was the last update at the sector plan, and it should have shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| I'm going to ask Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| In 2017, it didn't show the sewer line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| The upgrade is the pump station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| It didn't even also show that the Balgrove Industrial Park could be expanded to an EC zone, which is an employment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3685)|
| 1:01:35| Not industrial, but an employment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Commissioner, are you referring to the 2012 sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| Well, that's the only one we've got to go by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| I'm talking 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| If we did a 2017 sector plan, this would have been seen, or could have been seen, in 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3709)|
| 1:01:59| Possibly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| With all the public meetings, everything is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| But we did not have a sector plan in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| We're working off a 10-year sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| From 2012 to 2022, 10 sector plans have been asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:23| Eight of those have been since 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| That's because we don't have a 2017 sector plan in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| It's 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| I've got news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3752)|

| 1:02:37| that we are going to have to decide on a sector plan because we did not update it in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| That's not planning's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| It's just the way things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3767)|

| 1:06:38| These units will be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| There's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| They're going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| Chapman Highway traffic flow in the new intersection, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| It is said that this intersection, which is Silver Hebel Pike, goes in Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| south end, and it also goes at Valborough, East Sampson, through Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| It's been said that these are not major improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I'd like to hear a professional opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Knox County didn't make those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| They were made by Tennessee Department of Transportation at the expense of several million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| So in my professional opinion, I would think those would constitute significant transportation improvements in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4043)|
| 1:07:32| Now, Valborough Road, East Sampson, was below grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Now that intersection is at grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| What's the significance between a below grade entrance exit and an at grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| It's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Obviously, the line of sights are much better there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| You're sitting level with the oncoming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| They've also separated the turning movements from Sampson east and west, which eliminates a lot of conflict points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| So, I mean, I think there has been significant safety improvements made in this section of Chapman Highway as part of the state project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4085)|
| 1:08:16| While we're on that area there, there's a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| There was a plan out there and it shows two entrances and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| One is on Valgrove and one is on Super Durable Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| What is the width of Super Durable Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| It varies, obviously, depending on the location you measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Near Valgrove Road, it's about 19 and a half feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| Pretty much at the proposed location of the development entrance, it would be 18 and a half feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| And then it kind of varies between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| We never found the width lower than 18, but we found some close to 20 up towards Henrich Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4138)|
| 1:09:08| What is the traffic down in the 24-hour period on Super Durable Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| It's varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| The TPO's traffic counts range, they kind of hover a little bit above or a little bit below 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| So, I mean, in general round numbers, I would say the average daily traffic on that section of Super Durable Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| in a 24-hour period is roughly 1,000 vehicles a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| If this was to be approved at a certain number, whatever that number may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| I'm willing to use 3,000 daily trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Would that be adequate for Super Durable Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| In our professional opinion, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| That would add the background traffic of 1,000 plus the 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| That would add 4,000 cars to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| It's our experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| A lot of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Because I've looked up that, you know, a road that has that same characteristic width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| Gleason Road, you know, West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| It operates at 10,000 cars a day and has similar characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| So, I think at 4,000 trips a day, this road would operate in a capacity that would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4217)|
| 1:10:26| and without any major safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| What is the crash data for the last 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:40| We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| It falls below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Obviously, crashes in general are random in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| Sometimes what we look for is what are causative factors, things that show trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| And so, we looked at more of a rate perspective using the volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| because it's more what we consider to be an accurate assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| rather than just a number, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| And it was below the statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| So, essentially, a road of this width and this traffic is going to experience so many crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| just by random nature, and it was below that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| So, from our perspective, we did not necessarily see the addition of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| and its trips to be detrimental to the traffic conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Does anyone agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| Gallery, please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| You've been awesome, but just please be courteous while questions are being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Would you explain, you or Amy, what Director Brooks, Blue Line Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| it's been on social media that they've been bulldozing the streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| and they've dammed the stream area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| What is a blue line stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Blue line streams, water is the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| The state categorizes those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Typically, on a U.S. quad map, they'll show up as a blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| or as a blue line, so hence the terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| We did, I guess some of the folks did call our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| We did send out some inspection staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| and what we determined on site was really just property clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| some logging that was consistent with ag practices, and we did not necessarily see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Guys, please, you're going to have to please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| If you disagree with what's being said, that's okay, but please be courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| I mean, I don't want to clear the room because you guys have been amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| and you're here for a good reason, but please be courteous while discussion is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| My staff did not see anything that constituted the need for a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| There was some clearing of fence rows, some logging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| but those activities were consistent with agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| Before anything could happen, a traffic study would have to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| by the property owner, developer, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Who pays for that traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| The developer pays for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| and Knox County Engineering and Knoxville Planning assigned the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| Based on the number of trips that would potentially be generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| it would fall between maybe even as much as a level three study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| So we would be asking the developer to look at not only their entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| but at least one other entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| most likely the intersection of Sevierville Pike and Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| to see if a signal was warranted or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| So it would be looking at at least their intersection and one offsite intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| It was mentioned by Mr. Sanders about the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| The infrastructure for the road, sewer, electrical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| and all the responsibility of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| and no tax dollars will go towards a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| It has to be at the county standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| The developer has to, when he submits his plat to create the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| he is asserting that either those utilities are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| or he will provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| At this road study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| if it comes back that there's necessary road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| either to Sevierville Pike or Valgrove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| who's responsible for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| The land developer or the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| Let's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| You and I asked you to look up some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| I don't know if you got them yet or not on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| what the traffic count is at Chapman Highway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Would it handle the extra 2,000, 3,000 trips a day at Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:09| The Chapman Highway, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| TPO staff does a really good job of capturing this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| The closest count station, which is really close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| near Bowerfield, just north of Bowerfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4519)|

| 1:15:58| I'm just using real rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Yes, in our opinion, the traffic analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| this Chapman Highway would accommodate the additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| and still operate in somewhat of a similar level of service or delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| as it currently does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| One of the things that I did see on social media that says that our schools are overcrowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| I really wish they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| So we could get another middle school, we could get another high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| They're not overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| I wish they were. I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I graduated from Doyle in 78, and we had South Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| I'd like to see it back that way where we have two high schools and two middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| That ain't going to happen, not in any short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| That's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| I'm going to turn it over to Commissioner Jay, but I would like the Chancellor to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4615)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Can I just get some clarification on a few items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| This could be Ms. Brooks or Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| Based on the density that's being asked for, I know that we're getting a little bit ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| because that's part two of this discussion, but what's the number of proposed homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4646)|
| 1:17:35| Based on what's being proposed or what was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| What was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Taking in the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| It is a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Part of it is this, part of it is that, part of it is something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| Yeah, so the total number of units, as recommended by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| was no more than 255 units for the total property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| And that takes into factor hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| So there's a distinction between the 95 acres, which is the steeper portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| versus the 64 acres, which is more of the flatter portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| And Mr. Snowden, you all have inspected the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| We've had land development inspection staff out there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4705)|
| 1:18:36| And there is water and sewer available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| When was that made available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| I don't know specifically dates of when Knox Chapman installed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| but our GIS that we share with Knox Chapman does show adequate sewer and water along Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| And are the other residents in this area on that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| That I don't know about, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Mr. Sanders, I'm going to just ask for you to kind of represent versus calling individuals up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4744)|
| 1:19:14| Of the constituents you represent, are none of them on the water and sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| Are they a majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| I mean, do you have this knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| Only the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| The church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Only the church is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Show of hands, who's got sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| I have a couple questions, so don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| Do you have any, Mr. Snowden, do you have any understanding of why Knox Chapman invested such a huge amount of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| with water and sewer when the current residents are not accessing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| I mean, did they do it specifically to support future growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| I don't know specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| I do know we worked with the development of the Valgrove, the commercial park, did have some fire supply issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4804)|
| 1:20:14| so our fire bureau did work with them and there was some installation to provide for better fire flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| But beyond that, I don't have any specifics as far as why Knox Chapman did what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Right, so I was in the room for some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| There's not very much private, or there is private fire suppression on Valgrove Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Talk more on this, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| There is private fire suppression on Valgrove Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| My understanding is that it's been upgraded because they wanted to do some additional occupancy permits in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4840)|
| 1:20:52| You're talking about in the industrial area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| But it's a private system that doesn't have anything to do with public facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| And to your point about the water and sewer, it's my understanding that the church is the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| and there may be one or two other residents on the sewer, but the church installed that sewer in order to build the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| And there's a tap fee that's – I understand there's a tap fee that you have to pay the church if you want to get on the sewer out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4876)|
| 1:21:24| So the sewer was installed by the church back in – I don't know, back way before the sector plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| and I don't know what date it was, but that hasn't changed since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| And another point that was made earlier, there is sewer along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| You've got to pay the church for a tap fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| There's not water and sewer available to the Base Mountain Ridge property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| The Base Mountain Ridge property doesn't have sewer available to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| In my reading of the growth policy plan, if you're going to extend the low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| you're going to have to find that that whole extension has water and sewer available to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| I don't think it's appropriate to extend water and sewer through an area that doesn't have water and sewer to get to a place that does have water and sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4925)|
| 1:22:15| That's part of the – that's a part of our problem with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| If you read the growth policy plan, it's clear that that's a condition precedent to amend in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4938)|
| 1:22:26| I have another question, but do you have more sewer discussion to add to the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| But don't go anywhere, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Just for having a fun time with that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| So there is a pump station at the corner of the property that will be able to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| The two properties are contiguous that have the low area that will go around the industrial part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| that can serve the mountainside part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| And we've already had discussions with the industrial part because they have failing septic tanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| about some extension through that property into the thing, so into our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4973)|
| 1:23:01| So if you want to get – technically, sewer is still available to two contiguous properties owned by the same property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| going into both pieces of property, that would feed the industrial part as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| because we go beside that as we would extend service to the rest of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Mr. Sanders, you mentioned – and I'm going to paraphrase you this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5003)|
| 1:23:32| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| The industrial uses of the center portion of that general area, I don't know what the businesses are that are in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5013)|
| 1:23:42| but I think it's pretty significant, that industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| You essentially – do you mean to say that – you said since there's an industrial area in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| it's not proper to put in residential next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| So does that mean as soon as there's an industrial area, nothing can ever go around it housing-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| So you've seen the subdivision layout for this particular thing, and that's part of our problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| You're taking density from this ridgetop area and you're going to cluster it down on this 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| Well, the resulting density there is over four – it's about four and a half dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| if you look at that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| The residential uses are right up against the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5070)|
| 1:24:38| I saw a video the other day that was taken from Base Mountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| You can hear the sandblasting and the other noises coming off of the industrial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| clear across the Base Mountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| So the houses that are going to sit sort of jammed in between Base Mountain Road and the industrial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| are going to be inundated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| There's nothing you can do to control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| But that's a free market decision about whether somebody wants to live there, not a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| if somebody wants to live next to an industrial area, we could pick a thousand places in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| that have housing right next to an industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| That's their right to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| That's not our – I mean that has nothing to do with the sector plans of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| That's a taste police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Well, respectively, one of the purposes of the zoning ordinance and zoning generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| is to separate those sort of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| And throughout the county you'll see an industrial use that's next to a commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| and then transitions into maybe a high-density residential use and then a low-density residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| Go to Beverly Road and look at an industrial factory sitting right next to three neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| I don't think that jives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| That happens everywhere in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Well, it's a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| And to say that there's some sort of vague notion that there's a market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| well, why not just throw the zoning out altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| Well, that's not appropriate because you have the authority to say yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| this is appropriate here or not appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| I'm going to yield the floor because I do have a couple other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| but I want to give colleagues –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I just have one other question right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Is the position of the community that nothing should ever be built there ever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| Well –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Let your representatives speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| So I think that they're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| And they said that, no, it's not our position that nothing should ever be built there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| but they're concerned with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| And quite frankly, they haven't had the developer reach out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| except to bulldoze a fence line and a tree and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| And Carson, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| has been kind enough to sort of set some of those things straight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| but there's never been an offer to compromise on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| The density, like I say, four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| if you look at just the 64 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| that's entirely inconsistent with this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| We've got densities out there that are less than half a dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| And now you want to dump on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| what's going to appear to be four dwelling units per acre, four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to yield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| but I would like to come back towards the end of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Both the applicant and the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| and I believe Commissioner Daley made a reference to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5248)|
| 1:27:37| What is the position of the law director's office on the growth policy plan in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| Well, we have made it clear several times that, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| the growth policy plan expired by its own terms in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| when the agreement between the city and the county expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| However, we had a meeting over the last couple of weeks with the county mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| and it is the position of the executive branch of the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| that we should abide by the growth policy plan during the period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| while we are attempting to come up with a new comprehensive plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| And so the law director's office, Ms. Brooks, the attorney for MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| we all decided that that was going to be the position we were going to take going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| In addition, at least as far as the density is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| I think MPC has found that that would be consistent, I think, with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| Am I incorrect in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| It's up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| Next question is for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Could you go to our packet online there to page 8 of the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| And this might help to explain things for me a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| Let me know when you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| It's the one with the blue highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| It says page 8 of 33 in the PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| Can you get online to pull up your file from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| I have the file in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| The file that was sent over from the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| Yes, that was sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Page 8, there's a drawing with blueprint, blue highlights of the two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5389)|
| 1:29:57| the two different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| I'm familiar with the two different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| This one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| I think at this distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Yes, I'm familiar with the two different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| The lower portion that butts up against Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| that's the rural residential at one dwelling unit an acre, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| If this zoning was to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| and this is all considered one track of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| can the developer put all of the units on the upper portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| which was originally set for 160 acres and then 95,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| excuse me, 160 units on the top and 95 units on the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| could they put all 255 units on that top portion where it says PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| up to three dwelling units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| So then the bottom 95 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| is the developer required to make that a conservation easement so that no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| other structures would go on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| We have no mechanism to require them to put it into a conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| but they couldn't come back at a later date and try to add additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| density because they would have already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| if they were to build the 250 approximately units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| they wouldn't be able to come back later and request, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| they could request more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| but they'd have to come back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| We wouldn't be able to allow them to do that via a plan submittal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| In five years when they build out the top portion of 255 housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| be a different planning commission, different commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| they could come back and say, we want 200 homes for that 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| And they'd have to go back through the process of rezoning and plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| But even though they've already used up those dwelling units in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| original application here, if they get approved for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| So they get double shots just because they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| And that's true with any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| So any property that you rezone to plan residential up to X number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| there is not a limitation on a property owner applicant coming back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| the future and asking for additional density or a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| And then I just have one question, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| you said there was 11 people that wanted to do public forum for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| And we got about three or four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| There are additional people that signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| I was actually looking to Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| I mean, we didn't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| So thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| Mr. Sanders, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| I would like to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| The other thing that's real looming in the background of this is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| that the interpretation is allowing the developer to cluster these units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| from this 95 acres down to the 65 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| And you've hit on a very important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Yes, you can go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| It may not stay like that forever, so there's no guarantee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| But beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| if you look at the sector plan and the depictions of clustering in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| planning documents and the zoning documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| it's always a relatively contiguous tract that clusters development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| And then you have this large peripheral area where you have open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| and trees and it looks nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| This is a total misuse of that process, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| and that's another reason to vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| because these tracts are relatively disconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| There's not a road or anything that goes between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| There's not sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| There's not roads on the upper tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| And now you want to bring density way down here on the lower tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| We just feel like it's a misuse of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| I'll look to Commissioner Sniff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| I keep hearing it called industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| It's actually an economic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| What is it called that's back in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| It's an industrial employment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| Employment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| It's factories, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| You know, it's really kind of out of place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| and Mr. Sanders, you know, usually you have industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| you have commercial, then you have medium-high density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| then you get to regular residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Ms. Brooks, as we go forward with our comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| what is the possibility of what goes around this in our new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| I think it would be premature for me to speculate what we would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| for this particular industrial area without going to the community input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| But like you said, it is kind of an odd location for this type of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| for this cluster of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| But in all probably likelihood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| residential housing would probably be the least invasive use that would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| around an industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| Logan City Residential is one of the, I mean, it just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| I mean, there's a number of factors in terms of how impactful it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| and all the items we've discussed this evening so far, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| what is the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| You know, does it have sewer and water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| But, yes, I mean, if you're, I think if the question is residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| I'm not sure that I'm fully understanding what your question is on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| I guess I'm just wondering if when the comprehensive plan comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| if something worse could be going around this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| I don't think that we would, my speculation is we wouldn't recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| an increase in industrial uses in the site, given its location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Commissioner Ward, you haven't spoken on this yet, I don't believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| so I'll look to you and then to Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Mr. Sanders, can I ask you a question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Since you are the representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| you guys don't want 4.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| so where do you guys land on what density do you want to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| Well, I wrote a letter to this commission that said 145 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| on this lower portion of property would be acceptable as a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| and I think that works out to about two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| But still, I mean, that's a big change from basically the map that you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| shows 255 units on nearly 600 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| and then we got 145 that will, you know, more than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| that's a multiple, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| What do you, how do you compromise with the character of your community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| And these folks, they clearly don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| they appreciate the rural nature of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| The policy plan calls it rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| The sector plan calls it agriculture, and the zoning calls it agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| When the developer bought this property in the middle of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| those were the expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| This is us turning another farm into basically a high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| or a higher-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| So how do you, we put that in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| We have not heard anything out of the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| so I think they would be willing to compromise with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| You heard them say they didn't oppose development altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| It would be nice to have some sort of separation between the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| and the industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| Commissioner Jay mentioned that, you know, that's a market decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| But, you know, sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5899)|
| 1:38:27| You can put houses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| If the noises are too loud for people to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| they're going to move out and the place is going to get run down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| because nobody wants to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| And, you know, we don't see residential developments like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| near industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| There's always a separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Mr. Campbell, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Just a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| First of all, we didn't get a copy of that letter for compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| so this communication thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| obviously we all need to do better at communicating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| but we didn't get a copy of that letter either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| I believe the original recommendation from MPC had those two densities bifurcated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| There was 180, I believe, on the lower part and some density on the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| I don't remember off the top of my head what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| It was during the planning commission process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| that the planning commission voted to consolidate that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| and they consolidated based on the fact that we said we don't want to really get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| into the steep areas of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| A, it's not environmentally correct to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| because we would be denuding a tremendous amount of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| that we don't want to be into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| The second thing is it's just not economically feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| to build infrastructure on top of a mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| unless you're putting some sort of multi-story chalet type thing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| And so that's what the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| and that's what we originally kind of came before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| It was at the planning commission process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| that this 255 units on this part got put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| So I just want everybody to understand when we came to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| we said we were okay with what was originally done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| as far as those densities recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| and it was during that process that that kind of got put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| So that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Looking at this property, Mr. Campbell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| is this the old, is this the industrial part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| that Mr. B.A. Bauer built out there many, many years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| I believe it is, and actually one of his heirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| is one of the part owners of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| And so I believe the reason more of that was not industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| was because he wanted to kind of not have to pay the tax burden on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| by making it more industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| And so, and I hate to back up, and you've asked me a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| but, Mr. Smith, you asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| the typical pattern of development is to go from a major intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| to something very high density commercial to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| And so I assume that if we came back in a couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| the growth plan was no longer valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| that we could very legitimately ask for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| that was a whole lot more onerous than what we're asking for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| So I'm sorry, Mr. Bussler, you had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| I knew Mr. B.A. Bauer personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| and he was a unique man, and he got things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| in a roundabout way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| So he got that built out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| but he did leave all the other stuff agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| so he wouldn't have to pay the taxes on the rest of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| So a problem was created there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| and now we're looking at it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| and in the future we have another problem coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| and it is the lack of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| And some people tell me here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| that we're 8,000 houses short of where we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| for people that are wanting to come into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| And it gets to the point where the land becomes more and more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| to use to build affordable housing for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| So we've got to look at that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| That's another thing that we've got to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| And there's a lot of people who want to live here in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| and a lot of people want to live in the Seymour area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| And I don't know how we solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| If we start limiting housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| or we use a thing like what Mr. Bauer did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| to build this commercial unit here to keep people from building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| you know, we didn't know that the zonings were going to be like they are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| where you have the industrial and then lesser zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and then lesser zoning until you get to the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| So if there was some way that we could have a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| that would fill both needs but still supply the houses that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| I wouldn't want to live around in industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| with the sanding going on and things of that sort that's used in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| But there's housing needs coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| And if we limit it now, we're going to be like some of the other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| that limited their housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| and you'll see big swatches of subdivisions cut in half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| with roads going through there to get people into those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| There's a lot of things going on, and I want to get back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| We've got two problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| We've got the industrial housing there that's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| people won't want to live around, but we need the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| Now how are we going to compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| How are we going to work together for people in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| that can afford those houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| And so that's a problem you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| How are you going to help other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| to have what their dreams are, to have a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| and live in an area that you're out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| where you're away from a lot of the city noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| and things of that sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| We've got a big problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| and I don't know how we're going to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| I'm just saying we've got to think about both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| We just can't think about ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| So let's open up for some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| of how we're going to get to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you for letting me talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Is the developer willing to make any infrastructure improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| say, to roads, park, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Well, the roads, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| if there's some deficiency that we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| I mean, it's on our dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| During this whole concept planning phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| So, yes, ma'am, if there's other upgrades that have to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| we certainly have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| That's part of our obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| and they're willing to do that, no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| And my other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| going off of what Commissioner Bussler was just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| what kind of compromise can we come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| would the developer be willing to compromise two units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| I think right now we would like to go back to what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| I mean, if there's a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| I mean, we want to go back to what your professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| had come up with before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| which was there were, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| 180 units on this property and 75 on the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| I call it the hillside, but there's buildable places there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| The analysis was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| They did it in a consistent way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| It gets us under three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| I think the 180 is 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| That may be, my math may be off a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| but somewhere in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| And then we're under one an acre on the hillside part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| So, again, just, I hate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| you hate to negotiate standing here at the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| because you're trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| But that would be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| we would just like to go back to whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| the original recommendation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| And that gets us fairly close to what the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| they just mentioned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Commissioner Daley, we are back to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| We got into the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| before we got really straight through to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| I'm not going to, I'm in a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| I'm not going to make you both sides happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| I'm going to, I'm going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| that we approve the sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| because we've got sufficient road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| The sector plan being 10 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| I will make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| And after that, I'm going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| that we do what staff has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| Staff says 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| I gave you all an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Staff says 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| On the lower part, no more than 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Community, Daniel wanted 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| They want 220 to 255, whatever that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| I'm not going to make either one of you happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| My motion is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| that we go with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| of no more than 180 on that lower part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| That's going to be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| And that's going to be below three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| That's going to be in the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| That's going to be under the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| up to three years straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| I'm going to go home tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| I'm not going to sleep well, I can promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| I'll make both people mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| But we need to grow in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| I've got 174 units coming in behind my house up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| on John Speer Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Do I like it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| No, I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| But that was part of the growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| You all know that I follow the growth in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| I have always done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| With the staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| of only 180 units on that lower part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| That will be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| No more than 180 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| That's what I want to yield to Mr. J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| but then I will make the motion on the sector plan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Commissioner J, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| I don't want to do anything until there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I don't want to go through my part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| until there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| He hasn't formally made the motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| Would you like to yield to him to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Sorry, I didn't want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| You have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| This is probably one of the most unusual developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| to consider I've seen in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| I've driven out there twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| and the first time I drove out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| I just went, okay, this is really weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| This is an industrial area town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| surrounded by a lot of farmland, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| with neighborhoods on a ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| that used to be somebody else's farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| I mean, let's be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| You all live in homes that used to be somebody else's farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| that had the same argument that you've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| and on and on we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| And then you're right on the church with a cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| and then right on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| with a huge commercial development right on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| I mean, you couldn't have picked a more unusual combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| all at the same time, which is, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| It's just very, very difficult to consider all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| There's a lot I agree with on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| I agree with Commissioner Daley that growth is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| This is the discussion we're going to have every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Growth is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Things are going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| and they're going to be built around areas where other growth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| And shops and restaurants and commerce and industry and business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| those are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Those bring people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Schools bring people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| More people bring more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| That's how it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| And so this community, just like every other community in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| Growth is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| People are coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| But also families are staying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| and other generations want to raise their family here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| So it's just not feasible for everything to stay the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| unless you buy the land and decide you want to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| So there's got to be a balance in between with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| It does concern me, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| that this is probably one of the first really controversial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| where the property owner and representatives have not sought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| to sit down and work through some kind of compromise before today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| That really bugs me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| because almost every time we get through something that has a big issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| they've at least tried to find some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| If you all aren't against all development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| but you don't want this and they want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| but they don't want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| you try to come together and you find an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| And while you may not have gotten a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| there's not a chance that anybody involved in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| has not seen that there is major opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| You just drive around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| So, look, I'm sort of stuck in the middle with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| I get both sides, but what I would like to actually see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| and there's no motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| so I don't really want to do a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| and I certainly don't want to circumvent the district commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| because I'm an at-large commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| But what I would like to see is both of these postponed for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| so that the groups can come together, the developer can come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| the property owners can come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Try to find some compromise that has some balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| You all will have to give a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| and understand that people are going to be your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| They are going to live there and they are going to be your neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| and whether they choose to exit to an industrial site or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| it's not your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| That's their choice to buy the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| At the same time, I do believe the developer and the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| they have to come to the table and say, how can we make this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| because there are concerns and you don't want to start a fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| with your neighbor on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| So I'm not going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| I might make a substitute motion depending on where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| I'd like to encourage Commissioner Daley and others to maybe let this simmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Let the teams come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| Let's find something and find a way to grow South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6776)|

| 1:53:04| So thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Commissioner Lundy, you've not spoken on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| I agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| That's one thing that is very important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| is developers and communities come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| We all know that we need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| But I shut down once I hear that the developer didn't reach out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| community, because sometimes I feel like developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| or some people don't feel like the community are investors in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| You are investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| You may or may not have a million dollars or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| but when you chose to buy that house or preserve the house that's been passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| down, you invest in that land, and that's your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| It is tough, but we didn't talk about this for an hour and 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| and I think we probably could have toned this down if developers respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| the community and the community respects developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| because we do need housing, and that's the huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| But I will agree and support Commissioner Jay if he does make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| of delaying it, because we can't go on like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| It has to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Commissioner Daley, we're back to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| Like I said, I'm not going to make either side happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| One side wants 255, the other side wants 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| I think staff did a real good job on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| It's within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| It's within the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| It's in everything that we agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| So I am going, you know, 180, 255 down to 180 and 64 to 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6897)|
| 1:55:09| That's about a middle compromise that you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| I'm going to prose that compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6913)|

| 1:55:29| Will you talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Is 180 agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| See, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| It's not agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| I'm going to make the motion that we amend the sector plan per staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6944)|
| 1:55:52| because, yes, Mr. Snowden says there are major improvements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| and two, our sector plan is 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| And I'm making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=6960)|

| 1:57:44| We'll sit down and talk and see what a fair number is. 64 is not a fair number. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7064)|

| 1:58:03| but I don't believe we can take action on it until we take action on the one we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| postponed. Do we have to make a motion on it to postpone it? Certainly. Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| please read item 57 into the record. It's 11-F-21RZ. It's also a request of Thunder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7092)|

| 1:58:43| Lundy, I do as well. We asked for a rezoning for a number. Until we have the number, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7123)|
| 1:58:52| really, really, really hard to sit down and show the community exactly what we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| to do and how we're going to do it. We usually have those meetings more at concept plan phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| when we have them. Now, there's a stick drawing out there that we tried to do to show what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| we thought we could do, but that's not an official plan. That's just something we tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| to put together to show that stuff was possible. So, again, you've made your decision. We respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| that decision. However, understand until we get to concept plan and we really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-zoning?start=7157)|
