| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Just kind of bring you guys up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Yeah, we'd love to hear from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Now we have to vote on the motion to add and delete and amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| We've had that motion first and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Opposed, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=239)|
| 0:04:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| We have several people that want to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| I'll try to group them together as to what they want to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| One there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| That's already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| And I'll call your name if you'll come on to the podium and we'll do those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| And before we do that, I'd like to just make a little quick statement, a little apology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| for things that I felt like have gotten a little blown out of proportion or on some discussions last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| Commissioner Brewer, as I said to you, or if I made a mistake or apologized, anything for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| and the good job that you're doing for your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| I appreciate what you bring to us as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| So, thank you for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| I appreciate the apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| So, first on the in no particular order that I've got these, Barbara Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| Barbara, is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Barbara, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| I saw you last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=319)|
| 0:05:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| I'm a little gimpy these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Yes, I'm here to talk about the redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Barbara Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| I live at 1302 Luttrell Street in the Forth and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| I bought my first house in Forth and Gill in 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| It's been there 32 years, a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| I'd like to speak about the redevelopment of Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| I understand there has been a the evaluation committee or whatever they're called has picked the winning bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=358)|
| 0:06:09| I would like to point out that I think you all have a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Evaluation tabulation, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| They're making copies of that, Barbara, for us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| So they'll all have a copy by the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Basically, there were three evaluators that were chosen from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| I mean, from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| And then there was a, I think it was a purchasing agent who got to score it for how it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=392)|
| 0:06:42| how it would benefit the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Basically, how much money the county would get from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| If you look at the tabulations, and I'll get down to the bottom, the winning project ended up with 439 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=408)|
| 0:06:57| The next project had 429.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| But the winning project got all 50 points for the benefit to the county, which was $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=420)|
| 0:07:10| So if you take those 50 points off, the winning project had a total of 389, and the next one had 429.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=430)|
| 0:07:20| So the only difference was the amount of money that they were willing to pay for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| which in my view is very short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| The winning project is also a 501c3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| They're not going to pay property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| And the only reason that they can afford to give $500,000 to the county for that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| which I have been informed, by the way, that the county paid $1,000 for when they bought it from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| That's pretty good profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| They can do that because they're going to, this is going to be a low-income senior housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| and they are going to get tax credits, tax advantages, very low interest rate loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=478)|
| 0:08:08| And my estimate has been or I have heard that they're going to save about $4 million just in the preferential interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=488)|
| 0:08:19| over a private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| So no wonder they can give the county $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| I think that is very, very short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| I don't think this project in the long run will benefit the county as much as a private development with mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=509)|
| 0:08:39| Which brings me to the next issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| The Community Design Center was asked to do research into this to help with RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=522)|
| 0:08:52| and to make recommendations for the redevelopment of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Which they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| There were public meetings held to get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And the Community Design Center came up with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| And do you all have copies of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| That's coming too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Maybe I should have been at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| But anyway, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| It specifically states on page four of the recommendations that senior or assisted living is an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| but with the current development of Oakwood School and other existing nearby senior living options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| the market may be saturated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Knoxville High School may also be too large for an effective senior citizen's housing environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| The senior living options already in place in the area include assisted and independent living in both public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and private developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| And we do have a lot on that side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=583)|

| 0:10:35| You name it, we get it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=635)|

| 0:11:09| This is the people that live there are affected by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Do not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=673)|

| 0:11:33| Why in the world they would pick an RFP that goes totally against what the community wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=693)|

| 0:11:50| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Next on the same bill, Murrah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Name and address for our record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| My name is Bill Murrah, M-U-R-R-A-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| I've lived at 1111 Gratz Street for 38 years, 39 years, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| I lived in the Forth and Gill Neighborhood for 41 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| And I helped form the current Forth and Gill Neighborhood Organization in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| And out of that organization, we helped to support the development of Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Oakwood Lincoln Park, and Park Ridge Neighborhood Organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| I worked for 10 years for the community organization and was, as early as in the early 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=753)|
| 0:12:42| involved with trying to do development in our communities to stabilize what was then a very low-income community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| that was deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| I want to start with a disclaimer that I want to make sure that you all know that I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=771)|
| 0:12:59| as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I am on the board of the Forth and Gill Neighborhood Organization, but I'm here as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| But I'm going to give you some information that's related to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| so I wanted to make sure that you know the role that I'm speaking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| Because one of the things I want to do is to correct some misinformation that you have received in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| You received a memo dated on November the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| It was an honest mistake, but I still feel like it needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| You received a memo from someone in the law department saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| it now appears that Dewhurst Properties, in conjunction with the Forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| and Gill Neighborhood Association, are urging the award to go to Dewhurst Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| And I want to tell you that that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| And I'm not accusing anyone of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| I just think it's important that you know that that was an honest mistake, but it was an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| The voice of the Forth and Gill Neighborhood Association comes from its board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| And the board of directors of the Neighborhood Association has not taken a stand about this issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| And I'm confident will not be taking a stand between now and your meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| So I wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| Secondly, I wanted to say, and part of that is because the board isn't taking a stand because there's a lot of disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| in our community, which was exhibited last night, Mr. Smith and Ms. Broyles, you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| You saw that there were lots of diverse opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| In fact, there was even a kind of a straw vote at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| And the vote was almost exactly split, but it bent toward your process a little more than it did against your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=879)|
| 0:14:49| But let's just say it was close to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| So our neighborhood has a major disagreement about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| And there is no formal support for one proposal or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| So now I wanted to try to get at some to inform you about how I got involved in looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| Up until about four weeks ago, I was dumber than a sack of hammers about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| I'm really apologizing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| I should have been informed, but I was not informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| And so at our last board meeting, I think it was October 21st, the developers came and talked to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| And the losing developer presented to us why he thought the evaluation process that you all had gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=929)|
| 0:15:39| the RFP process, the committee process with five people, the evaluation, and the conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| he pointed out to us how he thought that was not fair, that it was not properly done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| Well, that concerned me because I thought if your process, the county process, was not properly done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| then it was incumbent on us as the board of Forth and Gill to look into that and take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| So I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| And this is what I did to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| I spoke personally with your county purchasing department, Matt Myers, who explained your process to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| shared with me written information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| I spoke with the community design center staff because they had been early a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| I spoke to representatives of both developers and asked them all this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| was the process fair and was it properly undertaken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| Every one of them said the process was fair and the process was properly undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=997)|
| 0:16:44| And all of them said that the reason the proposal lost, which Ms. Simpson referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| the reason Dewhurst did not get the proposal and Family Pride did the award, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| was that Dewhurst did not offer you money for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Now, it was presented to us at the board as if there was some confusion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Well, you know, perhaps some kind of subsidy for teachers should have been the same thing as paying the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| you know, buying the county for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| But your RFP, when I read the RFP the very first time, and I'm not, you know, I'm not the smartest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| I may have just fallen off the turnip wagon coming in from rural Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| but I'll tell you, I read it one time and I saw you ask in your RFP how much money are you going to pay us for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| building and you're going to get a score for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Now, somebody offered zero dollars for the building, and guess how many points they got for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| They got zero points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Somebody offered a half million dollars for the building, which was more than your appraisal for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| They got 50 points for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| That just doesn't look unfair to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| And so the more I looked into this, the more I thought this process was not unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| I didn't care who won the thing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| I really didn't because I knew you guys were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| I thought there were new people who were involved in it, including the design center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| I am convinced that your process was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| And I am convinced that then the winning, the person to whom your committee is proposing to award it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| now I'm convinced that they will do a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| They have been criticized because it's going to be senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Mark, can you, your time has passed, but if you want to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Let me just say that I'm hearing three main criticisms, and I won't go into those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| although I'll be prepared to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| One is that it's senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| I think that's, I'm a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I think I'm a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Okay, that's the short version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Two is that it's for poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| The poverty level in Knoxville, the federal poverty threshold is $11,450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| The base rent is $19,200 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| You can't pay a $19,200 a year payment in rent with $11,450 in income, which is the federal poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1152)|
| 0:19:22| You can hardly do it at twice the federal poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| Finally, the criticism has been made that the project, if you put seniors in there, it would be bad for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1165)|
| 0:19:34| Okay, they won't spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| I spend money, but anyway, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Okay, but I want to just read one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| From an article I just happened to have, and it's really two sentences, so don't get afraid here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| Older Americans are one of the country's prime engines of commerce and jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| In entertainment, apparel, and other important sectors, they account for close to half of all spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Companies need to provide product lines specifically tailored to the tastes and needs of older Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| So it seems to me that it's a crisis of the lack of imagination of business people who haven't yet figured out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| market to 100 seniors instead of saying it's to our economic disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Next on the same subject, Joe Petrie, I think it is, Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Joe, if you'll sort of watch the clock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| My name is Joe Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I office at 520 West Summit Hill, the Langley Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| I just wanted to talk on behalf of Family Pride and Southeast Housing Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| I was here the last time, and I made a couple of points just about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Today I did want to talk a little bit about a couple of things that have been brought up that I think are just incorrect information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| First of all, property taxes, 501C3 is not exempt from paying property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| They pay property taxes just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| They take any incentives that any other developer can take, but they pay property taxes just like the rest of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| Low income rates, low income, I'm sorry, low interest rates are incentives to do projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1266)|
| 0:21:15| They're there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| They're not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| That's not a great benefit to a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| It's just a benefit that is given to incentivize a nonprofit to do projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| So, as a developer, we take any kind of low interest rate that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| First of all, I would like to point out I have no financial interest in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| but I am on the board of Southeast Housing Foundation and have been just about since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| There was a market study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| There was an independent study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| There was also the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Both those things said that this could be in and among the best and highest uses for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| And then when the offer was made for the dollars, not only did they make an offer to pay for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| but they paid above what the county appraisal said was fair value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| If something doesn't pay, I agree with Mr. Borough, you don't get points for something that you don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| So I would urge you to follow the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| The process is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| The county purchasing department, in my opinion, does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| I've been through processes with them before as an independent developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| They do it fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| They do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| The process is tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| So I would urge you to follow the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| It's what we as developers come to depend on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Something that really bothered me, though, the last time I was here was I, and today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| I keep hearing the issue about seniors and low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| And both of those things bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| One, because it's misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Low income is a result of being a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| When you're retired and you live on a pension or you live on Social Security, that lessens your income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| So unless you have, you know, stocks, bonds, other private income like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| But typically, when you're a senior, it's just a product of your age that lowers your income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| That's not, that shouldn't classify you as a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| But more than that, age should have nothing to do with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| That's why we have fair housing laws in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| That's why we have to follow them as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| That's what makes our community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| So when I keep hearing the idea that we want a certain group or a certain age group over another group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| that seems specifically to talk about age, I think that's not only unfair, but it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| And I can't imagine that could be any basis for a decision that we would make on a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Next we have, I think, four individuals that want to talk on a subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| And no particular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| We'll start up here with, I've got Mary Wilson, Ryan Dupes, Jamie Dobbs, and Suzanne Dupes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| So if you would like to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Just state your name and address for the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| My name is Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| I live at 5208 Cayuga Drive in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| And I want to speak on the article that appeared on the front page of the paper last Tuesday, the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1464)|
| 0:24:34| concerning, Mr. Smith, your criticism of Amy Burrell as our commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| and her expenses in traveling to various places on behalf of our county citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| where she always learns new approaches, new ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| And then she comes back and shares them with her constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| And I reread the article this morning so that I would not misrepresent what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| Also in that article was a few little sentences about a trip that two other of the commissioners made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1508)|
| 0:25:18| along with a person not named but who was a pension expert of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| They apparently made a trip to Sonoma, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| to study different ideas about setting pensions or changing pensions for large groups that they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| And I did a little checking before I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| I know where Sonoma, California, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| It is 35 miles from Santa Rosa, which is the closest airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| It is 70 miles from San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| The cost of plane fare and then you would have to rent a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| We don't know how long these folks stayed in Sonoma or what they did while they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| And my question is when you all restudy this issue of transparency in travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| you need to compare the work that Amy Burrell is doing with other folks who make similar trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| And then the details were not supplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Therefore, you all, before you all can make any decisions on who's going to be allowed what travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| and where they're to go, you could have a more equitable formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| And the fact that you criticized her, and I know you just apologized for her working on women's issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| you might consider the fact that 51 percent of the voters in Knox County are women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| I don't know what the percentage is of Knox County employees, some who are heads of households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| and women are represented in the employees that you're going to be studying about their pensions and also teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1622)|
| 0:27:12| Most teachers in Knox County are female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Most of them are also heads of household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| So you have to consider that what Amy Burrell is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| not just attending conferences that specify women's issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| but she represents a good portion of all the county and city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| And I think further apologies would be in the best interest of us who represent her in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1667)|
| 0:27:56| Hi, my name is Wren Doops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| I live at 8632 Barbie Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| And I wanted to start by thanking you, Commissioner Smith, for your statement earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I wanted to come here today to talk about some of the statements that were made in the headlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| and everything else about Commissioner Boyle's recent trip to the summit put on by the Tennessee Economic Council on Women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| and also give some information about their report, the economic impact of violence against women in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| It's available on the commission's website, but I also have a copy here if any of you would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| Violence against women is a huge problem in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| In 2012, statewide, there were 64,697 crimes reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| These crimes are overwhelmingly instances of domestic violence, although prostitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| and sexual violence are also included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| In 2012, taxpayers paid $27,731,509.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| They spent that money funding local law enforcement agencies and jails to respond to these crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| When all services administered by government agencies and health care are taken into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| we spend more than $2.5 million a day responding to these crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| And it affects private businesses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| The broad estimate for the annual increase in insurance premiums due to intimate partner violence is $438 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1755)|
| 0:29:23| One in four women will be a victim of domestic violence, and only one in four of those report the crimes that happen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| Imagine the impact on our local government if more of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Those are the facts that are represented in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| And I'm not here to assert that you all don't care about women's issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| but given the recent press over Commissioner Boyle's attendance at this conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| I wanted to present you all with some of the information they received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| This information is obviously relevant to Knox County government, and I hope for conferences such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| that you all would gladly excuse a commissioner if they have the opportunity to receive training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| or information or skills that are obviously so valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Thank you, Ms. Dupes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Next, Jamie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| My name is Jamie Dobbs, and I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| I just want to say first that I've stepped down as the League of Women Voters President,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| so I just want to make sure you understand I'm speaking here as an individual and citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| I'd first like to commend, and I will say I'm here to speak to the issue of the training issue and transparency issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1841)|
| 0:30:51| and I just want to commend all of you commissioners who do attend workshops and trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| and who put out the effort to enrich your understanding of public policy issues that affect Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| and all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| You each have some unique insight, and you each set priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| You help to set priorities for this body and for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| But I would hope that if some issues, as you come in, as you're working through a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1881)|
| 0:31:30| if they surprise you that you don't rely on a small circle of local friends to guide you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| and instead rely occasionally on professional opinion that is gained from outside of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| I don't believe that anyone knows the future, but I do know that attending professional conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| and trainings, like most of my friends and colleagues do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| provides you with valuable insight into the expected challenges that you'll likely encounter in your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| And while I'm sure, Commissioner Smith, that you're very hardworking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| and you do understand many things about local politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| I don't believe elected officials are magically prepared to handle all of the challenges before they enter office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| As you were quoted as saying in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| most of my friends and colleagues were stunned to hear you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| We support the use of the travel budget for training, and it serves the citizens well if you develop specific expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| and share it for the benefit of us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| And that goes for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| I'll close by saying that I'm personally offended at the suggestion that following issues important to women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| is not vital to the well-being of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| And I did hear that you had apologized, Commissioner Smith, for that implication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| But I just want to be here to represent that there's many of us who could not get off work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| and come today and tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| But we are very, very interested in having all of you represent the issues that women encounter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1979)|
| 0:33:08| And we would, we just can't imagine how you would justify saying that decision makers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| in Knox County government shouldn't get involved in improving the fate of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| as Rendup's just said, a quarter of all women who are subjected to domestic violence during their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| And I will say I'm one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| These, this report that was, that came out through the commission for women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| or that you wouldn't want to consider the fate of pregnant teens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| or the cost of women and children's health issues or inequities in wages, all of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| Or I think, which I think is very important, the political leadership development of women who are shamefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2027)|
| 0:33:56| poorly represented in our public sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| We need more, not less, attention in this body to such issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| And I will tell you that people do pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| And people moving here pay attention to what is said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| And that, you know, being welcoming of those kinds of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| and being attentive is the kind of thing that can draw people here to our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| draw their money, draw their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| And it also, I will tell you, I know from personal knowledge, it sends them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| So I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2070)|

| 0:34:48| Commissioners, I want to offer just a few words on the discussion about tax dollars for travel to professional conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| and funding for members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| I am particularly interested in recent comments about training relevant to women's issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| and that it doesn't have any bearing on decisions here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Critical information relevant to all Knox County citizens was provided at the Tennessee Economic Summit for Women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| As a member of the Tennessee Economic Council Foundation Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| and the Board of the East Tennessee Women's Leadership Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I was incredibly pleased to see Commissioner Boyles at the hearing held by the Economic Council here in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| about the economic impact of violence against women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| The Tennessee Council determined that Tennessee spends $886 million annually as a result of violence against women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| This is a cost to taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| As our law enforcement officers respond, as our courts process cases, emergency rooms deal with trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| children are placed in the custody of child and family services, and on it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Each of you knows someone who has been impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Many of you know me, and I have been a victim of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| Most of you wouldn't have to look too far to find a woman you know who has been a victim of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| As you've heard, Knox County is 51.3 percent women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| If you extrapolate that number, some 56,600 women every year in Knox County are victims of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2167)|
| 0:36:17| The summit and the report also dealt with the issue of human sex trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| Knox County has an average 100 cases every year of sex trafficking involving a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| The average age of those minors is between 12 and 14 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| As our legislative body, you should be aware of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| I thank Commissioner Boyles for attending the summit to bring it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I strongly urge you to read the Economic Impact of Violence Against Women in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| This is new information just released in October that quantifies how taxpayers are impacted by women's issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2214)|

| 0:42:17| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2537)|

| 0:42:27| Item 42, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| I hear a motion to approve our line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| And properly seconded by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Item that's been added, the discussion regarding the school board meeting held last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| Is that Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| And if it's okay with members of the body, just defer that to Monday also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| And the last item added is a discussion regarding the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| We have our process in place for interviewing candidates for an internal audit position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2593)|
| 0:43:25| And I can't remember what date we're supposed to be meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| It's the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| To interview so that hopefully we will have something for you by Monday's commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| so that we can move forward with hiring someone as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| And it's a public meeting, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| And we invite all of the public and all commissioners to come Thursday morning at 9 o'clock if interested in your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| Really appreciate what the audit committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| You all do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Commissioner Rapp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Continuing on that line, it's Thursday morning at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| There were three candidates identified, and I'd like to take a moment of personal privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| and say that a fourth candidate will be added to the list because our resolution said three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2652)|
| 0:44:22| But we had a prior resolution that said if a qualified veteran was to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| and met all of the qualifications that they would be also interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| So there will be interviews of four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| And if it, Mr. Chairman, be proper for just one more moment, I'd like to make a couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| The first being that as we talk about surplus real estate in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| there's going to be an auction at 7128 Tazewell Pike for 2.88 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2694)|
| 0:45:04| I do not the date is sometime early in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I just saw the real estate auction sign posted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| That's important because last week there was also another auction here in Knox County selling or trying to sell a surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2712)|
| 0:45:23| property of the county from delinquent tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| The only reason I rise to say anything about that is because I'm a firm believer in the fact that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Knox County, do not need to retain property that we have no function for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| It's better in the hands of private citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| and would be better for Knox County if such be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| That's just my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| And then the last thing, but the most important thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| for those that do not have a copy of one of the local newspapers that is in a standout sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| if you'll look in the Section C, I think, about the second or third or last page on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| you'll see a distinguished employee of Knox County who is a displayer of photographed art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2763)|
| 0:46:12| And I'm sure he will be available there at the newsstand to sign and autograph such as the article is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| I believe it to be a glowing article on an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you, John Gustin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Give him a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Were you doing Commissioner Bratton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Refresh my memory again on the selection of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| The audit committee is going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Will they bring us a one recommendation or are they interviewing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| I just want to make sure I'm clear on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| We will be interviewing everyone on the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| And then our goal is to bring you a candidate, one candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| But the commission can choose to hire anyone they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| They don't have to go with the person that we recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| It would be really great if more commissioners could be here Thursday during the interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| And a sidelight to that, I think Commissioner Brown has asked for all 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| or however many applications there were he wanted to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| He personally wanted to see all of them, and I think he has had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Or at least I hope he has because I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| If he wanted to see them, he should see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Yes, we're doing announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| On your desk is a copy of the executive summary of the economic impact of violence against women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| which I brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| And every time I go to this conference, every year that I attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| they release a new study on the economic impact of some women's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| This year it's the violence against women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| And every time I come back, I always present this in a public forum and invite the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| And the date for that for this year is Monday, November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| And hopefully we will be in the classroom at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| That's at least the plan for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| So I hope that you'll take time to read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| and I hope that we'll have a good public forum discussing it on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| That was November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Since we have a lot of time today, apparently very short agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| I just mentioned to Amy that in terms of insolvency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| and I thought I'd just go ahead and make an announcement for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| and for the benefit of some of the people that have been involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| And Doug Battelle has been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And there's an item that involves tax issues in the Third Creek Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| and potentially a site that was a Civil War fort site that was possibly built by black soldiers in the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2939)|
| 0:49:13| And, anyway, this property is a difficult piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| It's landlocked and we have significant tax issues, back taxes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| So just want the insolvency board to be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| I'll bring, I'll ask Doug Battelle to possibly speak to the board on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| But it's a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| And I think, at the very least, everybody acknowledges that this piece of property should be preserved in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2979)|
| 0:49:48| And there's, you know, difficulties in terms of how to dispose of it and tax sale and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| But, anyway, just wanted them to be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Anything else that needs to be brought before the subcommittee here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| We'll adjourn from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And, Commissioner, is it your committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Yes, the insolvency board, we're going to take a ten-minute or nine-minute break, eight-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| We'll be back at three o'clock here in this room for the insolvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| It shouldn't take more than ten minutes to get through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131112?start=3016)|
