| 0:00:53| Please remain in silence for a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=53)|
| 0:01:08| Please remain in silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=71)|
| 0:01:26| Please remain in silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=86)|
| 0:01:57| Are there any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| Okay. Our law director is out there, Mr. Booth, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=124)|
| 0:02:14| Okay. So are there any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| So do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Okay. So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Babb. All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| So Ms. Babb will be doing our vision and mission spotlight tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| Sure. I wanted to talk about something that I think is real important to us, which is about the education of our students and obviously their goals for after school, after they finish with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=157)|
| 0:02:48| And I had the chance to talk to Chrissy D'Alejandro, head of Tennessee Achieves today, and I'm going to kind of give you a report on what she gave me, which I think is exciting news about what we're accomplishing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=168)|
| 0:02:59| Basically, in 2020, the state of Tennessee experienced a sharp decline in the percentage of students enrolling in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| This included four-year institutions, community colleges, and technical colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| While the state experienced a 6% point decline in its college-going rate, Knox County saw a 2% point increase in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=191)|
| 0:03:20| This is due, no doubt, to all the hard work of our teachers, counselors, and leaders who continue to encourage college pathways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| We also believe that implementation of Knox Promise, which was a $6.6 million investment from the Haslam Family Foundation, contributed to this growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=209)|
| 0:03:39| Knox Promise, which I think some of us went to the announcement that they did a couple of years ago about this, provides every Knox County graduate who enrolls at community and technical colleges, by way of Tennessee Promise, a proactive completion coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=219)|
| 0:03:51| Students who come from families earning less than $70,000 annually also have access to completion grant emergency aid funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| Knox Promise completion grants address food and housing insecurities, as well as supports like books, transportation, and computer costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=239)|
| 0:04:09| The marriage of the completion coach with additional funding has been a game-changer for our most vulnerable students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| I thought this was just kind of exciting news to see that while the state had seen a decline in post-high school enrollment, that we at Knox County had seen a jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=255)|
| 0:04:28| One other thing I'd like to highlight, I think several of us got invited, or we all got invited to the open house for the Kelly Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| Several of us got to go tour that, and it was just very exciting to see the opportunities for some of our students that are having trouble completing high school in the normal high school setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=276)|
| 0:04:46| I had actually learned about the school years ago when it was actually out at the mall, and it was kind of a very different setup where it was very computer-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| But at the open house, I really appreciated all the teachers that stayed that evening and met with us to kind of talk about how they really work on individual plans to get so many of these kids graduating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=295)|
| 0:05:05| because that really is our goal, to get all of these Knox County kids graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| So I think there were just some exciting things going on, and I just wanted to highlight those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| All right, and so, Superintendent Feldman, you have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I'd like to start by saying thank you to our families, students, and staff for their support as we work to implement the federal order reinstating face coverings inside our school facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=322)|
| 0:05:32| I am very appreciative of everyone's effort and the graciousness provided to our school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| However, I'd like to acknowledge that this federal order has presented some ongoing challenges at our school, and just to talk about a few of those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| And those include students who are not in class receiving regular classroom instruction, staff who are being pulled from their duties to supervise these students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| and bus driver vacancies that we had before the face mask order have been complicated by drivers who do not or refuse to wear face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=354)|
| 0:06:03| And we have students with medical issues through their IEPs or 504 plans but are not yet exempt from the federal order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| and we have certified and classified employees who have either resigned or are at home for refusal to wear a face mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| We're continuing to manage and monitor these situations as we work to comply with the federal order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| Also, I'd like to remind families that fall break is coming up soon, beginning on October 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| and tonight we are adding a new element to the superintendent's report at the suggestion of Vice Chair Ebony Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| and that would be a data moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| And this is an opportunity to highlight our district's priorities and initiatives by focusing on a particular number or set of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| Tonight I want to highlight a very important segment of data, which is the proficiency level we saw on last year's TCAP test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| As you know, our district worked very hard to offset the impact of COVID-19 during the 2021 school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| but like many districts across the state, we did see student proficiency drop significantly in most subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| And as superintendent, I want us to be laser focused on bouncing back from learning loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| and helping our students regain any academic ground that they may have lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And to do that, I think we need to have a very clear view of the challenges we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| As I conclude my remarks, I would like to invite Steve Rutter, who's already up at the podium there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| and ask him to provide some more details about our TCAP results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And again, the data moment tonight is just a brief summary of the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| and just would like to invite the board, if you want more detailed information about these data reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| that maybe that's something we put on workshop where we can devote a little bit more time to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| So at this time, Madam Chair, members of the board, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Thank you, Mr. Thomas, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| I appreciate the invitation to come speak with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| And what we decided to talk about for our census of the data moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| actually, I practiced this before I came and it took me 25 minutes, but I promise I narrowed it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| So what we decided to talk about was student achievement, or sometimes you'll hear it called student proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| They're kind of interchangeable terms out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| And so what I'm talking about tonight is a real high level view of that, and it's the combined proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| And when I say that, what I mean is we're talking about all subjects, math, English, science, social studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| and all grade levels aggregated together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| So most of these three slides that I have, the charts on them are stacked bar charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| So if you're rusty on your charts and aren't used to looking at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| each segment represents a performance category on the TCAP exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| The state classifies each student's performance in one of four categories, the highest being mastered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| the next one is on track, and both of those categorizations are considered proficient in grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| or subject standards on the TCAP test that they attempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| And then the other two that aren't considered proficient are approaching and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| So for the stacked bar chart, each of these colored segments represents a portion of our test results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| for each of the last four testing cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| And the width of the segments are to scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| So wider segments mean a larger portion of our students fall into that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| Narrower segments mean that fewer number of our students fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| So what we're really interested in here tonight is mostly the blue and green categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| The blue is mastered, green is on track, yellow is for approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| and the red is for our students that scored in the below category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| So when I look at this initial chart, these are all the test results aggregated together, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| for each of the last four testing cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| So the first thing that, when I look at this chart, that sticks out to me is there's a year missing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| So that was because state testing was suspended in 2020, so there are no results for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| The other thing that kind of strikes me when I look at this data is that, you know, from 2017 to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| the width of the green and blue segments don't vary very much at all across the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| So, in fact, when I went back and looked at more testing history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| sort of that average amount of change that we typically see from year to year is about 1% either way, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| So as a district, like, it moves, but it's at a glacial pace kind of a lot of times, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| So, and I say that, I bring that up because if you look at the last bar, our test results from 2021 and compared to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| and you add up the blue and green segments, what you'll see is our proficiency overall dropped 3.9% compared to the last testing cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=651)|
| 0:11:01| So 3.9%, when you say it out loud, doesn't really sound like a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| but when you consider the context, it's quite a large shift, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| So my main takeaway from this graph, this chart, is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| there were just a lot of challenges that happened over the last couple of years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| They were out of schools' controls, teachers' control, superintendents' control, everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| that likely had very negative impacts on student achievement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| So the next slide is the same sort of information divided up into our, well, not all of them, but four of our ethnic and racial groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| These four ethnic and racial groups comprise about 99% of our student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| We do have very small percentages of Native American and Pacific Islander students, but they aren't represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| So when I look at these groups of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| the first thing that stands out is when I look at the Asian group is that they have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| you look at the mastered and on-track segments of their stacked bar charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| like their level of achievement is much higher than any of these other groups, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| So from 2017 to 2019, the average achievement for that group was 71%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| but even so, like if you look at the last chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| you'll see that the width of the green and blue bars, on-track and mastered, shrunk a little, shrunk, and it shrunk 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| So this group of students, like experience, that's the largest single drop of any group of students that we track was this Asian group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| So if you look at the next group over, the African, our African American students, in, you know, 2018, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=756)|
| 0:12:45| their proficiency was 18%, and they saw a 3% drop last year compared to the year prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| A similar kind of story with our Hispanic students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| And this one, this one is kind of a shame to me because if you, if you look at the on-track and mastered segments for our Hispanic students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| they were kind of marching up, like from 2017 to 2018 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| And then the pandemic happened and they lost all that progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| I mean, we're talking about a group, different group of students, but it's back to 23%, the same thing it was in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| So, and then our white students, the last couple of years, the proficiency rate on all subjects was 46% and they saw a decline of 3% in that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=800)|
| 0:13:31| So, again, you know, the thing that, the thing that I take away from this slide is nobody was safe from the pandemic, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| So, we saw, we saw declines in each one of these categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| The other thing that's really noticeable on this chart is there's a really wide variation in student performance across these, these groups, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=823)|
| 0:13:53| If you compare, compare the Asian students' proficiency rates to the white students, to the African American, to the Hispanic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| there's big, big academic achievement gaps in there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| So, and on the last slide, there are three groups of students on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| We, I labeled it accountability groups, but because these are the groups we track through our accountability system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| And these groups of students are probably our most academically fragile students that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| And you can kind of see that with the proficiency rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| So, for our economically disadvantaged students, they, you know, they, last couple of years in 17, 18, 18, 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| they had a proficiency rate of about 19% and they experienced a 3% decline in proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| English language learners is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Like they, they were 19% proficient in 18, 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| They actually dipped just 1% in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| And then our students with disabilities is the group that kind of bucked the trend, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| They, they had a 10% proficient in 2019 and then it actually went up 1% in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| So, again, so two out of these three, these three groups of students, we saw declines in proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| So, again, it was, it's one of those things that I just think that all the challenges with the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| just had negative impacts on our overall student proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| I think I was kind of noticing in all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| I mean, there's obviously drops, but like the green actually seems pretty consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| It's actually on the blue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| So, it's almost like our kids, it's, it's not that they're just even slipping to, you know, it's, you're slipping out of the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| But I mean, the green bar almost seems pretty consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Most of the things are actually at the top where we seem to have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| Well, I think, I think it's everybody, everybody slid down a little bit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| And so the kids that were in the green, some of the ones on the edge of the green dipped into the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| And I think, yeah, I think that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| So, the other, the other point I was going to make about that last slide, if we can get it back up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Was that, you know, it's kind of hard to, academic achievement gaps for those last three groups are kind of hard to see in that last slide because the comparison groups aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=971)|
| 0:16:21| So, like the economically, for example, the economically disadvantaged students, last year their proficiency rate was 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| If you compare that to the non-economically disadvantaged students, whose proficiency rate was 43%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| I mean, that's, they're three times, their proficiency rate's three times what the non, what the economically disadvantaged students are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| So, there's some, there's some pretty big achievement gaps that we, we, we monitor and we take, try to take action to help, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1001)|
| 0:16:53| And that's it for me. Thank you all. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Thanks, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Thank you, Madam Chair. Awesome. Thank you so much and thank you Superintendent Thomas for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| My goal board for doing that is just to have us have discussion about our students, our student outcome and student growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| If we want to dive deeper into it, then we can have work sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| But I would like to see at all of our board meetings to talk about student, student progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| So, that was the first implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| But the goal is to, if we need to dive deeper into it, then let's have a work session about it versus here in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| So, thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| I appreciate that because I think if we actually keep seeing the numbers, it keeps our focus on it and it keeps, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| I know our staff sees these numbers a lot. I think we don't see it as much. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| And I would agree and thank you, Mr. Rutter and Superintendent Thomas and Ms. Satterfield for that fabulous suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| So, before we begin our discussion, the backup detail on item 10A regarding employee health insurance premiums has been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1072)|
| 0:18:05| Everyone saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| And also, since we invited Tammy Grissom from the Tennessee School Board Association and Matt Myers from Knox County Procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| to join us tonight for discussion and questions about the upcoming superintendent search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| I would like to move the discussions on that item to the front, if everybody's okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1098)|
| 0:18:26| Oh, but first, sorry, we have a concept briefing for Western Heights redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| And I think Mr. Oaks, no, he's not here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Ms. Renee, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| I'm not Mr. Oaks, but I have the pleasure this evening of introducing Mr. Ben Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| He's the executive director and CEO of KCDC and Dr. Marissa Mozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| How'd that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| And she is over strategic partnerships and she is the policy director at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1136)|
| 0:19:05| They are here with us this evening to discuss the proposed Western Heights redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| And so I will gladly turn this microphone over to the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you so much, Ms. Kelly. Thank you, board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| And thank you, superintendent, for allowing us to speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| I promise we'll be very concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| I just want to introduce KCDC a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| I'm sure y'all are familiar with the work we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| But we house about 20,000 individuals in Knox County at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| About half of those are through what would be considered traditional public housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| so physical housing sites like Western Heights that we're here to talk about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Another half of those through our Housing Choice Voucher Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| which are privately owned units spread across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Part of what we do beyond just housing families is we look at neighborhoods and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| how can we utilize the reinvestment in housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| but also other factors that create family and child success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| For instance, investments in education, investments in workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| How do we look at all those things to create a plan for a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| that's really going to create a thriving neighborhood and thriving families for years to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| So right now, we've been working with the community over the last nine months to look at Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Are y'all generally familiar with Western Heights and Beaumont?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| All right, we're going to show a map in a minute, so if you're not, it'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And I'm going to turn it over to Marissa Mawazin to talk to y'all a little bit about the planning process to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| where we're at, and then I'm sure y'all are interested in how this plan is going to impact and coordinate with education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| So we're going to make some specific points around that, and if y'all have any questions, we'll be happy to take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| Thanks, y'all. Marissa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you. So y'all should have a briefing book in front of you, so I'm just going to walk through that book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| What we're doing is we're actually combining with the city and filing a joint application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| for what's called the Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| That implementation grant is a $30 million award that HUD will make to cities around the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| They'll make five to six awards a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| That grant really is focused on not just housing, on improving housing in an area, but people in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| So it's combining all three of those objectives together to lift an entire section of a neighborhood or a city at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| And so that's what we're applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| And the NOFO hasn't come out yet. It should come out in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| So we've been working on this for about a year to look at what could be done in the Western Heights-Beaumont area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| to help the residents that live in that neighborhood, not just in KCDC housing, but the neighborhood overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| We spent the past few months, as I said, going through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| It's a four-phase process that you see in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| The first step is to build a Head Start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| That is a neighborhood that needs early childhood education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| About 43% of the residents on our property alone on the KCDC Western Heights property are children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| That's a big chunk with having about 800 residents there with 43% being kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| So we're building a Head Start, a 132-seat Head Start in partnership with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| And we actually broke ground on that just a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Ms. Kelly came and helped us dig some dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| The next phase will be a renovation of the 1930s housing that's on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| That will be a substantial exterior renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| We've recently renovated the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| The next step will be a lot of vacant land that will be converted to both non-housing and housing purposes that I'll highlight in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| And then the fourth phase, we're actually going to tear down all the 1950s housing that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Unfortunately, they didn't build as well in the 1950s as they did in the 1930s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| So that housing just unfortunately has not stood the test of time and needs to be redone so the residents have a quality place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| As you can see, the neighborhood boundary there, so when we talk about choice neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| our neighborhood boundary for investment is that entire green map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| So everything from Tennessee to Beaumont to 275 to Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Our KCDC-owned land is that pink area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| The dark pink is our target area, the light that will be newly constructed, and the light pink is the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| Beaumont Elementary does fit into this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| It is located on the map in the bottom, right actually where it says Avenue, that gray topped building is Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| Beaumont is the school that serves this neighborhood in terms of elementary school primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| All of that neighborhood also fits in Census Track 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| So there's a lot of data available on that Census Track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| So we've been doing the process for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Choice neighborhoods is very dependent on neighborhood input and resident input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| So all of the ideas that we've come up to date are actually based on the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| You'll see there, there's a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| We've been doing online Zoom meetings with residents due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| So thanks to some funding from the city, we handed out 200 tablets to residents so they could participate in Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| And we do two a month since February to get community input on what this plan needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| And we've also held neighborhood meetings as well, in-person meetings with mailers going out to all of those households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| And through that, we did a needs assessment as well with the residents in addition to the online and in-person meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| And all of that came to this resident summary slide that really shows what residents are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| And residents in this neighborhood are no different than any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| They want a safe neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| They want quality schools for their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| They want transportation options, activities, programming, all of that great stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| So that's really what our plan is driven around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| In addition to that, we have 15 stakeholder groups that have about 100 nonprofits and other organizations across the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1466)|
| 0:24:36| And we have an education stakeholder group, an early childhood education stakeholder group, and an adult education stakeholder group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| And we invited all the principals from the schools to attend and really share their input of what this community could benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| And then help us to interpret the data that came from residents of how we could address resident needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| So all of that really boils down into this plan of these goals that you see in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| Really on the people plan, the education one is the reason why we're here tonight is to share that education goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| That is part of one of HUD's requirements is for us to partner extensively with the county school system or the city school system in the place that you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1506)|
| 0:25:16| And look at improving education outcomes at the target schools where these children attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| And so that's what we've been working together with the principals, with the school leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| And now we're here today just to share this preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| For youth development in this area, we're going to extend our Boys and Girls Club that's located there, add an addition on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Hopefully through philanthropic dollars that we raise to provide additional supports for youth and teens in the area to give them a place to congregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| Currently that facility can serve 40. They want to serve 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| And we're also going to have a neighborhood anchor zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| So we're going to have a new commercial center in that area that's being built on the vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| That's going to incorporate job training, arts and innovation spaces, workforce development, a senior space, health care spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| And really the arts and maker space that the community asked for playing off of Beaumont Elementary and their arts magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| That is going to be the focal point of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| That the community really asked for more arts and innovation opportunities and entrepreneurship opportunities at the micro level, at the individual household level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| And so that's what this whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| And I'm going very, I know you have a long agenda tonight, so this is a very brief briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| If you need more in depth, we are happy to meet with you one on one to talk about the plan in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And there's a picture there of what the park, what the location looks like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Then you have the artist's rendition of what that area will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| And we have an agreement, we've talked with the city, who's agreed to look at putting Knoxville's first regional destination park on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1601)|
| 0:26:50| That park could include very large playgrounds and playscapes, hillside climbing structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| very akin to what a grown up shoots and ladders game would look like, because this is a very hilly site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| As well as the neighborhood asked for a playground and a splash pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And so we're looking at all those options for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| The other thing they wanted was a safe walking path to Beaumont Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| So if you have not ever walked to Beaumont Elementary before, the kids actually, there's no sidewalks on some of these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| So they're walking down an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And they walk down the alley to go to school the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| And the school system did like the alley and found funding to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Because it does get dark in some of the mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| So trying to make it as safe as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| But the school system can't build roads and sidewalks and really improve all of the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| And so what we're proposing is to actually take some of our land and put a safe walking path to Beaumont through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| So that's one of the options we're looking at and that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| And that's kind of seen on that neighborhood plan there with Beaumont being in the purple with the green in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| So from the school system, when this grant comes due, what we're doing is we're still having our ongoing planning meetings of what makes sense for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| And we're currently capturing all the programming and activities that currently go on in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| Especially those that are targeted at helping improve test scores and scores of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Because HUD's going to look for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| When we are selected for a site visit and we become a finalist for the grant, they will come and the school system will actually give the school presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1693)|
| 0:28:22| It won't be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| And they will look for the school system being heavily invested in improving the scores of these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| I've mentioned Beaumont a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| The other schools that our target residents attend are Northwest Middle and Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| But in that boundary map, children that live in that boundary that I showed you also attend Lonsdale Elementary, Westfield Elementary, Maynard Elementary, Bearden Middle, and West High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1715)|
| 0:28:45| So just in that one mile, two mile zone, you have that many schools represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| So we're looking at all the investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| And we're also going to work with the school district to see if there's interest in new programming in some of those schools to increase test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| That's going to look really good to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| I mentioned the $30 million grant that we're going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| We're actually going to pair that with about $110 million of local investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| So in terms of project scope, it's a big project in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| So we're hoping the school system will be able to be a good partner and really step forward and help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| And the other thing we wanted to present because we know it's important to you is the projected increase in children in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| I mentioned 43% of our particular site is children, which is about 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| It's exactly 338 children right now on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| We will, by the time we are done with full leasing as well as adding the additional units that we need to add because of this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1775)|
| 0:29:44| we are currently projecting about 737 children on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| That's a low estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| That's a conservative estimate because we can't control what happens in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| There are over 100, 200 vacant lots right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| Actually, there's 338 vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| And not all of them are buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| About half of those are buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| If all of those come back with buildable homes that have children as well, this number will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| But that is a concern that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| When we shared our plan as well as the additional construction that will happen for multifamilies on this site of the capacity of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1814)|
| 0:30:25| I know that was really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| And we have in-depth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| I could talk for an hour of all the great things that are going to happen on this site with all the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Are there any questions for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I'm not sure who would answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| It's probably somebody with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Do you know what capacity we have right now at Beaumont?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| And I know Russ is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Does Ms. Kelly have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Ms. Kelly has that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| I have Mr. Oaks' prepared statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| So thank you for asking, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Our preliminary analysis of the proposed Western Heights redevelopment indicates that the expected additional student yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| will stress the current Beaumont Elementary School facility beyond its capacity, which you alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| As we examine this more closely, it is highly likely that we will find it necessary to propose a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| with greater capacity to be built in the fiscal year 2026-2027 timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| An addition to the current school may be possible, but the constrained nature of the current campus will drive the feasibility of this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1884)|
| 0:31:34| And might I add anything beyond that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I will communicate directly to Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Let me answer that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| We'll get you that number or get the board that number in terms of current capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| I know Rule High School is sort of in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I know it's not right in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Is there any talks of looking at that property if we're going to need an elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| I still don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| We mentioned that when we've had our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| I love to speak when I know nothing on the subject, so here I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Yeah, so the county had put out an RFP for the Rule site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| I think they're going through the process of evaluating those proposals from a private development standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| Obviously, that site was a school in the past, so it seems like something that could be considered in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| If there was a little more fidelity around—I love the fact that there's a year attached to the statement that was made by Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| If there was fidelity and a bit of commitment, we could look at—I mean, there's a lot of land in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| Trying to identify a site for a future school, if that was something that the school board wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| But, you know, buildable land is a commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Just to constrain an area six or seven acres without knowing something's going to happen there would be a tough ask, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| Hearing this, I just hope we as a school system are being proactive about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| Obviously, Rule has been a high school. I have driven past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| It does not look like a usable building itself, but obviously there's a lot of land there, but as you said, there's other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| So, I just hope that we're having conversations with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| If we're seeing this as a concern, coming up fairly quickly, it sounds like, if everything goes through like y'all say, which I guess we're all very hopeful it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| it sounds like a great opportunity, but it kind of makes us look at the school system as I do think we need to be working hand-in-hand on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| to make sure that we can accommodate the students that might be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Just a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| You mentioned 338 vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Is that all within this particular area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| That is within the neighborhood boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| So, the slide that has the pink small section, that is Western Heights, and then the broader green section is the neighborhood boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| Right. So, within that green section total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Yeah, that's tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I see that the application is due in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| And the reason for my question, I'm thinking about if the Beaumont building would be stressed, I'm thinking about time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| When do you suggest or when are you projecting these units would be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| So, we are working closely with Mr. Oaks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| So, our development team right now, these will come on in phases of roughly 100 to 150 units at a time per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| I mean, that's a very rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So, it won't happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| It's really good that we're having the conversation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| But we can get, obviously, the graph that shows the increase in students, that's roughly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| Like you can see, we're sitting at 338 students in that area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| Year one stays flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| But year two, we'll have a project come online, and you can see it ramp up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Year one, I mean, that's 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I mean, what is the year one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Yeah, I think year one would be 2022, and year two, 23, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| You mentioned timeline for the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| You will see the HUD requires a letter of commitment from the school that's voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| So, I know the school system is putting together a list of current projects that go on at these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| So, you will see that come through, hopefully, on your agenda in November or December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Once we get the timeline from HUD, when they actually issue the RFP, we'll be able to project that a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Just a last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| If any of us wanted to hear more detail and learn more about the project, what's the best way to go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| Just, yeah, reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I'm happy, or Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Chris can set it up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Yeah, we would love to meet one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Marissa's got, like, a three-hour presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Thanks, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| So, I think Matt Myers is here from Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| So, at our annual workshop last week, people had some questions about the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Should we move forward with the superintendent search with an outside firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| So, he is here to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Or could you just briefly maybe describe what that process is and the timeline for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| My name is Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| I'm the Procurement Director for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Really quickly, I'll just go through the RFP process, if that's the process that you all chose to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| It's used when an award is not to be based solely on the lowest price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| We develop significant evaluation factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| And these are just, you know, things that I thought of today, the qualifications of a firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| experience of their personnel, their methodology and how they go about selecting candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| delivery schedule, references, price, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| And you can choose any or all others that, you know, may be more important to you all as we go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2232)|
| 0:37:22| Once you determine those, we obviously add a weighting factor to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| Price is not the determining factor in an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| In that process, you're looking at proposal against proposal on a qualitative basis, not necessarily a cost basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2252)|
| 0:37:41| Evaluation committee members, user department personnel, individuals with project responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| personnel with technical familiarity with project requirements, procurement division representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| This also allows you to have discussions and presentations from those proposals that are acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2275)|
| 0:38:05| A lot of times what we'll do, and after 23 years it's always held true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| there's always a natural break, you know, whether that's at number two or three or five or seven or however many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| There's a natural break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| And a lot of times where that natural break falls, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| we may call those individual firms in or companies or whatever the case may be and let them do a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Let us ask questions of the evaluation committee to ask questions of those firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| so we can clarify what they have put on paper and what we're understanding they're telling us they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| Looking at a time frame, this is a 21-day, 21 business day on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| I would not suggest shortening this any form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| This is too important of a decision to try to shorten that and rush things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| We would set a deadline for questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| At the closing time, only those who have submitted, we will read those names aloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| Evaluations will proceed as expeditiously as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| The short list, as I mentioned, will be created and given an opportunity to come in and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| Once those are done, final evaluations are completed, turned in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| awards made to the highest evaluated proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| That's what's required by our procurement regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| So let's do contract documents after that, negotiate those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| and then obviously seek BOE and commission approval for that firm to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| Just ironic, we had RFP 3088 closed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| 3088 was executive search services for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| We had two respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| One was local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| One was from Plano, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| We were specifically asking for health care experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Everybody's heard that Dr. Buchanan is retiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| so we reached out and did an RFP to find a search firm to help us search for two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| One is the senior director of public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| The other one is the public health officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| We additionally requested assistance in a compensation analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| with comparable-sized counties, municipalities, as Knoxville is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| As always, in every RFP, bid, RFQ, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| we always reserve the right to not make an award for whatever reason that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| And I will entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| Ms. Bass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Yeah, I have a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| If we decided to go the RFP route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| how do you all put it out there to the world of people to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| We do have a database, but when we were doing our search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| we looked at LinkedIn, Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| We did everything we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| We found the 25 top search firms that were listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| And we actually contacted them and said, hey, we're going to have an RFP out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| We'd love for you to get registered, get in the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| If you want to propose, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| We're open to looking at other firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| I'm not just looking at what's in my database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| We don't do this often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| It's not like electricians or plumbers or contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| So my database may be a little small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So I'm open to contacting anybody anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| My other question is, when they're reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| and obviously that point system is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| is there anyone from the school system involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| That's what I wasn't clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Who is that that's actually doing that ranking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| You know, I just came up with, it says use your department personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| These are out of the procurement regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Use your department personnel, individuals with project responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| We're not doing a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| We're doing a search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| So it's, you know, similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| And, you know, personnel with technical familiarity and project requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So, I mean, you can have, I always like to keep them as small as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| before we do schedules and, you know, have so many people in a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| But, you know, we could, you know, do five, you know, school personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| I'll yield to the law department on, you know, a board of education member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| or members being on there as you're evaluating a group of proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| We're going to make a recommendation of award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| and then you're going to vote on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| I don't know if there's a conflict in that chain of events, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| but, you know, that's something we can look at in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| I guess my question is, it's not a set, this person, this person, this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| That can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| You said you just completed the 3088.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Is that correct, that it was just awarded, the health department one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| It closed today at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| In terms of being on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| 21 business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| So that's a month and a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| So with that being on the street that long, what could we, for all the other steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| what could we reasonably expect in terms of a range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I mean, if it's out on the street 21 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| from the time it first went out to the time that it might close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| I know it's hard to say for certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| but is there a range of time that you would feel comfortable articulating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| I will tell you, Mr. Watson, it's at least a 60-day process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| At least a 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| 60 business days or 60 calendar days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I'll say calendar days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| You know, we have our evaluation ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| our evaluation committee is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| You know, would I have liked to have gotten more than two responses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Again, another very important hire for the county on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| Very important hire for you all on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| But, you know, it's a minimum of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| And then with schedules and things like that, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| everything used to be in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| We can do virtual meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| I'm not to help move things along and keep things rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you, Mr. Meyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| One thing real quick, if I may, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Mr. Thomas, Superintendent, Bob, I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| I'm not in front of you all often enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| That's probably a good thing, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| If I'm up here, then we may have a problem or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| for the education of our students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| How many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Starting in 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| I don't believe there's a person in this room, in that A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| or in all of Knox County, who has devoted their life to education like you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I hope you and your lovely wife have a wonderful retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you so much, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| It's been just a pleasure working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Pleasure working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Pleasure working with you in the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| You all do a terrific job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| So thank you for all the service you've provided to us for over the years too, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| And I think Ms. Grissom is here from PSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2723)|
| 0:45:33| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Can you just kind of give us, to start with, a brief overview of how PSBA does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| You can't hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2748)|
| 0:46:07| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2767)|
| 0:46:18| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Do the board members have a copy of our search packet in front of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2779)|
| 0:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| So I'm not sure what all you all discussed, and I don't want to repeat a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| but we have two plans that we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Our first plan does not involve any community or employee input meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| It's $6,500 is our plan one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| And that is where the board develops the criteria of what they're looking for in a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| They give us the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| We develop the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| We send the brochure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| We collect all the applications and resumes through our office, through an online portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| We screen the applicants, and then we submit the finalists to the board to interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| We develop the interview questions for the board if they choose to use our sample interview questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| Our questions are directly related to the criteria that the board adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Once we submit the finalists to the board, it's up to the board to interview those finalists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and then afterwards we can help with contract negotiations, salary analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| whatever the board needs from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Plan two is $11,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| This plan involves us going and conducting employee community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| gathering input from students, teachers, faculty, staff, administrators, the mayor, the county commission, city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2871)|
| 0:48:05| And we conduct these meetings and ask three questions at each of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| They're all conducted the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| They're one-hour meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| We ask each group, what are the good things that are going on in Knox County that you'd like to see continued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| Two, what are the problems or challenges a new superintendent will face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| And then three, what are the personal characteristics you'd like to see in a superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| We compile those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| We don't take individual names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| We just compile those comments from each of the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| And then from that, we develop the criteria, what we think we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| And I also interview the board members of what they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| And then we bring to the board a set of proposed criteria for the new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| The board either edits, revises with additions or deletions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| And then we pick back up where plan two started with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| We develop the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| We send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| We collect all the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| We do all the correspondence with the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Everyone on the board will have to deal with that legwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| We basically work for the board and do the legwork for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| We don't make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| We don't pick the candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| We just screen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2959)|
| 0:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| Do you have a question, Beth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Does TSBA have dedicated staff to handle this kind of process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2978)|
| 0:49:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| Board member Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| How long does the community input take for you guys, that portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=2999)|
| 0:50:08| We schedule one day, and we schedule all the meetings in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| And then it will take our staff a few days to compile the results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| and then we schedule a meeting back at the board to present that and the proposed criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3016)|
| 0:50:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| What was your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Christy, we didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| She was asking if we decided to go with TSBA, is TSBA prepared to start immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3040)|
| 0:50:50| She said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Do both options include national searches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| We're part of the National Association of Superintendent Searchers, which involves every state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| So once we send it out, it goes to everyone across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3067)|
| 0:51:17| Oh, I didn't do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Board member Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| If we wanted a longer community process or a more extensive community process, could we have more than one day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| If we wanted a longer community process or a more extensive community process, could we have more than one day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3093)|
| 0:51:43| I'm not sure what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| I mean, why do we need longer than a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| We have a sample community schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| I'm not sure if you're wanting a lot more groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| I don't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Well, we always, and I forgot to mention this, do a community forum in the evenings for everyone that couldn't make the other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3119)|
| 0:52:14| So typically, we'll have a meeting that will include the central office and principals together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| We obviously have the teachers by themselves, and we suggest a luncheon that would include the mayor, the county commission, business and community leaders all in one group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3141)|
| 0:52:32| So we have groups, and we can do as many groups as you want, but typically we can get every group that you want in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3152)|
| 0:52:45| Board member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| I just wanted to point the board's attention to an e-mail that Tammy responded to earlier in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| I had sent about 11 technical questions to her in advance, some numbers and things like that, and so those responses you all have in your e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3174)|
| 0:53:04| And Tammy, I really appreciate you doing that and taking the energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Around the community process, is it always in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Do you have an opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| I mean, do you all ever do anything virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Is there a survey that's a part of it, or is it just live in-person gatherings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| I heard him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Yes, we do these meetings in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| There's also a survey that we ask folks to fill out that has characteristics of a superintendent, such as do you want someone with a financial background or school, you know, various.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3209)|
| 0:53:41| I think there's about 23 characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| So we ask folks to fill that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| But we also, those three questions that I just mentioned, we have an online form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| So for those folks that cannot make one of the meetings in person, they can answer the questions online and also complete that survey online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3233)|
| 0:54:03| So we have every option for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| If you can't make an in-person meeting, then you'll have that community form that night you could attend, or you can do the online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3246)|
| 0:54:33| Okay, she was asking Tammy if an organization like KEF, Knoxville Education Foundation, who has helped us before with some community gathering sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3273)|
| 0:55:00| if we could use them to maybe get additional input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| And then build it into whatever's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| And I guess what I'm taking from this is we've all talked a lot about, because people weren't all at our workshop last week, that we all found that community input's very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3310)|
| 0:55:22| I think that's what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| I think the community input is important, and I've been at the association for 32 years, so I've done a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3326)|
| 0:55:34| I think that the process that we have, we can work with anyone you're talking about, but you need to be mindful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| I'm not sure what all the questions you're wanting to ask from the community, but I think you need to keep it to, you know, those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| I think you need to keep the meetings to an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| We're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| We're not at these meetings to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| We're not there to talk about any employee or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| It is strictly we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| The board wants your input on our new superintendent, and that's why we keep those questions to those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| And it's worked very effectively with other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| So, I mean, I'm happy to talk with the foundation if you're wanting them to do the community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| That's totally up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| We can assist you in whatever manner, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Board Member Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Yes, so if we, you know, next week is a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| If we decided to go with TSBA, how long do y'all see the process from, like, when we say, yes, we're hiring you, to having candidates to review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3392)|
| 0:56:43| What's your typical time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| That is totally up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| We used to, before you had the days of Internet and email, we would say, you know, at least six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| But we can do it in less time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| We can make it longer if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| I find that there's no reason to make it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| Once we develop the vacancy brochure, with a click of a button, it's going to go out within a few seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| And, you know, we can make the advertising period as long as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Most folks that are looking for superintendent jobs know to come to the State School Boards Association website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| So we can make this search whatever time frame that you want to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| So whenever you want someone on board, that's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| We work backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| You tell us when you want the superintendent to assume the position, and then we develop a timeline working back from that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3464)|
| 0:57:54| Board Member Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| I just want to confirm, so the board can pick the community leaders for input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| I didn't hear her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3486)|
| 0:58:14| Yeah, that's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| You all decide who you want to invite to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| That's totally up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| We'll help you draft an invitation that would come from the board chairman saying, you know, we've set aside this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| But, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| The list of who you invite is up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| So, Tammy, one of my concerns has been if we just if we put this on list serves, then what we're doing is we're asking people to come find it who are looking for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3517)|
| 0:58:49| Do you all, for lack of a better word, do you all do any type of head hunting where you say we know that this person fits the bill, but they may not be clicking on our link?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3529)|
| 0:58:59| Does that make sense what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Yes, we do recruit if we know of someone that we think would meet the criteria that the board adopts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| We also at each of the community meetings and we also ask each of the board members, if you know of someone that you would like for us to reach out to, to apply for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3549)|
| 0:59:20| We take those names and we send letters to those folks and say, you know, you've been recommended to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| Please submit your information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| We do recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| You all mentioned that there is a, you all will filter and then give us the top candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| Will, in that filtering process, will you reach, are you all transparent with the reasons why individuals did not move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3581)|
| 0:59:55| I would talk to individual board members about reasons we did not choose a particular candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| For obvious reasons, I'm not going to state those in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3601)|
| 1:00:11| Board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Board member Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Can Mr. Dupler address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Because I remember in the last superintendent search, hiring practices, we are not allowed to tell applicants why they were not selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3617)|
| 1:00:31| Or am I missing something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| I thought that that was kind of part of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Well, my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Well, maybe that's a Scott Bolton question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| I just remember dealing with our other HR person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| And while board members might have known, there's a whole other issue about informing candidates about their not knowing or not speaking to why they were not selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3644)|
| 1:00:57| And maybe I'm wrong or maybe my memory doesn't serve me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| And I want to clarify before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| It was, that question was, would you share with the board as to why candidates, not public, but to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| Well, I just meant to, yeah, to the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| So they could share with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| But, Tammy, they could share with the board, but not to the candidates legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| Whoever can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Mr. Dupler, Mr. Bolton, Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Madam Chair, I'm happy to try it and then let, I'll let Gary go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I think what you're talking about when you get into that point, you open yourself up to some potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| It's just a practice to mitigate risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| You know, in terms of someone filing a failure to hire claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| But I'll turn it over to Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| No, no, I think that's fair, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I mean, you know, what, so what happens is, I mean, you know, this board doesn't want to go into a huge amount of detail about why we didn't pick that person, why we didn't pick that person, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3707)|
| 1:01:57| Now, all these records are going to be public, as was discussed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| So if somebody wants to go and look at those records, then they can look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| But this board is best not declaring, okay, this is why we didn't pick this person or that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| I mean, you know, you all just need to get a list of your top candidates at some point and then just discuss, you know, why you like this person or that person out of those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3732)|
| 1:02:25| I understand that, and it could just be just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| But I know that we're mitigating risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| It's more so the filter process, if we were to go to TSBA, versus the candidates that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| And so while we're mitigating risks on the lawsuit end, I want to see what can we do to mitigate bias from the filter process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| And so that is where the question is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| But I don't know if there's an answer or not, so maybe that's something we can create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3772)|
| 1:03:02| To that point, Ms. Satterfield, I did ask Tammy if they offer anti-bias hiring training through their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| They don't, but I think that's something we could contract out, do another service to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3790)|
| 1:03:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Come back over here, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3811)|
| 1:03:45| So, Mr. Watson, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Well, it's to the same discussion, but it wasn't for Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| So at our retreat, one of the things that was brought up is that KEF said that they could possibly help support hiring a firm and potentially funding a firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3836)|
| 1:04:06| And we know recently they've helped us with our community engagement process around ESSER with NIET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| And that obviously did not have to go through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| So I was wondering if Mr. Dupler could speak to what are some of the potential challenges of us going that route for this type of thing when we've done it in the past for other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3855)|
| 1:04:28| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| The biggest challenge would be that, as was mentioned last week, hiring a superintendent is one of the most important things that a board of education can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3870)|
| 1:04:40| Under state law, it is the board of education's duty and right to hire a superintendent or director of schools, as it's called in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| So the board needs to avoid any type of conflict or certainly any kind of direct issue that shows that it's not intentionally, but in some way avoiding its duty and right to hire the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3889)|
| 1:05:11| What do I mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| I mean that this board has adopted through the charter this procurement process through the Knox County Procurement Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3912)|
| 1:05:22| So not using that could raise big questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| But however, as was discussed last week, there are other ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| The board could take it on of its own accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Or since the board is already a member of TSBA and that's been vetted through various state regulations and through the attorney general, then that would be another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3939)|
| 1:05:54| And if we opted to go through procurement, there's nothing at the end of that process that says once we get through there, if we decide ultimately we actually do prefer TSBA service, we could still go that route, even if we went through procurement, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3954)|
| 1:06:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| I mean, as Mr. Myers was saying, once you get to the end of that process, you should have a qualified candidate if the board wants to go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3971)|
| 1:06:20| But the board still has to give approval for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| And if the board decides, hey, we'd rather go a different route at that point, TSBA or otherwise, then the board can decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| So just to personally speak about this for just a moment, I do like, I do think we need to have a lot of community input regardless of the avenue we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=3994)|
| 1:06:48| And I know that KEF has generously offered to help facilitate that and we have worked with them in the past and, you know, they work closely in our community and in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4008)|
| 1:07:00| So, you know, if we do decide to use TSBA or whatever route we choose, I would really support using that organization to help gather community feedback as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4020)|
| 1:07:14| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Could we discuss, in addition to this decision, also we need to decide, I'm assuming that this board needs to go ahead and decide pretty soon, over the next month or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4038)|
| 1:07:31| to get together and talk through what we are looking for as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| Is that everybody else's assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| I don't think we talked about that a lot last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| Maybe I'm confused, but it sounded, and obviously it depends on where, how we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| but it did sound like when she was talking about TSBA that that is part of their process is talking to us and leading a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| Am I wrong about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Okay, so if we went with TSBA, they would lead that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| That was my understanding from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| That's part of, like, they do the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I think that would be great if somebody else, I mean, that's how we did it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| We had a third party lead it anyway, so I think that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Well, and one of the nuances that she said there in relationship to the board is that they would have individual conversations with board members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| That's what I heard, so I wasn't sure if I missed the whole board thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| Gotcha. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| I think whatever we do, I really do like as much community involvement as possible, and I would even like to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| when we talk about the process, maybe even on the other side of it once we get candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| Having a way that we can get community involvement, maybe interviewing, you know, community leaders interviewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| and I mean, a lot of times I do look at some of our higher learning places, whether it's, you know, the technology center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4125)|
| 1:08:53| I mean, the tech center or Pellissippi or UT, some of those partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| because I do think that working relationship as well as business people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| maybe some roundtables on the other end of it, and we always talk about it on the up front side of, like, what are we looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| but then I think sometimes getting, I would love to see some of that input too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Once again, not taking the decision out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| I think it's ultimately our decision, but I think it would be interesting to see the questions even almost to listen in on, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4154)|
| 1:09:22| a community roundtable of community leaders kind of interviewing and vetting questions to, like, our top candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| to see what they're looking for and what their impression is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| and once again, I still at the very end of the day always think it needs to be our decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| and I did like Miss, I'm brain dead right now, I'm sorry, Miss Christy talking about the community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4176)|
| 1:09:47| whether it's just an addition to, once again, it depends on who we go with, but, like, if we went to CSBA, they do the one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| but maybe add on some additional feedback just to get as much and as many different groups in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4194)|
| 1:10:03| I just think that that would really interest me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| I just want to also just say I love the idea of bringing in KEF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| They work in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| They work in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| They're a great organization to get this organized for us, and I love the idea of the roundtables and bringing business leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| because that was something that was important to me to have that voice in there just because the superintendent works with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| higher learning institutions and works with these people daily, and they have a good insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| and so I love both of those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| So I would say my vote and my support would be to do a full-out RFP, and TSBA can still apply and go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4249)|
| 1:11:02| I just feel like this just might be a little cookie-cutter, and Knox County Schools is in a, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| we are a very unique district, and just having a cookie-cutter approach, that's what I got from the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| Now, I could be completely wrong, but having a cookie-cutter approach might not get us to the direction that we need to go as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| school system at this size and this capacity, so I would support an RFP that goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| and if TSBA is the one that goes forward, then great, but, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Now, Mr. Dupler, I don't think TSBA would, they would not be a part of that RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| They would be, they wouldn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Because they're already, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I mean, I'd have to get with Matt Myers on that, and he may be able to answer it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| It looks like he's coming up, but I don't know that answer to that question right off, but maybe he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| They could apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| I mean, I look at them as a vendor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| They want to submit and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| It's not a closed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| You know, I'm all about being open and transparent and everything else, so they could apply, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Is there an amount, like I know she was talking, they had a, what, a $6,500, and then is there like an amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| a minimum amount for putting out an RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| And I know, does TSBA fall under the professional services since we're already, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| I don't know how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Well, so, yes, TSBA, due to the amount, due to everything you just said, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| you all could go through TSBA already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| Matt Myers will tell you that up to $25,000, I mean, you don't necessarily have to have an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4371)|
| 1:13:00| You could have a different type of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| 25 to 50 is another threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| 25 to 50 and above, you have to have an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| So the amount does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| That's the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| Ms. Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| I think I have a question for Mr. Myers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| If TSBA does go through the RFP process and they are not the top candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| and then we decide that we prefer TSBA, is that a possibility, or are they out of that contention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4408)|
| 1:13:37| Well, they would be out of the RFP process because, you know, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| we would shortlist, rank, final evaluations, and get your top-ranked proposer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| If they weren't that top-ranked proposer, then the RFP would just have to be canceled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| and you all do more of a professional services agreement with TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Ms. Bass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| You know, obviously we're going to have to vote on this next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| but if we went the RFP process, then I think we should encourage TSBA to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| so that we see at the end of the day how do they stack up, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| And, I mean, I think I don't know yet how I'm going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| I mean, I have to look at some of this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| But I think where Ms. Satterfield is coming from is we do want to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| and make sure that we're, at the end of the day, getting the best services possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| and do we not know that with just knowing what TSBA does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| Ms. Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Yes, Ms. Horne, since you serve on the board now of TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| I don't get the impression that TSBA will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| I mean, and maybe that's a question to ask Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| I don't get the impression that TSBA is going to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| to be a part of Knox County's RFP given the amount of superintendent searches they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| I mean, I know they're actively involved right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| and I just don't see with their experience and what they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| that that is something that they really are going to step out and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| But I could be wrong, and that's a question, I guess, for Ms. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| What are your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| I think that would definitely be a question that maybe we should ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| I mean, I don't know if individually or we could ask Ms. Coatney to ask on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| but I think that's a good question because I'm not sure if they would apply or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| And so two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| One, I am on the board of TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I'm an at-large member this year on the board of TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| I receive no compensation from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| And I think that Mr. Dupler and their attorney have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| if that's a conflict of interest or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| And correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| but I think it's been determined that it's not a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| It's not a direct conflict of interest because you have no financial interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| as you just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| And since you are noting a potential conflict publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| then you might want to talk about if you could be objective or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| So if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| So I feel like I've certainly learned a lot about TSBA over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4579)|
| 1:16:27| I think the last time we went through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| I was not in favor of TSBA doing the search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| So I certainly feel more comfortable with them at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| So I feel like I could be objective for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Did I answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Just a comment in reference to what you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| particularly in reference to what Ms. Bounds had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| I think TSBA would sort of look at it like we're here, we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| If you want us to help you, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| But we're not going to go out and beg you for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| If you want to go do somebody else, we'll enjoy seeing you at the state meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4634)|
| 1:17:25| I do think, can I follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Sorry, I didn't wait for you to recognize me, Ms. Christie, and I know how that feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| But I would like for Ms. Coatney to maybe ask Ms. Grissom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| because what I hear is a lot of people want RFPs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| but they want TSBA to come in there and say, okay, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| We're one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| And I just think we need, before we take a vote next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| to know if that's going to happen or not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| And I kind of agree with my two colleagues here that I don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| So I don't think that, if you'll clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I don't even think that's a discussion going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Those of you that support the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| what is it about the process that you feel like you can't live without in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4700)|
| 1:18:30| Yeah, I think for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4710)|
| 1:18:39| Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| I think for me it's just more of just comparing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| I haven't went through this process with superintendent search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| and I don't know what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| And, again, it feels very cookie cutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| and now the other outside organization could do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| and then that would clear my curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| But for me, I just want to see what else is out there outside of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| School Board Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| Are you done, Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| I agree, too, that I don't think TSBA is going to want to jump into an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| And that's why I asked Mr. Dupler the question, if we got through the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| even if they weren't a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| could we then still opt to go with them if we just felt like at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| day they were the better one, which we could do, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| So regardless of whether or not they jump into the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| I don't think we're tying our hands by going through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| I agree with Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| I think this is the most important decision that at least I'll be a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| in four years on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| And so because of that, I really appreciate Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| She took a lot of time to answer my questions in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| I appreciate the organization, but I'm comparing it to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| I don't have anything to compare it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| And so I think having the opportunity as a board to be able to look at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| others could do through a search is an important part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| And I also think that I might feel very differently if we only had five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| or four months or something like that, but I think having nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| we have enough time to do that process in that way and then go through an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| I know from reading TSBA's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| they said their average search is three to five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| So if you throw an RFP on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| I think we have ample time to go through that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| So I'm not feeling as pressured about the time maybe as some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Matt, I have another question for you if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| So my question is in the RFP process, so when you're putting this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| are these firms that are like do you specify that you want a firm that it's their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| to search for superintendents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| That's what we did with the one that closed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| And, you know, obviously when we're looking for medical directors in our present day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| I think that's why we only got two responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| A lot of people want to touch that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| But, yeah, I think you have to at least let them know what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| You know, we're looking for a superintendent and give all the demographics of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| You know, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Everything that we can give them enough information to respond the way we would like for them to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| So you would expect to get respondents back who feel like they are capable of doing that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| As far as specifically to the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Just one additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| And this should not be taken to indicate that I'm in favor or opposed to either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4923)|
| 1:22:13| But I was just sitting here thinking about Tammy Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| We all know who she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| We see her when we go to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| And I don't think probably because of longevity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4946)|
| 1:22:34| I don't think there's anybody sitting around this table that's argued with her more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| I think she would confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| But having said that, I do think that she will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| It's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| The third largest system in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| I, or we, as her organization is, are determined we're going to do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4977)|
| 1:23:06| and cover all the bases for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| I just, I mean, for what it's worth, I just felt like I needed to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=4990)|
| 1:23:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| I have a question for Matt again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I'm sorry, I have to come back up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Can you tell me, and are you allowed to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| how much did the RFP for the medical, the medical one that you have referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| how much does that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| How much did that cost you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| The RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| The RFP process getting to today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| I mean, several staff hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| I mean, you know, Ms. Whitehead worked on it, you know, a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| We got a scope of work from Mr. Van DeBate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| We actually got the job descriptions that were held in HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| and made those attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| So, you know, put a dollar figure to it, it would be hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| But a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| Mr. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Two more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| So you mentioned scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| So that's one of the things that the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| if we went through an RFP process would help form and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| here's the things that we're looking for in a search firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| These are the aptitudes we would want you to have, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Well, yeah, that scope of work is for the firm that would come and do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| To do the work, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| And that scope of work would be, you know, different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| It would be determined after we have the company under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| And if we went through procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| it would not preclude Knox County schools from having an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| source of funding to pay for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| We would not have to pay out of our, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| general operating budget or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| There could be, if there was a third party entity who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| we would fund that through a grant for you to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| We could do that if we went through procurement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| I mean, I would be using general operating dollars or however they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| Well, no, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| when we actually pay for the search firm for their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| are we able to use funds outside of our general operating funds to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| I would have to defer to Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| Thanks, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| I really need to vet that a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Here's, I don't see why we couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| Let me say it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| And I may have to defer to Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| So, Mr. Watson, to make sure I understand your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| you're saying that the funding for the search firm ultimately would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| not from taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| I just want to make sure that by using the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| it didn't tie our hands from using non-taxpayer funds to pay the search firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| If there was an entity that was willing to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| I don't see that it would, but I'll defer to Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| Anybody can make a donation to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| Once that donation is made to Knox County Schools, unless it's restricted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| Knox County Schools can use it for whatever purpose it intends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Because I think that is a question on the mind of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| is no matter how much this may or may not cost, is that valuable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| And I think it's important to know what the options are in terms of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| One of them is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| So, when we talk about developing the scope of work that would go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| would you all help lead us in trying to figure that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| or is that kind of up to us to figure out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| I mean, kind of walk me through that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| We'll be glad to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| But I really don't want to let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| I mean, we'll do what we can to help, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| I'll share with you what we did for the one that just closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| if you give somebody, you know, kind of a groundwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| We'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| And then my next question is not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| And this is where I had to scoot out of our workshop a little bit early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| and I don't know if this is the place to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| but did we talk about how we're doing the three-person committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| or if we're doing the three-person committee, did we even get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Well, we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| There were various opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| So I don't think we landed on anything specifically other than I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5252)|
| 1:27:41| everyone was okay with having a three-person committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| but how that committee would be chosen, there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| It may be I'm wrong, but if we go the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| it doesn't sound like the three-person committee would be needed until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| after their candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| I mean, what do you all think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| I mean, well, that's what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| If we're having a three-person committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| do we need them on the forefront of this process, or is it coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| I mean, I'm sure this is, I guess, where we have to decide this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Or is it coming in once we kind of more have the vetting of candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| from the search firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| And once again, I hate that I have to leave a little bit early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| Well, and it might depend on what we land on too and the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| which process we land on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Well, I was just thinking about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| because I kind of have the same question about the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| like what would the role of the committee be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| So we talked about it a little bit, and I think you had already left maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| but we talked about that it would be kind of a liaison between the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| and it would probably, I'm thinking that it probably would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| into the process on timing and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| basically just relaying to the search firm what the board's intentions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| you know, are to make sure we're having the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| the public meetings that we want, to make sure we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| the community members are being invited, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| So it would really be, it wouldn't be decision-making in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| It would just be simply to make sure we are moving along the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Yeah, and now that I'm thinking about it, if I don't understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| is I do think it would be good for this committee to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| once a search committee is working, they are the liaisons with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| So I do wonder, do we need it before the search firm is determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| You know, it might be, if we go with the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| maybe we need a three-person committee right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| or it might be by the time a search committee is selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Probably depends on, if it's an RFP, it's not as big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| If it's CSBA, then we would need it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| Ms. Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Could the board's search committee be your RFP committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| But could they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| You know, if you want the same committee who evaluates it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| to work with the search firm in that statement of work that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| you know, what you're actually looking for, you know, community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| you know, so many candidates we'd like to see or interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| things like that, it can be the same or it can be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| So moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| So I'm hearing that we want both the option, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| to vote next week on whether we want TSBA or an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Am I hearing that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| And also we need to decide how we're going to form this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| or the process, because if we do go with TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| it sounds like we're going to need a committee pretty quickly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| So, you know, I would like to hear a little bit of board input on how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| would want to proceed with that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| or how we're going to choose that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| Would it be helpful for us to contact Ms. Coatney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| and have her compile some thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Mr. Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| Since it's the board's committee, would we not, as Ms. Owen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5506)|
| 1:31:55| contact Ms. Coatney and then put a list of everybody that wants to be on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| Everybody wants to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| You know, I don't know where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| But in the past, we have voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| And that's a customary procedure for you to start with a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| and you vote around the table once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| And the low person or persons, if there's a tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| you drop them and move on until you get down to your three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| I think, Mr. Dupler, could you speak to the sharing information with Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| Well, I mean, if board members wanted to just indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| whether or not they wanted to serve, that would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| I mean, you know, board members can't communicate directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| or indirectly in this case through Ms. Coatney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and, you know, share thoughts and ideas and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| But if you're just taking a poll as to who wants to serve and who doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| then that would be allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| You know, the board can proceed one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| The board can vote, just as Mr. McMillan proposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| or as board chair, Ms. Christie has the ability to appoint a three-member committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| and then the board would need to vote and ratify that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| My recommendation is to the chair create the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| and then we vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| You're going to be on it either way, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| And we're going to make sure you're on there, too, Mr. Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Let's see how many people want to be on there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Yeah, just let Ms. Coatney know if you want to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Yeah, just let Ms. Coatney know if you want to be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| So, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Does anybody else have any more thoughts on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| So, we can move on to the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| So, consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Under items and contracts, any concerns on or discussion on 1, 2, or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5671)|
| 1:34:46| 4, 5, or 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Item 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| And under board policies, concerns on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5695)|
| 1:35:03| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| G or H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| I or J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| K or L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| Or M or N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| And just to make a statement on policy, we did have a policy review meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| and the board did discuss these policies at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| so we're not just going through them really quick without having any discussion or review on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5745)|
| 1:35:53| And 8, grants, any discussion on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Mr. McPherson, can you share with the board if anything had changed in the budget for our ESSER grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| from the time we heard the presentation to this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| I'm not, I may have to yield to Dr. Roswick, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| Anything of substance, I just want the public to know that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| Not for ESSER 3, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| John, are you aware of anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| I think that, again, this application, it's going to mirror, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| it mirrored what had been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Of course, it's in the accounting jargon and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| but I'm not aware of anything that changed since the plans or recommendations were presented to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5799)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I would just add, I think in talking to Ms. Martin, I know she's here, she may want to speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| but I think the main thing was when we did the presentation, we wanted to present all the concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Where we thought there could be some changes would be, if we said 152 are tutors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| maybe it was only going to be 140 once we did the numbers, or it could be 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| So, I think in general, I think there may have been one swap maybe around something from ESSER 2 to ESSER 3 around technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| I don't know, but maybe Ms. Martin could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| I think that was the only, I think there was one place where we did, it was all still part...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Is it fair to say that the overall strategy and the objectives of this plan are the same from the presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Okay, Cheryl's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| The one thing is kind of the swap, but it didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| The only thing that's changed from the original concept, and it really didn't change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| is that we were able to add in some additional Chromebooks and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| Maybe this is Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| What is the process now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| So, at this point, if we vote on this next week, is this just going to the state at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| or what's the process in this, actually ever finding out if we get this money or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| We actually, the full grant has been submitted to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| So, some of these pieces are just pieces that we have to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| The first part of that is a planning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| There's two items for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| The first is the planning grant, the $150,000 that we were awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| and I think maybe Mr. Watson had referenced earlier that KEF had helped us with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| So, this is reimbursement for them fronting money on some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| And then the second part of that is just the, you know, we talked in concept and the overall amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| This is just kind of the full budget, like the spending plan laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| So, this just goes to the state as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| They're still in that 30-day review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| As of now, we haven't gotten feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| I mean, I think the process has taken them probably a little longer than we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| but we do expect with a grant that size that we'll probably have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| some areas they're going to ask further questions on and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| But to date, and talking to Ms. Martin yesterday, we don't have feedback on those questions yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| And then once the state approves it and we work everything out with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| does then the federal government have to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| or is it approved at the state level to be funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| My understanding, and again, Cheryl, come correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| is that the state already has their criteria for approval through the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| Once they approve it, then it would be, the dollars would be released to the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| Okay, so we're kind of down to the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| So, under item C or D, E or F, and under non-contracts, item A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=5981)|
| 1:40:03| and 10 regular agenda items, and A or B, item C, just sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6003)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Just so that the folks who are watching, item A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| approve employee health insurance premium rates for 2022 to reflect employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| covering entire increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| So, I just wanted to kind of call attention to that because that will be good news to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| So, either of you want to speak on that or just you think that kind of covers it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| Basically, there wouldn't be an increase to health insurance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| Madam Chair, may I say one thing before Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| I have talked with Ms. Hancock and we've got a collaborative conferencing session tomorrow afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| but Ms. Hancock has already talked with some members of the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| and the members of the conferencing team accept this, appreciate this recommendation too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| and certainly would hope that the board would entertain approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| It's a small increase, but as Ms. Horne said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| it keeps the employee from having to pay any additional money for their share of the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| Right now, if you look at all of our policies overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| we're at about a 71.1% average on all the different policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| This doesn't help us a whole lot, but it gets us to 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| So, anything we can do to improve the benefits I think is really a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| Our employees, and they've shown it this year, they've shown it last year, they show it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| They work so hard and anytime we can give them a benefit, whether it's salary or insurance or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| I just appreciate this board giving that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| If you look at annual costs, on some policies it's only $21 over the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| but on the highest policy it would be about $396 on the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| But, again, every little bit helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| So, just before Ms. Thurston speaks, I just wanted to say a few words for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| who work so hard and deserve everything we can provide for them. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. I think that pretty much says it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| Thank you for bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| So, TNC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| D or E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Can somebody just speak to item D in terms of the career and technical education class average limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6164)|
| 1:42:50| and why that's being recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| Yes, Dr. Roslick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| So, the layout for that, what's required, there's a reduced amount of seats for a CTE classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| By the way, if you don't ask for a waiver from the state, there's a limit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| So, you can have a maximum of 25 students in a CTE class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| but the average for the day can't exceed 20, minus the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| So, all this allows us to do is to have a max of 25 kids in a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| and it lets us raise the average for that to set to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| It just allows us to have more students in a class up to 25, and the average being 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| And right now, we're having to seek this waiver annually, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| We've done it for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| And so, there was a revision made in the law three or four years ago that if you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| and it was really around, I think, Metro Nashville, where they went to an academy structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| So, there's some language in there that if you have academy structures or academy-like structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| you don't have to have the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| So, technically, like a freshman academy would count for that or, you know, CTE kinds of academies within a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| So, like Metro Nashville doesn't have to do that every time, but we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| I mean, any other district has to apply for that waiver to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| unless they have that kind of structure in a school or in a series of their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| Okay. With no more questions, we will turn it over to the Vice Chair for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| Before I go into my full duties as Vice Chair, I want to let the board know we have people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| that are wanting to speak on items that are not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| So, I want to see if anybody would be interested in entertaining a motion to suspend that part of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6286)|
| 1:44:58| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| So, before we go on to public forum, public forum speakers shall address remarks to the entire board and not individual members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6300)|
| 1:45:09| Each person speaking shall state his or her name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| and have up to five minutes to make remarks unless time is extended by the majority vote of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| Members of the board and the director of schools may have the privilege of asking questions to any person who addresses the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6318)|
| 1:45:25| The board respects and appreciates the good intentions that bring citizens to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| The board asks that speakers show their respect to the board, the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| and other citizens by speaking in a manner that is civil and courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| The chair or vice chair shall have the authority to terminate the remarks of any individual who is disruptive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| degrading, or insulting or does not adhere to public forum rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| Our first speaker is Mr. Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6349)|
| 1:45:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Ms. Helena Rago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6361)|
| 1:46:16| Is Helena here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6378)|
| 1:46:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| I didn't see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| My name is Helena Rago, and I'm a Knox County resident of the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| I do feel that it is very important that the community have an input on our new superintendent, whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| Next we have Kaitlyn Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6415)|
| 1:47:07| Just to confirm, we can talk about off items, off agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| That's for our next, at the next board meeting you will have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| And I request a second amendment for that due to the discrimination of children with disabilities that is happening in our county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6437)|
| 1:47:26| So prior to starting public forum, I asked the board if they wanted to suspend the rules, and there was not a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| So I then would like to touch on the policy that the board and the Knox County school system is receiving a grant for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| That's what you guys are voting on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| I don't think this board or anyone in this county deserves to get any extra money for special education when we're allowing children who are in special education to not, to be discriminated against and not allowed to go in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6464)|
| 1:48:01| And not only is that happening, but parents of children with disabilities like myself who aren't supposed to be in schools right now, I can't even speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6481)|
| 1:48:12| I'm being silenced in every way that I look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| And you guys are about to get more money for my son, and I can't even come up here and talk to you about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| I'm not allowed to come up here and say that, but you guys are getting money from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And he's not allowed in the school building due to a federal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| So I just think that no one deserves that money for my child if I'm not allowed to speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6510)|
| 1:48:40| And if he's not allowed to go into a school because of his disability, no one deserves that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Next we'll have Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| I didn't want to butcher it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| If you could say your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Parker Bartholomew, 816 Claybrook Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| I was going to talk about something that's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| I will say that by the time the next meeting's up, if the order is followed, I'll be brought up or could potentially be brought up on truancy charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6550)|
| 1:49:22| So I'm asking the board if I could talk now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| If not, then I'll have to withdraw my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| You have five approved absences or unexcused absences before a social worker is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Just for the sake of the decision that was made before public forum, we'll have to ask you to come next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Next we have Christina G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| Christina G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6596)|
| 1:50:05| It's Gehrman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| It's totally not obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| So my name's Christina Gehrman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| I'm in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| I have a kindergartner and a three-and-a-half-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| So I'm here to speak about the upcoming superintendent search, but I also wanted to thank the district for providing the student outcomes data that was presented earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6616)|
| 1:50:24| I found that to be super helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| And I just, the presenter remarked that the economically disadvantaged students in Knox County are our most educationally fragile students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| And that phrase really resonated with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| And I just wanted to ask the board to please prioritize those students and their educations and your plans to spend any federal relief funds that we are hopefully going to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6637)|
| 1:50:49| And specifically, please, I want to ask you to invest in teacher retention at our Title I schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| And please invest in that aggressively and generously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| I saw a teacher meet and greet this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| You know, my child is a kindergartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| And I saw the first graders coming back to hug their teacher who they hadn't been able to hug during that pandemic year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| And I saw how much it meant and how much that relationship meant to them coming back into that school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| And I know that that really makes a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| So, but regarding the superintendent search, I know that everybody in town either is now or just was really mad at you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| And I guess I just wanted to say that I think it's really important that you conduct this search in a way that is going to earn the trust of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6686)|
| 1:51:34| Because right now, we're all in a very vulnerable kind of ouchy position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| And I think that it's the students, but it's also the teachers and their families who are going to be impacted by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| And so, you really need to consider input from them if you want to kind of heal some of the divisions in the community in the process of choosing the next super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6704)|
| 1:51:53| So, to me, what that means, the way you do that, is it means transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| And it means community input at every single stage of the process, not just at the very end when you're vetting a list of kind of final candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6718)|
| 1:52:07| So, you know, we need to be able to weigh in on the process, not just the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| And I think actually that an RFP for an outside organization to run the search would allow the public to weigh in on the selection of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6731)|
| 1:52:19| And that that would be very strategic of the board to kind of take that step to let the public weigh in on that process and have that part of things be transparent right from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6739)|
| 1:52:27| So, when I was thinking about this, I was glad to see that Board Chair Christie went on the record in the Knoxville News Sentinel in support of transparency in the search process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6747)|
| 1:52:36| And I was also glad to see Board Member Watson on the record in the Sentinel calling for anti-bias training for search committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| But I wanted to note that one of the best ways and, in fact, an essential way to actually conduct an inclusive and unbiased search is to constitute a diverse search committee up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6762)|
| 1:52:52| So, the committee itself has to be representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| And the committee has to actively seek and seriously consider input from all of the parties whose interests stand to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| So, for example, the representative who spoke earlier from TSBA said TSBA doesn't pick those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| They just screen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| And what that means is that the inclusive committee representation and any anti-bias training would have to happen at their level within that organization if it was going to be impactful for our search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6790)|
| 1:53:20| So, if we don't have that inclusivity and that training until it gets down to you all, and if they've already screened the candidates, the damage is already going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| So, if you all are really committed to that, then you need to consider that as a kind of make or break feature of any search firm that you're going to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| I guess the last thing I want to say on that is just that, you know, I think that if the search firm that you hire, like, I understand the interest in using a third party, but you all are our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6814)|
| 1:53:48| Like, that search firm is not here listening to me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| You are here listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| And you are here making eye contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| And you are here kind of showing up for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| We elected you because you have expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| And so, I would encourage you to just consider using that expertise to do a good faith search that engages the community and that allows for maximum community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6839)|
| 1:54:08| So, final thought is just on the question of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| Teachers and principals and all school staff really ought to have a dedicated active role and a voice in the search process and in the eventual hire throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6853)|
| 1:54:22| They are the people who are inside the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| They are the people who are most impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| They are the people whose expertise could really, really influence the kind of make or breakness of this person being able to do their job when they get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| And they have to deal with our community, with all of our friction and all of our diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| And when they also have to deal with all of the specific challenges that students face in our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| And all of the wonderful talents that our students have, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| So, you know, I just think if you could take all of these things into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| But especially, you know, the fact that our next superintendent is going to work for us, for our community, for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6891)|
| 1:54:58| And will serve the educational interests of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| So, the community, I think, deserves a central voice in the decision about their hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Next, we have Eric Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6916)|
| 1:55:27| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| My name is Eric Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| I live in 37918 in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| I am a K-PASS parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| And I'm here to represent my children, my family, and the interest of our community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| I understand that next week you're looking to discuss the $114 million federal grant known as ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| That hopefully we will have the opportunity to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| My understanding is that this ESSER grant has specific earmarked purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| To support our children who have lost learning due to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| And to help further our mitigation efforts to prevent the continuous spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| And to bring this to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| I know that this has been a very difficult and trying couple of years for everybody in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| No more than for our teachers, our administrators, our families, and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| Who have all been so grossly affected by this tragedy and the difficult times that we have been facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| We all, above all else, want this to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| Despite there being so much division in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| We are all unified in wishing that we were past this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Unified in wanting what is best for our children, for our teachers, for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| It is critically important that we ensure that we receive the full $114 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| That is already paid by our taxpayers for the purpose it is intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| For our schools, for our learners, to begin to make healing where there has been so much trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7013)|
| 1:57:00| I recognize that the discussion about mask mandates has been polarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| We see that in this room here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| There is so much more that we can be doing above and beyond mask mandates that we have not been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| And that are not controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| In the Knox Tennessee Board of Education's plan for safe return to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| There are several things that they list that they want to see in our application for that ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| Including, but not limited to, universal masking, physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory etiquette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| Improved ventilation, contact tracing, diagnostic screening and testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| Encouraging our staff and students to receive vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| Efforts to provide those supports and appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| The reality is that these requirements have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| And this creates a very real danger that that $114 million that our schools are entitled to may not be distributed to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7077)|
| 1:58:08| This week a federal judge, last week, a federal judge ruled on this case saying that we are not doing what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7088)|
| 1:58:17| It is a federal judge of that magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Excuse me sir, if you could just stay in the realm of ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| We will be able to receive these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Yes, just stay in the realm of ESSER funding and not discuss matters that are not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| The choices that we have made to this point are undermining the likelihood of us receiving this ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| It's critical that we take the steps that we need to to ensure that we are demonstrating that we can and will follow the obligations of this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7119)|
| 1:58:48| That we can and will take steps that are not controversial, but that are effective in mitigating the effects of COVID-19, bringing healing to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7128)|
| 1:58:57| and ensuring that we receive the funding that we need to support our parents, our teachers, our students, and our community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7137)|
| 1:59:06| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Our last speaker is Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7150)|
| 1:59:41| Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| So I try to look at the agenda items online since you don't have any paper copies out, but I couldn't find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7192)|
| 2:00:00| There was an error with the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| But I know the topics are on nutrition and the Homebound Program, and I've been waiting to speak for months about those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7203)|
| 2:00:12| We have to do better by our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| We have to stop using our taxpayer funds to purchase processed food to feed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| They're better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| The choices that we make today are going to affect them for the rest of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| It's going to affect their children and their children's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| Anything that we consume into our bodies has effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| They have epigenetical effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| We are what we eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| Stop giving them all those carbohydrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| Give them more salads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| In fact, I surely do hope there's no folic acid in those biscuits and all the buns and bread that they might eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| because that's toxic to a large majority of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| People don't know it because they just listen to the recommendations from the CDC and the FDA, and they say it's safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| and the doctors listen to them, and they say it's safe, and then they recommend it to pregnant women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7261)|
| 2:01:07| and they say, Here, take this, and take extra, and we're going to give you a prenatal vitamin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| and take it before you're even pregnant so your child doesn't get neural tube defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| And this concerns me about the teachers especially, because many teachers are of childbearing age and may consume that food as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| and they don't tell you that if you have certain gene variants and polymorphisms that, you know, the doctors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7284)|
| 2:01:32| they say, You know, eat it or take it, and then they give you the free food and wick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| and they have all that folic acid in the bread and cereal and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| and it can cause miscarriages, and it can cause death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| If no one's there to help that woman when she's bleeding, what does she do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| But that they say it's safe has been in our food supply for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| We have to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| There has to be accountability at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| We have to make sure they're getting proper amounts of protein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| The definition of malnutrition is being protein deficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| and, for example, my child was denied the first week of school of having nuts for snack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| They said, Well, she can bring peanut butter to the cafeteria because we separate the kids with peanut allergies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| but we couldn't give her some almonds or walnuts or something already cracked open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| It's not like a ball game where she's, you know, having to tear the shells open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| and there's going to be dust flying from peanut shells everywhere because I know that's a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| and I'm concerned about those children's safety just as much as their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| I don't want harm to come to any child, but we have to have some kind of balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| There has to be a way to make reasonable accommodations without causing harm to children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| without causing irreparable harm to children because that's what's being done in our school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| We have to stop using processed salt because it has all the nutrients gone in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| It has aluminum in it as a byproduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| We have to be careful with the soy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| and thank you for changing the PB&J that you couldn't find the ingredients on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| It said, Go here, and you click this link and click that link,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| and you can't find what the kids are being fed in the schools, and then come to find out it's a deception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| They put PB&J and it's soy butter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| Well, there's people with soy allergies too, and then soy is in everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| so everyone's getting too much of it, and it's a xenoestrogen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| so then it causes all sorts of problems in the body with the hormones and everything else with the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| and the kids need to get more vitamin D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| They need to be out in the sun more, the sun to synthesize the vitamin D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| especially children with darker skin because the more melanin you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| the more sun you need to synthesize the proper amounts of vitamin D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| You have to stop relying on the medical system for the homebound system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| because students like myself were failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| Everyone else cheated off of me in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| I aced the test, even missing three days in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| and the teacher says, You can't miss a day of this class or you're never going to catch up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| and I didn't take my book home, and we get a pop quiz, and I make a better score than anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| But they say, Well, you have to have a medical condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| I've had conditions that went for decades without being diagnosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| I've been misdiagnosed and harmed by the medical industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| and you want to put your faith and trust in your policies on a broken system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| Don't do it. Don't do it with any of your policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| You have to trust the parents that they know what's best for their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| whether it's religion, medical, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| They need to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Breathing helps get those, everything where it needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| They have to, you know, we have to, there's things that are vital to get these nutrients out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| So before we move to board forum, can I ask Mr. Duport to speak a little bit about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7493)|
| 2:05:03| just because we had a public forum speaker here concerned because her child could not go to school this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| about the mask exemptions that we currently have and where we are in the process of expanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7509)|
| 2:05:19| to be more inclusive of our other students who also need to be in school without masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| As has been referenced, there is a federal court order from the Eastern District of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| that has placed a mask mandate on Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| I am limited in what I can say by the court because any attorneys who are involved in the litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7541)|
| 2:05:49| because it's an active litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| we can't make a bunch of public statements outside of what's done in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| What I can talk about briefly is that there have, what's already been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7558)|
| 2:06:05| So the judge has filed an order and the only two explicit mask exemptions in that order are autism and tracheotomies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7565)|
| 2:06:17| We also, this system has also interpreted that order as if some students have an IEP or 504 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7577)|
| 2:06:27| that explicitly excludes masks, then we have looked at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7587)|
| 2:06:34| You asked about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| Obviously our office is taking measures as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| There was a motion filed on Monday that's public record for relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| We filed another motion today for relief, again public record, so those things can be referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| But we're addressing it as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| So moving to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| We'll start with our student rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| So I guess kind of just, I had a few things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| First was, of course, we returned to school yesterday with this new federal order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| I just kind of wanted to talk a little bit about, I guess, what happened on the ground there at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| I had an opportunity to talk with some students on our student advisory council yesterday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| And kind of, I feel like what happened is kind of what we most expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| There weren't too many very large issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| Students, for the most part, complied with this order and are doing what they are being told to do by administrators and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7649)|
| 2:07:38| There are a lot of students who are not necessarily properly wearing their mask, but they do have that mask on on their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| It's just not covering their nose, but it is covering their mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| I did hear about instances of students who fought with administrations and administrators who were trying to implement this mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| There were some who were cussing them out and doing other not very great things for these administrators who are already very much overworked and very much tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7675)|
| 2:08:03| So, of course, I hope that does not continue as we go through this week and as we go on under this federal judge order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7683)|
| 2:08:10| But, yeah, overall, things have gone fairly smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| There has been, of course, the protests we've had at some of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| Thankfully, I want to thank these people who have participated in these protests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| They have been, for the most part, peaceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| There has not been any harassment, largely violence, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| So I'm very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| There has been some harassment from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| I've heard anecdotally of students, you know, protests going to students who are wearing their mask and like, you know, take them off or calling them various names or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7713)|
| 2:08:43| But there have also been, on the other side, people verbally harassing these protesters, saying various things or otherwise, verbally harassing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7723)|
| 2:08:52| But, yeah, so overall, things are not going terribly that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| Second thing, I'm not exactly sure who asked this, but who did I ask this to, but I know that within our ESSER 3.0 funding, we have money for tutors and throughout our school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7737)|
| 2:09:07| I've been hearing recently from students, parents, parents of students, about how their students are, you know, because of last year, are very much behind on their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7747)|
| 2:09:18| And you're kind of wondering, what does this timeline look like for implementing tutors in our school systems to get kids back to where they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| I don't know who might have an answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| Dr. Reisweg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Thank you, Mr. Jens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| So, as we were saying earlier, so the process is, the funding is the ESSER funding for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| And our plan for the high school level is to have dollars for tutors, current teachers, to be able to teach either before school, after school, or on their planned period, depending on how that works out in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7781)|
| 2:09:52| So, the timeline really is, within 30 days of submission, we were supposed to hear back from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| We're really near those 30 days at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| So, we're expecting to hear that back pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| But it sounds like what we're hearing is the state has kind of gotten backlogged, maybe, too, on some of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| So, we're not exactly sure if after the 30 days they'll kind of give us this, here are all the questions for your plan, now you've got 30 days to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7808)|
| 2:10:15| Or if they'll slowly, you know, kind of trickle things to us as they review the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| So, we're kind of waiting on that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| So, I'm not sure, again, sometimes the way those big grants work is they'll release dollars and you continue to modify certain things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| And sometimes they'll wait until those modifications happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| So, we haven't gotten any feedback yet on specific things that we need to modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| So, once that's done, our hope, you know, I think our hope was that we would have that, you know, soon, very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| I mean, as soon as we can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| So, the process probably will be more like second semester for a lot of that tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| It's a little easier in the high schools because you're probably hiring current teachers where the plan for the elementary and middle would be to hire full-time people who would come on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7847)|
| 2:10:55| We have a person who will be kind of heading up that tutoring process for us and monitoring that part for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| So, I would say a safe bet is probably that that would be more fully in swing in the second semester due to when the funding's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| I would just want to say thank you to our staff and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| And this is a heavy lift this week, and they've already been working really hard, and it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7884)|
| 2:11:32| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Thank you to the superintendent and his staff and Mr. Dupler for all of your hours and hours that you've spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7894)|
| 2:11:42| This is a difficult situation for many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| And so, thank you for your patience as the law department is working through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| And so, anyway, just wanted to acknowledge that it's difficult, and we hear you, and we absolutely see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| I think Ms. Horn covered all of everything that I'm feeling, but we do hear you and we see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| And, you know, just to the families and children, that we're working hard for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| Ms. Bowne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| And I would just like to add on top of what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| I'm hearing a lot from our bus drivers and bus contractors, and they have a really heavy lift right now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| I know a lot of our contractors, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Superintendent, are down drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210929?start=7949)|
