| 2:12:28| to put more people on patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| and I need you to go from here to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| he may think it's political, but what if the sheriff says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| I just need people on patrol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| This is a he said, he said situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| Additionally, if we involve the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| in every routine lateral transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| that have very little law enforcement experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| is this body then giving a tool to an appointed body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| to then interfere with a duly elected sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| And that's the part where it gets into this legal area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| Ultimately, we couldn't come up with any wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| that satisfied the ability for an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| to address a transfer without opening up the box that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| everybody that gets moved anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| is going to file a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| and then this thing that's supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| sort of the last stop becomes the everyday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| I don't want to go do the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| because I used to be a patrolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Did I explain that right, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| Because this is probably the last big in the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| thing we've been discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| Most of the things that are in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| that are grievable are objectively quantifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| You either have a job or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| You were forced to engage in political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| or you weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| You had three days of suspension or you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Transfers, and I'll have to say that I've spoken extensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| with Chief Mike Ruble of the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| who's served under three or four sheriffs now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| transfers happen all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| And the language that's in the rules and regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| says that if you get transferred for political reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| or for a reason that's not mission critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| then you have a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| The problem with that is that that's not a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| That's not a bright line distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| And so anytime the sheriff feels the need to transfer somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| because of staffing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| and right now they have terrible staffing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| if the person doesn't want to go from day shift to night shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| then all he has to do is claim that it's political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| or it's not mission critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| And now we have a hearing in front of the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| and now we have lawyers involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| and it is just not practical to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| And I think it contravenes the letter and spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| of the private act that began this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| and the letter and spirit of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| that the commission passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| At a certain point, the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| and I think he would tell you this if he were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| the sheriff has to have the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| to put people where they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| And if every time he makes that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| it opens up the potential of a merit council hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| it would make the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| it would be very difficult for him to have the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| to do the job that the people have elected him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| And so we believe that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| that can go up the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| You can talk to your supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| You can talk to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| But that's one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| that ought to be internal to the sheriff's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| The sheriff feels very strongly about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| and I think my feeling is he's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8138)|
| 2:15:46| Thank you, Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| I'm happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| Are there any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| The motion before us is to move this ordinance forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| That was by Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| second, I believe, by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| That was Commissioner Durrett, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Let the record reflect Commissioner Durrett was a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| One of the final questions, if we're looking over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| are the lines that are underlined that are not red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| is that something that you added to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| that we talked about before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| I'll let Commissioner Jay answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| I will announce the vote was that the item did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| The lines that are underlined and bolded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| are changes from the ordinance as it currently exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| There is an ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| and those are the changes to that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| that you are considering for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| If they are highlighted in red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| which if you don't have a color copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| that means that since the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| it has that language been tweaked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| since the first reading passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| One other thing I want to ask the Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| and I want to think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| is that you heard the Peter principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| you know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Very much so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| I've always thought that I was a shining example of it, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| So if the Sheriff's in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| I heard all this talk about moving up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| You have this one officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| for people who don't know what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| and haven't read the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| is you're promoted up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| You know, you're doing a great job at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| and you get promoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| and you're doing a great job at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| but the next time you're promoted up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| you can't do that job as efficient as someone else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| Does this take away the Sheriff's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| to address that Peter principle of side moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| or whatever else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| but can the Sheriff still activate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| The Sheriff can transfer a person between positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| If you're talking about the Sheriff demoting somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| and that demotion comes along with a loss of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| then that's the kind of thing that could be taken to the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| And, you know, that doesn't mean that he's going to get reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| The Sheriff may have a very good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| If somebody's in a position he's not performing competently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| then the Sheriff should and does have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| to remove that person from that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| If that removal, though, involves a loss of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| then that person can take that to the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| and the Merit Council would then determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| whether or not the Sheriff had proper motive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| for displacing that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| Just didn't want to get in where you promote a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| and all of a sudden find out that they can't do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| No, that goes beyond the level of civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| that this document represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| Commissioner Jay, one last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| I know we've already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| Just one more quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Everything before you, I just want to remind everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| these are reforms and proposals to change the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| I've always said from the beginning of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| this is a continuing living document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| and if we can make it better, let's make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| If we can make it where it has more protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| and a good balance, if there's language that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| down the road as we get into the execution of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| if two months from now or six months from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| or six years from now or whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| somebody comes up with better language than this is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| that says here's a good way that we can address both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| or a better way to rewrite this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| We can do this process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| It's not like this is the last shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| So, you know, I'm always open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| That's why we've had this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| for what's really been active for two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| but really been a two-and-a-half-year process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| and so happy to always entertain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| and let's continue to find a way to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| to make it better for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8386)|

| 2:20:57| that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| If you look at the red-line copy version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| revised 7-14-22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| the blue is the new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| It is section 6.50.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8469)|
| 2:21:21| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8481)|

| 2:21:25| Will we be updating this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| to refer to what the Planning Commission is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| We no longer refer to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| as the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| If that's in there, then yes, we'll fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| It's on 6.40, first line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| The Planning Commissioners are MPCs still, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| It's the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| Throughout our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| or the Metropolitan Code Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| has not updated the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| I think we've provided for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| When they update the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| they will be changing all the references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| from MPC to Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| It just hasn't been done in the books yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8526)|

| 2:22:13| The motion is to move this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| to next week's regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Let the record reflect that Mr. Schoonmaker is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| That item passes to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| Is there any further business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8550)|
| 2:22:31| to come before this work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| September 1st is our reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| Can we set a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| Usually, square meeting is about 9, 9.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| That will probably take all morning long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| I believe we've set that at 1 p.m., have we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| 1.30, yes, 1.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| because this room is actually reserved at 3, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| 1.30 p.m. on September 1st in the main assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| No excuses, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| September 20th, market calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| is the PCCA dinner at the History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| History Center, 6 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| And finally, can we get new microphones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| That's a great suggestion, and you're not the first to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| So, yes, I will look into that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| I echo we need new microphones and an upgrade in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| Just a reminder, if you all would mark your calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| details will come out very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| August 18th and 19th will be new commissioner orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| So whoever is elected on August 4th will spend two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=8630)|
