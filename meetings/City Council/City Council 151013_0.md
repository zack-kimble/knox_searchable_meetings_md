| 0:03:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=207)|

| 0:03:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| And just as a reminder, I mean, it would take a unanimous vote to add it from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Oh right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=223)|

| 0:05:02| This was something that, you know, I went last week to Albuquerque, expenses paid by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Kauffman Foundation, along with about a dozen other mayors throughout the country, and Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Kauffman invited us all out there to talk about entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| This was the Mayor's Conference on Entrepreneurship, the second year I've gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| And part of it was they had this challenge and mayors were invited to submit their proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| for the use of $25,000 to help entrepreneurs in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| I think a dozen or so submitted and five were selected as finalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| And so each of us had to stand up and actually do a pitch, just like our entrepreneurs do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| a pitch at a startup day for the KEC and our other sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| And so thank you to Jonathan Sexton and Jim Biggs at Knoxville Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| They developed the concept based on their meetings with the entrepreneur support organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| and the entrepreneurs whom they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| And they put together the pitch for me, the slideshow, and all I had to do was deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| But in the end, we were one of the winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| We're actually tied with Louisville, and so they decided to give out two prizes instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| of just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| So Louisville brought home the bacon as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| They got $25,000 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| So we're real excited to bring that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Kauffman is a wonderful resource for people around this country, and the fact that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| focusing on cities like Knoxville and Albuquerque and a lot of others across the country, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| a dozen or so of them, it says something for us, I think, that we have their attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| since they're really known as global leaders in terms of entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| So that money will be coming to us, and we've got to raise some money to match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| And what actually they've proposed is an app that will be used for entrepreneur support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=408)|
| 0:06:56| organizations and entrepreneurs to match, similar to how we use our homeless management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| information system, which, as I made that point, they kind of laughed about it and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| entrepreneurs and individuals who are homeless, there's a lot in common there, because a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| of times there's a lot of similar issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| But the fact that HMIS is so successful working on trying to provide services, we're hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| that similar system will work for entrepreneurs and the support organizations that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| So anyway, so that's going to be coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| Also want to congratulate CAT for the shuttles to and from the UT football games that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| setting new ridership records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| You may have seen that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| More than 10,000 passenger trips typically for the season's games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| The trend is upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| We're carrying about 4,200 additional passengers, more than they were two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| We love that people are coming down, parking in our garages downtown or at the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| perhaps hopefully going to the restaurants and the other places downtown and then catching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| the shuttle over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| So that works out both for our downtown merchants and for keeping traffic at a minimum at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| So if you want more information on CAT's football shuttles, visit the CAT website at www.catbus.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| Okay, and it may seem hard to believe, but early voting is starting again, starting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=506)|
| 0:08:34| It seems like that just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Remember, so the mayor's race is over, but all four city council seats are on the November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| 3rd ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Whether there's an opponent or not, they're all on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| So we encourage everybody to get out there and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| The early voting runs from tomorrow, October 14th, to the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And then election day is November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| To get the polling hours and the locations, you can go to www.knoxcounty.org slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=539)|
| 0:09:10| Now there's some upcoming events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| I want to make sure it's on everybody's calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Tomorrow at 1130, the fire department will be honoring fallen firefighters with the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| department's annual memorial service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| And the gathering, which is at the Firefighter Memorial Park, which is there at Summit Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Drive at our headquarters downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| We'll honor the 24 firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| of Knoxville since 1904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| And we'll also honor the memory of the 10 retired firefighters who have passed since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| last year's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| And as you mentioned in your prayer, Councilman Wallace, the events, losing the two firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| just brings us home even more at the risk our firefighters take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| So we want to honor those who have lost their lives and those who have retired tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| So that's tomorrow at 1130 at the main fire hall downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Also at 230 this Friday, I'll be at the AmeriCorps opening day ceremony at the Knoxville Botanical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Garden and Arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| That is sponsored by the Community Action Committee, by CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| This is the opening ceremony for the AmeriCorps folks that come each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| We celebrate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Usually, you've probably met a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| This year, we actually have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| And I think there are something like 20, I believe 20, is that right, Eric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| 20 AmeriCorps this year or so that are in different nonprofits and organizations throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| But we have five, and they're working in our Office of Neighborhoods, Solid Waste Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Parks and Recreation, and the Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| So that's at 230 on Friday at the Arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| And then for the following week, at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, October 20th, we'll cut a ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| and open a new playground at the Dr. E.V. Davidson Community Center on Wilson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| And this is going to be a wonderful new amenity for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| That's Tuesday, October 20th at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| The ribbon cutting is set for Thursday, I'm sorry, October 22nd at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| And we'll officially dedicate the new $3.7 million drainage system along Cross Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| This is something that's desperately needed and has been needed, and we've finished it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| And you might remember this is the second major flood control project that the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| department has tackled this year, and we work on all kinds of drainage projects, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| is a major one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Remember, we cut the ribbon on Prosser Road earlier this year in January, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| And it's been dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| It's been dry, yeah, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Okay, finally, a new sort of fun is coming to the Center City on Sunday afternoon, October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| That's our open streets in Knoxville from 1 to 4 p.m. on October 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| Central Street will be closed to motorized vehicles from Willow Street in the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| to Oklahoma Avenue and Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| People of all ages and abilities will be walking, skipping, who's going to be skipping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| Let's hear if someone's going to be skipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| Dancing, bicycling, I'll be dancing, I'm going to try that, bicycling, eating, socializing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| and shopping their way along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| And the open streets concept is happening in dozens of cities around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| This is the Ciclovia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| It started in Bogota, Columbia, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| And Nashville had its open streets last summer, and Atlanta did an open streets last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| So we'll be, we're doing ours later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| So it's activities for kids, artists, and fitness demonstrations, and plenty of food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| So to get more information, go to OpenStreetsKnoxville.com, OpenStreetsKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| And we hope everyone, particularly all of Council, will be out there with us on October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Skipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Okay, that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Yeah, thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| I just wanted to report on a great event that took place over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| We had 150 high school, middle school and high school competitors here from all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| the state at the wood property, the 100 acres that was donated back a year or so, two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| ago, I guess it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| But they were here strong, all the way from Memphis to Mountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| And the unfortunate part is Knoxville didn't have a team in it, but I want to work on South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Doyle Middle and South, you know, South Doyle High School for, so we can compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| But it was great to see the kids out there, and the kids brought their parents, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| brought their siblings, and a lot of money was spent in Knoxville over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| And it was a great time to see these kids really participate and compete as they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| So it was a good, real good event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=851)|

| 0:14:49| It's not required that they come, but sometimes people come, and I want to recognize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=889)|

| 0:16:09| Maybe it's not a huge amount of money, but working with the Health Department, it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| like they're trying to figure out how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=970)|

| 0:16:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| So, it's an interesting program, and they have a grant award of $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Maybe it's not a huge amount of money, but working with the Health Department, it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| like they're trying to help employees, what, be more fit, avoid more health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| I didn't know if someone could give us a nickel's worth of that, but it's a nice initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| I mean, prevention instead of, what, emergency fixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=999)|

| 0:16:48| What we are trying to do is, again, it's a fairly small grant, but what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| to do is to encourage our employees to live more healthy lifestyles and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| And we're particularly focusing on diabetes because that has a high expense and also in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| both cost and in human suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| So again, there are a couple of things that we're looking at too in programs, we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| haven't decided between those two, but again, focusing on having our employees live more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1038)|
| 0:17:27| healthy lifestyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| I just think it's good to attack the problems on the front end rather than try to patch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| a blowout when it happens kind of thing, so I commend them for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1055)|

| 0:21:46| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| As you know, this came before us some time ago but at that time it had not been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| with the community and a couple of community organizations, the police department has visited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| with them and it has met with their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| I have gone down and met with the police as well and given the tenor of the times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| there has been attacks upon police officers individually as well as public buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| It would not bother the front part of the building but as I understand it, it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| around the back part of the building so I'm in favor of it and I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| I just want to add based on those meetings with you and with the neighbors, the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| of the project has actually been reduced to fence only what we really need to and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| also the design has been improved to be more attractive and actually kind of matches some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| of the other adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| So we appreciate that feedback from the community and from you, Mayor Brown, because it's made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| a difference I think in the quality of the project and I think it will be a good addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| I mean it's something that's necessary like you said due to the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| Councilman Steyer, I'm sorry with names tonight, I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| There's a lot of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Your name's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Your name's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I just have to look at your sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Well, I guess, you know, I have a lot of heartburn about this item and I guess my first question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| is in terms of the need, what exactly, you know, what are the numbers, what are the statistics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| I mean what's going on that requires this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I don't know if the Chief wants to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Councilman Steyer, I can tell you that first of all what we're doing is just restricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| the restricted area of the police department that's never been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| It involves the areas that are the employee entrances and where we keep cars and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| non-vehicle type equipment down in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| I can tell you looking around the country, you know, a quick search of the internet will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| show that in the last 18 months there's been 14 incidents in the U.S. where police departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| have been attacked by folks coming on the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| Again, this does not affect the access for the public coming in, does not affect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1455)|
| 0:24:24| area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| The front parking lot will be open, the front entrance is just like they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| The only thing that it does restrict is the employee only and the restricted areas around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Well, I guess then the question would be does it actually accomplish what it set out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| do if the public can just go in the front and attack the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Well, again, we have put measures in place recently at the police department such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| the metal detectors and we actually have people that are stationed right at the front door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| now to talk to folks and check folks as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| But what this does are those areas again where they are restricted areas of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| and it will keep people from just wandering up and actually I believe that it will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| the public and that we often have people who park and come up to the employee entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| and don't understand why they can't get in the employee entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| But in our facility has been there for decades and there's certainly been a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| of tension between the public and the police in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| Do we have any numbers on incidents there on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| I can tell you that I do not have any specific numbers over the years of incidents, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| can tell you in the recent history, the last year and a half or so, we have had someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| who had made threats to law enforcement show up at the employee entrance as a group was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| coming out and confronted folks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| We have in the recent past had someone try to steal a police car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| So we have had incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Again I couldn't give you a specific number of incidents we've had over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Well you know I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| It's just tough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| It's $238,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| You know it's really sort of the gateway to East Knoxville there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| There's a new housing development and they did put up a fence, but it's not gated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| There's other parking lots in the area that aren't fenced and gated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| I don't feel as a city, I don't want to send that message in that area that those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| should feel like they need to fence and gate their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| You know I think we have insurance on our property and to me $238,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| So you know I'm just, in just a sense of you know walls and fences it's just not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1619)|
| 0:27:09| I didn't like it when West High School put a fence around their property either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| They made it a little more decorative, but it's just not what I'm about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| It's just not what I think, the direction I think the city should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I was curious, I had asked today whether or not, I haven't seen any drawings of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| the fence looks like or even actually where the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Do you have those documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Yes sir, I do have those with me and I apologize, I thought that Chief Gass, I'm pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| she sent out an electronic copy of those earlier today, but I do have those here with me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| I have a little bit of heartburn over the fact also in terms of things that Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| Stair had to say in driving around that area and going up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| The concern I have also is just the idea that it has been open and you know almost a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Is there another way in which to you know protect the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I think that's highly important, but is there another way in order to do that besides having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| to build a wall or build a fence you know around those facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So that's a concern that I have also on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| I would say I push back on a lot of these same issues when Chief Roush brought this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| to me originally and he wasn't able to be here tonight to talk in more detail about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| this, but I have to say that they convinced him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| There's also the courts, we haven't talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| You know I've heard people say why do they all wear guns, why do they need to have security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| gates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Well not everybody that works there has a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| We have a lot of civilian employees and we also have the courts that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| And so based on the information that they brought, and this is a different day you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| in terms of some of the security issues we've seen around the country the realities of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| Again they've scaled back you know what sort of the minimum requirements they feel they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| It's a more attractive fencing which we have, if you look around there's fencing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| all kinds of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| You know if you do it in an attractive way then it doesn't have to be a detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| We don't see this as sending a message to the community, it's acknowledging the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| of securing certain public facilities today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| And I think the courts are a big part of that, that's a piece that's you know in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| So we waited, we pushed back exactly like you, I've raised those questions and I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| down on the side, Christy worked with them extensively on the issue and on the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| and on you know what was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| And we have come down that we do believe this is needed the way it's presented and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| ask for council to please support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I do have a question along those lines and I appreciate what you're saying Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| What are the plans as far as the new safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| How does that look in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Are we talking five years, ten years, two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Yeah, so Christy here, so a couple of things we did look at when we looked at the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| is to figure out which pieces and parts, if we moved this fence, if it needed to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| with us somewhere, which pieces and parts would be able to go with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| We have several driveways into that area and they will have secure arms and gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| All of those devices and pieces can be moved to another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Obviously moving some of that fence out will be tough, but a good majority of it, the expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| component pieces of that will be able to be moved to another site should we determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| that that needs to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Yeah, we'll be able to reuse a significant portion of it and the more expensive pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| will definitely be able to move to another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I appreciate what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Do we have a picture of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| It's got a sketch of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| We got it on email this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| We got it on email this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Yeah, I'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Okay, these are the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I don't have a specific picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| I'll give him a second to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| While he's looking, I did want to say that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Yes, I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1857)|

| 0:31:23| I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Yes, Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| I don't want to interrupt Councilman Del Po, but in terms of fencing, right across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| street there's a new apartment development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| They have fencing as well, which is going to be, if you see the picture, similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| what is planned for the perimeter of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I looked at the drawing we got this afternoon and the changes, meeting with the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| brings a different plan than we looked at some months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| And so I will be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I am very concerned that our folks who are charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| with keeping us all safe are also safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| as they're coming to and from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| And as you pointed out, the courts are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| and not everyone carries in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Councilman Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| I think, yeah, before it was gonna be a chain link fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| with barbed wire on top of it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I mean, it was dead ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| And I think that was the reason why we postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| And I appreciate Mayor Brown involving the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| and coming up with a better design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I mean, it looks very residential with the brick columns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| and, you know, in a rod iron looking fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| So I'll definitely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Well, I don't wanna delay this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| It certainly looks, I see how things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And I certainly applaud all the efforts to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| But I guess one concern I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| I mean, the fence is not gonna surround the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| So you're, I mean, if you wanted to drive up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and attack the building or someone in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| you still could, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I don't see how it, in terms of the courts are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| but the people that enter the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| are gonna enter the exact same way they do now, am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Right, but you wouldn't be able to get up as close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| as you can, especially on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| and the north area of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| But when people go to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| they don't come from that side, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Right, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So for people going to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| does it change anything at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Well, really what we're doing is simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| what we've been telling people in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| to do for a long time, and that's crime prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| through environmental design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| And we're never gonna be able to keep everything out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| but we should at least make an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| to keep out what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Right, right, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| But I mean, in terms of people going to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| there will be nothing different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| for people going to the court today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| as in after this project's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Well, what I said wasn't about people walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I mean, there are people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| And so if somebody comes up from the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| from the side that is not the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| where there's the security there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| you know, there are threats to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| And so if somebody's there, the judges, the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| the people that are there to pay their fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| or to go to court, they're all then put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| in a more risky situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| If you don't have proper security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| this is about getting proper security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| for the realities of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2059)|
| 0:34:19| And we're trying to do it as minimal as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and still provide the safety that we think is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Okay, I just wanted to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| that I wasn't missing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| because I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| No, they're gonna walk in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| they're gonna go through security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| You know, like anybody that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| You go to the courts, you come to KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| you come in and you go through security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I just wanted to make sure, because I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| I mean, because it says the perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| you know, in the agenda summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| which gives the impression that's completely around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| but that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| He's locking the back door, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Okay, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Yes, I just want to comment again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I was at the Danridge Avenue neighborhood meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| when Nate Allen and Chief Gass came and spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| And at that meeting, there was no feeling opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| And you had several people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| who were present, it's not a large number of people present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| but they were not opposed prior to, they were opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| because I think the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| was to put a fence around the entire building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| But now it will not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And as the mayor just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| when you go in that building now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| you gotta go through security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| So that will help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| And I certainly would not be supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| if I felt personally that it would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| that would be detrimental to the East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Now there may be some other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| will have some pushback against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| One person who met with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| was the Reverend Harold Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| And Reverend Middlebrook is supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So I feel pretty confident that long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| it's gonna be something that will protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| not only our officers, but the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| who work in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Because we gotta realize that today in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| you have security concerns from the left and the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So we need to protect our government buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I was in Salt Lake City earlier this year for a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| and went to the police building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| which is relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| And they have instituted security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| in terms of their windows and around the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| because that building had been attacked some years prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| So I think we have to consider all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| when we're considering what we're putting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| around our government buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Of course, this building and where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| as you say, it's sort of the gateway to East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Some people would just consider it part of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| but I'm confident that long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| this is gonna be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Of course, years from now, that building is outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| we're gonna have to think about a whole new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| but we won't get into that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2231)|

| 0:37:17| I appreciate the discussion that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| and I do understand, and I am concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| about the safety of our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| The one thing I do appreciate is we started out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| with a chain-link fence with, I guess, bob wire on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And aesthetically, the fence that's going in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| is gonna be an improvement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2250)|

| 0:38:24| about a press pit and a pit paddle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2304)|

| 0:40:32| Yeah, I see we have Gerald Green here from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Maybe you could tell us the essential difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| with the C2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Is this to adjust the parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| and things that are required in the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| as opposed to elsewhere in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Yes, sir, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| The C3 District is basically a suburban template| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| with significant setbacks and significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| The C2 is our intense downtown district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| which provides for no required parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| and allows lesser setbacks and would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| the redevelopment of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| consistent with city plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| So I guess the presumption is if you're downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| there's probably other public parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| that you can use to patronize some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| and realize that land is scarcer, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2484)|

| 0:41:56| We have two people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| The first is Xavier Presley and next is Vivian Scheidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2519)|

| 0:42:04| and address for the record and I'll set the timer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| and you have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Yeah, my name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| On September 21st, a black helicopter circled my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| three times so low that I could see the three guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| in the helicopter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| I went in the front yard and waved at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| and they flew away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I told you people before when KUB had an FBI agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| following me to the county commissioner's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| and came to my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| You people just don't wanna help get KUB to come clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Every time I call the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| they say we have no control over KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Somebody has to start looking at what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| There's no excuse for our electric bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| to keep going up and up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| My bill jumped from 420 in August to 450 in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| and I'm expecting it tomorrow when it comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| to be more than that and I'm gonna be at their board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and try to embarrass them to tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I don't appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I'm just standing up for us people that can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| to keep just giving KUB money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Last year, they raised our bill $8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| November 1st, they're gonna raise our bill two more dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| Next year, they're already scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| to raise our bill two more dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| And TVA is just as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| I wrote the Department of Energy in Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| and they referred my letters and phone calls back to TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| Ain't no excuse for it, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Eventually, we'll see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| I wanna make sure I get better in middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| We received 1,200 iPads for every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| in the school last week by Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| I wanna thank Dr. McIntyre for keeping up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| and the principal and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| It went off like it was supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| No headaches, no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| The kids was happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Parents are happy and the school need to be amend for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| They need to be complimented for that real good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| because that could have been chaos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| like it was at Bearden High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| when they got their Apple computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I called the mayor's office last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Last month, I called the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| complaining about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Only to have KUB, we have no control over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| I called the mayor's office last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I called the mayor's office last Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| And I called Sunday to this guy, Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| complaining about speeding tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| on Middlebrook Pike and Broom Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| My sign is, they say Brenda Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| is telling them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| That's what the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| and the police department told me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I'm sure we did not tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Well, follow it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Trace the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| They told me Brenda Palmer told them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| And the intersection is a stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| You can make a left turn to go toward Fellowship Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| or you can make a right turn to come down west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| going toward the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| And the police, he's blocking the right-hand turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| Now, if you want us to obey the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| how can we obey the law when you got the lane blocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| because he wanna sit there and get tickets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| And then finally, when the traffic was able for me to turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| I got in the left lane and I passed him at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Now, I got to look to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| to make sure I don't have an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| because he's blocking traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Then I finally turn in front of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| and this guy give me a dirty look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| like he ready to put me in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| We shouldn't have to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I understand you wanna make money giving tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| but don't go to that extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And then the same thing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| the lady told me on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| either the police department or the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| that the citizens and the homeowners are complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| That's the biggest joke in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| because there's no houses from Walker Spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| all the way to Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| There's no houses on Middlebrook Pike in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| And I noticed this time of month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| that's when they're out giving tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| So it's easy to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Make money, but don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| And you wanna make money on a Sunday at 2.15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I called and left this guy a message Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| when the guy was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| And what'd he do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| He give me a bad look again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| It's a different cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| And he giving me bad looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2775)|
| 0:46:15| because I got to get in the left lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| to make a right-hand turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I was talking to a guy today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| on Chapman Highway Golf Range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| and he said he was headed to the Middle East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| to get ready for this next war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| In our lifetime, if you notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| there has always been a war in the election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And to close out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Jim Duncan today said on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| we don't need a Democrat to be president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| for eight more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| If he'd just be a man and just stand up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| just stay out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| We don't need to know he's a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| We don't need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| He just keep that to himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| and keep on doing what he doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2814)|

| 0:47:00| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Well, first of all, I wanna say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| we got some forward thrust on a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| So while we have that forward thrust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| while we have the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| and the mental institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| and law enforcement and the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| once again talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| what we thought we had settled two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| about a safety center pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| and finding a program and the operation costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| and everything going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| I've come before you to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| to be mindful of the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| that are available to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| and the tools that you have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Number one, don't forget those thousand names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| we brought you of the citizens in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| and the county that support a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Some of those people are willing to open centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Some of those people have resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| They're willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I gave the mayor a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Tim Burchett has a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| The governor has a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Pull those out and let's call those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| and let's have some meetings with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Number two, I want you to look into the living room model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| that they use in Dallas, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Number three, I want you to look at the restoration center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| that they're using in San Antonio, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| There are programs for safety centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| that have been going on more than 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and we need to be forward thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| It is time to go ahead and not wait on anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Also, the last thing I want you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| is beginning in 2016, my nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2904)|

| 0:48:34| bringing people in to talk about the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| When we hold those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| I would invite you all to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| And also, a word of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| that the meeting that was held last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| where they had all the different groups come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| to talk about the different mental agencies and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| needed to be announced to the public in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| so that there could be public attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| We don't wanna stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151013?start=2935)|
