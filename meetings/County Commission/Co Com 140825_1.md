| 2:40:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| That's my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| And a motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9649)|

| 2:40:52| He can keep paying that felder when he likes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| We're cutting his card off tomorrow anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| Page 17, resolution 906 is authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| the Industrial Development Board of the County of Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| to accept from markets of Choteau, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| with respect to property located at 1691 Choteau Markets Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| for the purpose of building a new fire hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| in the Choteau area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9681)|
| 2:41:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| Well, as we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| this is a very important item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| As we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| this is to help build the firehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| that Rural Metro will lease from the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| there at Choteau and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| You know, this is one of those but for situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| where this would not go forward but for this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| And the area has very poor coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| We've had at least three major incidents out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| within the last year that would have benefited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| from having services out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| And I'd strongly recommend everybody vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9730)|
| 2:42:11| And I'm glad that Mr. Huber's in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| to hear me speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| Because I've supported your projects in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| and I think you do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| I think you're a quality developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| I think asking for this pilot is not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9745)|
| 2:42:32| I think you can do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| I think you can provide this service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| and still make a healthy profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| Or you and Rural Metro can come into some kind of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| and provide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| I mean, this is about, I know the Rural Metro's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| not for profit or kind of for profit or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| but there's money out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| I think there's money out there without us freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| or doing a payment in lieu of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| or messing with the tax structure in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| to get this process done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| You know, we voted for the one at North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| the little out parcel lots are going for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| We gave them money for a slip exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| You know, we're just, are we gonna ever say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| I guess we said no to Walmart and Hauser before we got on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| or before I got on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Are we gonna ever say no to these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| Are we gonna ever say this is not the appropriate way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9806)|
| 2:43:31| to bargain for our infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| Choteau's a growing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| It's growing because you're doing quality projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| It's growing because you're getting a healthy bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| It's growing because people want to move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| And as people want to move there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| we need to understand the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| and the infrastructure needs to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| And our engineering department's trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| But they keep getting, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| it's hard to do a strategic visioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| of how we want to spend those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| when we keep getting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| these little side bombs coming in here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| Atlas Limited, no, it's not on our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| Okay, but it's a worthy project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| Yeah, folks are moving into Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| They're no more, and honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| they're no more important than the folks in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| other parts of West Knoxville, North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| No more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| I don't care if the houses cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| I really don't care if the houses cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| They're no more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| The folks, as Commissioner Wright said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| that have to, that live close in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| have to have a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| they have to come a long way to get to that close in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| North Knox County or Northeast Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| So, you know, these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9887)|
| 2:44:52| I don't feel are worthy for us to be given pilots or TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9892)|
| 2:44:59| I think they need to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| And then hearing what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| I don't know what Commissioner Briggs is gonna bring next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| I didn't like the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| I didn't like the wording in this yet-to-be-formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| resolution that I can't vote for without seeing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| But I didn't like the initial words he was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| about ownership of this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9918)|
| 2:45:22| or again, I don't wanna speak to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| because I hadn't read anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| so we're gonna deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| we're gonna do the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| we're gonna do the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| We're just gonna do it all for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| That's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| this is not good governing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| This is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| I mean, our mayor is a very conservative person, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| I mean, we cut the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| We kept things tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| Folks have had to tighten up the belts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| and eat part of the shoe leather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| like they do on the belt leather on the cartoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| And we're giving this away to our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| that are most able to take on that extra two or three K| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9958)|
| 2:46:04| or whatever it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| for you to keep your healthy bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| and keep this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| keep this process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| I don't get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| I don't get how this can just sail through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| At some point, we're gonna have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| this is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| If we're gonna be giving these things away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| it need to be for something big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| It needs to be for the big rainmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| to come into Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| and is gonna bring thousands of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| I'm all for giving those folks breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| That's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9995)|
| 2:46:36| We need that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| These folks moving from one place to another place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| and maybe paying 20% more in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| Yeah, that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| But what are they leaving in their wake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| How are we dealing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| How are we dealing with the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| that they're leaving in their wake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| There's a cost for all that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| As we have to grow new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| population shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| we don't wanna close those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| All of that needs to be factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| And on top of all that we're factoring in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| we're giving them stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| We're just giving them stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| So again, Mr. Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| you know I support even your controversial projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| where you needed support and there were tight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| I voted with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| So I like your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| But coming in and asking for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| I got a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| And I'm gonna have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| Commissioner Olenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| Yeah, thank you Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| My only concern with this is not the fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| or even the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| I understand what Commissioner McKenzie's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10062)|
| 2:47:50| My question is basically to Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10070)|
| 2:47:52| that what's our plans out in Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10072)|
| 2:47:57| that was promised a fire station eight years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| and it still hasn't come to fruition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10081)|
| 2:48:04| And we're building a firehouse for 120 homes out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10084)|
| 2:48:09| and we've got response times out in Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10089)|
| 2:48:13| that are 14, 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10093)|
| 2:48:19| We have issues around this other county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| that we're in line first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| And we need to address those as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| because they're having the same problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| with insurances going high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| because they don't have a fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| close enough to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| So they're having to pay high premiums on their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| And I agree with Sam on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| that it's not just, and I represent West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| but it's not about West Knoxville getting everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| We gotta accommodate everybody in the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| And if we're gonna do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| I hope that Rural Metro will keep their agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| with the citizens of Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10138)|
| 2:48:59| and put a Powell fire station out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| And that's what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| Commissioner, I'd, hey Jeff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| they've got a brand new station in Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| right off Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| And in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| they took over the high school fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| So they're covered on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| Wherever there was a promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| there was agreement that one was going to be put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| I've got several calls from the citizens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| Wait a minute, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10165)|
| 2:49:26| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| I guess I have to start by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| thank you, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10174)|
| 2:49:35| for saying that there are locations around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10175)|
| 2:49:42| that suffer with this ISO rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| not just a cherry-picked location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| that we're going to fix today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| Mill Road, off of Millertown, near the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| their ISO rating is low because of the response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10197)|
| 2:50:01| So to see, I'm just saying I'm renewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| my concern from a few days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| to see a flow of dollars that go into the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10208)|
| 2:50:12| general fund being diverted to maybe help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| pick up a driveway for a fire hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| reminds me of going to the fire station that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| in the Gibbs community on Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| It first existed because the community club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| or the RUATAN club in rural metro had an arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| whereby a building was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| And rural metro occupied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| No county dollars, or at least none that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| Maybe someone can correct that if that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| But the point that I'm going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| is that rural metro moved from the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| of Harbinson's to the south side of Harbinson's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| and it needed a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| And the owner of the property or rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| or the bank or someone covered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| getting that driveway from the fire hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| out to Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| I don't remember a need coming before county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| to say we had to fix the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| I say all that only to get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| that we need to talk in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10284)|
| 2:51:29| in the county part of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| the non-incorporated areas, about fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10292)|
| 2:51:37| It's probably the biggest need, the biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10297)|
| 2:51:41| that we seated county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| ought to be considering today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| Because that's something that we will have an impact upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| is the true safety of all the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| not just a few who need a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| so they can have fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| For the same reasons that Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| have expressed, it seems like this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| needs to go further and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| And so I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| that this be deferred at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| Anybody want to speak to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| which is defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10350)|
| 2:52:36| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| Can I ask a question first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10359)|
| 2:52:41| How much money are we talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| involved here in these taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| And two questions, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| Has rural metro stepped up to the plate on any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| as far as taxes are concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| Can I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| I may be able to help on some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| People are thinking we're giving rural metro a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| Rural metro doesn't own fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| They don't own land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| They don't build fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| It's that they lease fire stations from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| And what they do in many of these places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| is that if someone will build a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10396)|
| 2:53:18| that's suitable for them and it's economically feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| because of the subscription rates in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| they'll lease a building and provide fire services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10404)|
| 2:53:28| So rural metro doesn't get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| I don't think rural metro gets a nickel from us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| Rural metro doesn't get tax breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| Rural metro doesn't get any of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| Rural metro's not building this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| Rural metro doesn't own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| Rural metro's not doing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| other than saying we would like to lease a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| and if you'll give us a building, we'll lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| I don't think this has, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| we have other parts of the county that needs fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| And I think those need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| And one of the issues that someone wrote me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| and may have written to other people about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| was let's look at having a county-wide fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| I mean, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| We could raise, we can make a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| in where it'd roughly be three or $400 per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| I mean, per household, per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| We could have a fire service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| just like we have a sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| and do pensions and disability and retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| But I think in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| we can probably do it less expensive to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| by doing things this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| or where there is a place or a building that rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| I can tell you rural metro doesn't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| whether there's a pilot or not a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| because all they want to do is rent the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| And I have no problem at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| on us looking at the other areas that are underserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| because it is a public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| And, you know, we can either raise people's taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| or we can give tax breaks to people to build these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| What I think is important is let's try to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| so we can save lives, save homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| and provide services that we can't provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| We need to look at other parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| And if a building can be built on a piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10512)|
| 2:55:18| and it'd be financially viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| and they can reach an agreement with rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| and there's enough subscribers in that area to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| I think rural metro would do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| and we could probably find a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| We need to do whatever we can to get coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Well, I never realized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| now we're going to be postponing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| but I'd just like to know how much dollar-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| this tax break entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| I think it's in the longer version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| I mean, it's a fair amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10542)|
| 2:55:43| but it's in the longer version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| This is just the abbreviated one that we see right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| Mr. Huber, do you want to come down or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| I mean, I guess the only question I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| are we going to have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| or what are we going to do in the next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| I mean, I'm just asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| what are we going to be doing in the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| that gives any information that we don't have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| other than we're going to have four or five new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| who don't know anything about this at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| I mean, the people that are here right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| know more about it than any other group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10575)|
| 2:56:16| I mean, if we want to vote it down, you know, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10576)|
| 2:56:19| We'll just have a big portion of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| that won't have fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| I mean, in the last year, we've had a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| a house burned to the ground and a motorcycle accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| And the man died, by the way, too, if that means anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10589)|
| 2:56:33| So, but I mean, I wouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| I'm not opposed at all to any area of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| even if we have to give them some pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| or do something else to get coverage that people need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| for the safety of their lives and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| Mr. Huber, what's the, over the life of the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| what is the tax implications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| Or I guess, Doug, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| Todd, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| Todd Napier, I'm here on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| of the County Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| and I'm not here to tell you how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| I'm just here that if it gets passed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| it'll come on to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| But based on the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| that's been provided by Mr. Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| I'm gonna estimate it's gonna be about $8,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| over the course of up to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| 8,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10640)|
| 2:57:21| Yeah, so, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Is that the cost or the savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| That would be the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| And, you know, it's hard to come up with the exact number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| because you don't know exactly how the thing's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| gonna appraise out and what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| But I think that's probably a good number, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| So I would say, why are we even here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| Why is this even before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| I guess I would ask that of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| With that pittance of a sum, why is this before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| John Huber, 213 Fox Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| And those are good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| Trust me, if we didn't have to be here, we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| I mean, because I only like trying to bring things down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| that make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| But, you know, truthfully, I think this is more of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| not a request from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| It's truly a request from the constituents in Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| I mean, when I started the markets at Choteau development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| back in 2009, you know, we zoned it, we did it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| and we built a Wigles out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| but we held off on the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10698)|
| 2:58:19| because the economy wasn't real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10699)|
| 2:58:22| Now we've determined that now it's time to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| But I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| We've got eight lots out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| eight individual building lots in markets at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| Right now we're slated to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| a 5,000-square-foot rural metro on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| and we are slated to build a 5,000-square-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| spec building on another lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| And this is an important distinction, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10725)|
| 2:58:46| because we need the pilot for the rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| We are not requesting a pilot for the other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| or any of the other ones of the other seven lots in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| And the reason being is the numbers just don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| When, you know, rural metro pays about $15 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| That's it, you know, for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| My other tenants pay about $25 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10748)|
| 2:59:13| So that's the difference between it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| And I did some quick calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| You know, in working with Mr. Harnish with rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| and, you know, Commissioner Briggs and everybody with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10760)|
| 2:59:24| we've run a lot of numbers and crunched a lot of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| We've rebid that building three different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| trying to get it in line to where we could absorb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| that last little bit, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| six, seven, $8,000 a year of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| and we just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| I did a quick calculation, and on my side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| we are waiving about $30,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| just to allow rural metro to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| And that's a big part of what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| because I've waived all of the common area maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| if you're familiar with CAM or common area maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| It's deferred maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| It's for where the parking lot tears up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| and you've got to fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| and somebody breaks a curb or hits something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| You've got to, you know, over the course of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| it costs a lot of money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| But in an effort to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10807)|
| 3:00:10| for the people of the Choteau area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10810)|
| 3:00:11| I'd always envisioned markets at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| serving the people of Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| And this, I think, is a great service for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| because they really need the fire service out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| So we did, on our end, everything we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| wiped out all the management fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| all the common area maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| again, which comes out to about $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| And we're so far down, we can't go anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| The bank, Home Federal Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| has approved this loan, as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| with the approval of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| If it does not get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| their loan to build the building cannot be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| because it does not meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10846)|
| 3:00:47| for the regulators for the reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10847)|
| 3:00:51| So everything's pushing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10851)|
| 3:00:52| There's so much downward pressure on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| I've taken everything out that I can take out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10854)|
| 3:00:57| and still have the loan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| And Rural Metro, there's upward pressure on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| because they're paying more rent here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10862)|
| 3:01:03| than they're paying anywhere else in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| So we're so close, but we can't get it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| I mean, really, the way I envision it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| is that over the 15-year pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10872)|
| 3:01:17| it effectively, for the people of the Choteau area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| it allows them to get fire service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| and first responder services out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| instead of having to wait 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| Because what we're doing in the lease is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| okay, we start out here, we'll say flat, with a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| Over the years, we are slowly stepping up the lease rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10897)|
| 3:01:42| Once the lease, or pardon me, once the pilot expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10902)|
| 3:01:47| the lease rate is high enough to pay those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| I mean, because we're graduating the lease income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10913)|
| 3:01:58| that Rural Metro is paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10918)|
| 3:01:59| because they can only pay so much right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| So after 15 years, the pilot expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| but they're paying more in rent to offset the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10924)|
| 3:02:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| Jerry, can you come up here real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| Jerry Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| And while he's coming up there, Sam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| I'm in agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10943)|
| 3:02:24| And John, I love the projects you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| You do excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| And it's really put us in a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| I mean, you go back to sort of what Sam is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10950)|
| 3:02:33| that, you know, you want us to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10953)|
| 3:02:37| Jerry, if you're in, what right now today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| what's your saturation rate in this district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| What percent of the homes are covered with Rural Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| That are subscribers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| In Choteau itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| I don't know, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| Right now, there's almost no incentive for a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| to have a subscription, because the incentive comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10978)|
| 3:03:00| from the insurance premium reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| And those reductions are not available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| where properties are over five miles from a fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| So I don't know the figure, but I know it's quite low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| So with you moving there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10994)|
| 3:03:15| do you anticipate a lot of people signing up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| Yes, because we can compare it to adjoining census tracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=10999)|
| 3:03:24| where there is a fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| Those adjoining census tracts are very similar to Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| in terms of population density and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| And so it's an estimate, but it's a good faith estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11013)|
| 3:03:39| that we believe that the fire station goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| a fairly large percentage of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| will want fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11025)|
| 3:03:46| So how many tracts would that involve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| I don't know the total number of tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| I know the population is 5,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11032)|
| 3:03:56| That population figure was around 802,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| and then jumped to 5,200 in the 2010 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| So we've had roughly another half a decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| since that census was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| I can see both why you guys are asking for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| but then we've got the fiduciary responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11052)|
| 3:04:15| to squeeze everything we can out of the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| So I'm trying to make up my mind what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| So but I say, John, you do great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| You always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11063)|
| 3:04:24| And Jerry, Rural Metro is great for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11064)|
| 3:04:28| You all are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11068)|
| 3:04:29| We're fortunate to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11073)|
| 3:04:36| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| In my quite numerous conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11079)|
| 3:04:42| with both John and Jerry and a few with Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11082)|
| 3:04:48| I don't think this is a major profit center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| for Huber Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| He's expressed to me, and I take him at his word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| and I've seen a few of the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| that it's almost a break-even deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| And I'm not saying it won't enhance his projects at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11100)|
| 3:05:04| by having a power station right in the middle of it, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| But what we had a sunshine meeting about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11108)|
| 3:05:13| Commissioner Briggs and myself out in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| and these gentlemen were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11115)|
| 3:05:16| and numerous constituents were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| and talking about the growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| And he put in just 800 households in 2000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| and over 5,000 now, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| And John's got some numbers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| You gave me the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| I think the insurance premiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| what they went to when the ISO rating goes to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| But these gentlemen are basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| they're not going to get rich on this deal, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| And I mean, I'm not a developer, and they're not a fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11148)|
| 3:05:51| But they're responding to me calling them a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| and I think Commissioner Briggs calling them a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| and lots of constituents out there that have called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| and said, when's it going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11161)|
| 3:06:02| When's it going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11162)|
| 3:06:03| And believe me, I've got calls also from RITA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| I know there's a gap there in RITA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11165)|
| 3:06:09| There's a gap in Powell, as Jeff referenced, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| and I've heard about that last Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| There's numerous gaps throughout Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| but this is just an effort to move this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| to the front of the burner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| and to try to protect property and lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| But, yeah, could you speak to those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| about the growth there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| Yeah, we did some estimated numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| In the application to the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| there's a letter included from one of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| down Choteau Road who actually lived right beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| one of the houses that burned to the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| because the response time was too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11203)|
| 3:06:44| So they were quoted in their, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| their insurance rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| because they're classified as a Class 10 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| their insurance rates have gone up $542 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11213)|
| 3:06:59| If you extrapolate that out over the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| in a three-mile radius and assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| that the same thing has happened to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| and I've had, I'm telling you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| you know, my office is out there on the corner now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| and I bet you weekly I get people coming by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| and knocking on the door saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| hey, what can you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11235)|
| 3:07:16| Our insurance rates are high here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| Something's going on out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| And I say, yeah, I'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| but there's a lot of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| there are a lot of pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11243)|
| 3:07:24| But if you do the numbers of how many households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| how many homes are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| and times the $542 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11249)|
| 3:07:33| it comes out to about $3 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| I think that's what you were asking, Commissioner Shouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| of higher tax rates that people are paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11258)|
| 3:07:41| because there is no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11261)|
| 3:07:42| Higher insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11262)|
| 3:07:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| Because there is no fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| technically, out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11267)|
| 3:07:48| But, yeah, to speak to your other comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| this is certainly not a big profit center for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| It's, yeah, do I think I'll get an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| out of the synergy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| And, you know, building two buildings at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11280)|
| 3:08:03| is certainly better than building one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11283)|
| 3:08:07| But the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| But overall, it's really community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11288)|
| 3:08:12| And, again, I mean, that's why I waived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| all the common area maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| all the management fees, everything out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| to the tune of about $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| We're talking about the county abating $7,000 or $8,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11301)|
| 3:08:26| This isn't money that's already being put into the coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| This is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| There's no money there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| I mean, the taxes will be frozen at what they are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| what I'm paying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| And if it didn't come through, then there's no taxes anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11318)|
| 3:08:42| You know, if the fire hall's not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| there's no taxes going into the coffers anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11324)|
| 3:08:48| So, yeah, I mean, we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11328)|
| 3:08:52| You know, I'm not trying to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| This is a very small project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| That's the unusual thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| I mean, it's usually when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11336)|
| 3:08:57| as Commissioner McKenzie said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| a big $100 million deal coming down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| you know, and I'm all for those, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| We need to move Knoxville forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| Unfortunately, this is a smaller deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| but it's more about health and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11348)|
| 3:09:10| and life issues in the Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11350)|
| 3:09:12| You know, us abating the $30,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11352)|
| 3:09:16| Knox County kicking in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| abating the $7,000 or so a year in taxes, the deal works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11358)|
| 3:09:23| But if either one of those get out of line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| then the numbers just don't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| and we can't get the loan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| Yeah, I just thought it was a razor thin for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| And what you had mentioned to me on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| about giving up your fees, your management fee and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| I mean, usually people rent something in rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| that they make up to have a profit margin in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11382)|
| 3:09:43| So I think I recall you saying how razor thin it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| if not a break-even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| And obviously, the county-wide fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| is a discussion for a future county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11392)|
| 3:09:56| I hope very future or very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11396)|
| 3:09:58| But if this were to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| it just continues to delay the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| The pieces have fallen into place so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| I mean, I was surprised, frankly, with Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| You know, I talked to Home Federal three weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| and six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11409)|
| 3:10:10| and then I heard they did come around contingent upon this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11410)|
| 3:10:14| So it's a lot of pieces had to fall into the puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| just right on this one or it falls apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| and we're talking about it in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11420)|
| 3:10:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| You know, I think you guys are making my point beautifully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11425)|
| 3:10:29| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| Folks are paying a lot more in insurance increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11431)|
| 3:10:38| So as we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11438)|
| 3:10:40| and again, I don't want to get into your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| but by that same token,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11442)|
| 3:10:44| you guys are kind of dragging us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| So $15 per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| I think Rural Metro can sharpen their pencil and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| you know, if we come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| we're going to get an incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11455)|
| 3:10:56| because these folks are now going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11456)|
| 3:10:59| they're going to have a margin on that $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| or whatever price you quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| We can sharpen our pencil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11465)|
| 3:11:06| and take that dollar value per square foot up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11466)|
| 3:11:10| You can sharpen yours and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11470)|
| 3:11:12| I'm going to have an ISO number, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| and that's going to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| That's going to help me with these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| large square footage developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| that are probably waiting on this deal to come through as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| That's going to help me sell my residential piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| So again, you know, so I might be able to lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| and we can come to a happy meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11493)|
| 3:11:36| whether it's $8,000 or however much per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| I forgot what Todd quoted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| Yeah, $8,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| I think small sum can come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| Again, I'll quote Commissioner Bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| He often says, we don't have so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| No one in Knox County is really wanting to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11515)|
| 3:11:59| They don't make land anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| We're not growing as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| There's only so many, you know, plots that we got left out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11523)|
| 3:12:08| And so, yeah, I know we're just talking about a little bit here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| They're not making any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| We don't have any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| So we need to be as frugal and judicious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11534)|
| 3:12:18| with what we have left to develop as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11538)|
| 3:12:22| And I just think this is going to set a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| And the last thing you said in your conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11546)|
| 3:12:30| with Commissioner Shouse is we got to keep the community in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11550)|
| 3:12:36| And that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11556)|
| 3:12:37| That's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11557)|
| 3:12:38| But when I say community, I'm talking Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| So in answer to what we'll do maybe 30 days as Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11562)|
| 3:12:47| and I seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11567)|
| 3:12:48| I just think there does need to be a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| But I think we need to have a greater conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11571)|
| 3:12:56| I think this is a cherry-picked thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| and I don't think we've shown due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| to see what number one fire protection in Knox County is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| So this might be a time thing, but time will be just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11587)|
| 3:13:13| Choteau will be a nice development 30 days from now, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| So I just really encourage us to let's hold off on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11599)|
| 3:13:24| Let's maybe form a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| I'll turn to the Chair and ask him in the next 30 days or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11606)|
| 3:13:31| let's take a look at where Knox County fire protection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11611)|
| 3:13:35| If it's 60 days, that might be more in tune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| But let's not move out on this because it kind of hamstrings us at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11618)|
| 3:13:43| If we move out here, we've locked in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| and now we've set a precedent on how we deal with fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11624)|
| 3:13:48| and folks in Northeast may say, hey, you did it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| You may need to do it in my area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| So I think this can be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11635)|
| 3:13:59| This is a good conversation that we're having about fire protection in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11639)|
| 3:14:03| We've all been hit with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| I'm a city commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| I've been hit with it, and my heart goes out because fire protection is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| It's a big, important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| So I just think we need to really do it wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11653)|
| 3:14:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11657)|
| 3:14:18| I'm going to speak against delaying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| We've really had this discussion going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| It will soon be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| We started off with looking at a piece of property on Holder Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| that had been deeded over 100 years ago to build a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11670)|
| 3:14:35| and that didn't work out because I think the last owner we could locate moved to Florida in 1932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11675)|
| 3:14:42| And then we looked at a piece of property across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11682)|
| 3:14:45| It was sort of an odd angle property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| but there was some sort of dispute going on between the developer who owned that last piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11687)|
| 3:14:53| and the residents about where they had built a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11693)|
| 3:14:58| And really this was just about going down to our last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| We even looked at taking some of the parkland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| but because that parkland on the lake had been deeded to the county for a park from TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11705)|
| 3:15:11| to be used for recreational purposes only, that didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| So we've had nearly a two-year discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| and I would really hate to see us say that there's another part of the county that doesn't have good fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11718)|
| 3:15:25| and because they don't have good fire service, we're going to deny it to this part of the county for $8,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11725)|
| 3:15:32| I really think if you did a cost analysis on these other areas that don't have good fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11732)|
| 3:15:39| I think we ought to do something for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| If we could get all of these, if there's a half a dozen or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| and we could get those fixed for $8,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| I think that's a pretty good bargain for the citizens that don't have fire and first responder service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11746)|
| 3:15:53| I mean, the fire does more than just put out fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| They're the first responders while we're waiting for ambulances to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| And I really think if you did a cost analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| that would be a lot less expensive than trying to have a countywide fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11763)|
| 3:16:08| because there's so much involved in that that I mentioned just a few minutes earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| We're starting with, we're going to have four new commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11773)|
| 3:16:17| We're not going to have our reorganizational meeting, I believe, until the 8th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11777)|
| 3:16:22| Every bit of the knowledge, every bit of the discussion that we've had on this over the last two years is going to be lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11782)|
| 3:16:30| and we're going to be starting all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| We're not talking about someone making a lot of profit off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| All we're talking about now is saving lives and property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| and I don't think because someone else has it we should deny these people out there that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11801)|
| 3:16:47| I think we need to do this one, and then we need to go ahead and have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| If we can get four or five more areas covered for $8,000 a year, I think that's a pretty good deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11811)|
| 3:16:56| and I would hope that we'll vote against this, and let's go ahead and vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11816)|
| 3:17:01| Right now, I think we have the most knowledge on this commission about the issue now that we need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| John, you've got your calculator on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| I've got a phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11832)|
| 3:17:13| I figure that's what I'm up here plugging away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| Figure the $15 a square foot, what's the payment versus the $25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11836)|
| 3:17:25| It's a difference of $10 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11845)|
| 3:17:29| Yeah, so that's $50,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11849)|
| 3:17:34| For $15 or the difference between the two of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| Yeah, the building is 5,000 feet, so if you've got 15 times 5,000, that gives you 75,000 or 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11858)|
| 3:17:50| I come up at 49,992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| Is that about right at 50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11873)|
| 3:17:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11878)|
| 3:17:59| Yeah, so that's the difference between what the other tenants are expected to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11879)|
| 3:18:04| which we're not asking for any assistance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| Again, it's just over here in this special situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| And, again, out of that, I mean, personally, we're waiving about $30,000 of that because it's all common area maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11891)|
| 3:18:17| and I'm hoping it doesn't, with those heavy fire trucks coming in and out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11897)|
| 3:18:20| I really, really am hoping it doesn't come back to bite us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| But I look at it much like the commissioners do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| I'm part of the community out there, too, and I'm part of the broader community, Mr. McKenzie, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11907)|
| 3:18:32| But I know what it needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| I live out there, and I get a tremendous amount of people calling and stopping by and wanting to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11915)|
| 3:18:42| Again, but I'd always envisioned markets at Choteau as being kind of a central area for the people of Choteau to service all their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11922)|
| 3:18:51| And I think a fire hall is a good addition to that if it's financially feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11931)|
| 3:18:58| If it's not, then it's just not meant to be as a fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11938)|
| 3:19:02| Jerry, do you want to be out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11942)|
| 3:19:07| How bad do you want rural metro out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| I would think you'd want to me it sounded like a lot of cherry picking that you could do out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11950)|
| 3:19:15| No, there are no cherries out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| We'll be lucky to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| Quite frankly, if we had to pay more for rent at this location, the only way to do it would be to reduce spending in some other area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11958)|
| 3:19:27| I heard that same thing at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11967)|
| 3:19:32| You just said that not many people were subscribing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| And if you were out there, then they would subscribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| If a man had a building built for you and you weren't ready to move today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11977)|
| 3:19:46| John, you've not started any construction at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11986)|
| 3:19:51| You're just waiting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11991)|
| 3:19:52| Well, yeah, this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| But that brings up an important thing that I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| And all due respect to Commissioner Norman and Mr. McKenzie, a delay is likely to blow it up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=11997)|
| 3:20:04| As Dr. Briggs had mentioned, we've truly been working on this thing for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12004)|
| 3:20:10| And you had suggested, let's get our pencils out and sharpen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12010)|
| 3:20:13| How bad does rural metro want to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12013)|
| 3:20:14| How bad does Huber want them out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| But we have sharpened them and sharpened them and sharpened them some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| Like I said, we bid this building three times in an effort and reduced sizes and pulled in and reworked it, all in an effort to make it cheaper to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12021)|
| 3:20:31| So the loan would be smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12031)|
| 3:20:32| So the rent would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| So everything was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| I mean, we have worked this thing and worked this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| Home Federal has a rate lock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| They've got the loan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12040)|
| 3:20:41| It's ready to close the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12041)|
| 3:20:44| My commitment letter from them says it must be closed by the end of September or the deal is off the table effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12044)|
| 3:20:50| They have to take it back through loan committees and do everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| The problem with that is then we're going to be pushed into the wet season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12053)|
| 3:20:57| And then we're not going to be able to construct until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12057)|
| 3:21:00| You know, there's just a lot of issues with not moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| And, again, as Dr. Briggs had mentioned, we've been working on this thing for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12064)|
| 3:21:10| And, again, I want to reiterate, and I think most of you know this, that I wouldn't be down here asking for something like this if it wasn't this close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12070)|
| 3:21:17| You know, it's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12077)|
| 3:21:20| It's just that close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Neither one of us can go anywhere, it seems right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| So that's where the request is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12086)|
| 3:21:30| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| I'm sure commission in its wisdom will do the right thing in this, whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12092)|
| 3:21:37| But if it's the delay, I believe we're talking about it in the spring, the stars have had to align just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12097)|
| 3:21:44| And these guys really have just responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| I've bugged them a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| I have both of them on my, you know, quick call now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| I've bugged them a lot about it simply because constituents have bugged me and said, you know, we're left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12112)|
| 3:21:58| Let's get this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Let's get this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| And it's such a small, I shouldn't say small, $8,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12121)|
| 3:22:07| And Dr. Briggs stole my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| If we could fix Rita, Powell, and everywhere else that is lacking in fire service, be it through rural metro or a hybrid or a Carnes volunteer or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12129)|
| 3:22:22| for $8,000 a year, we would be derelict in our duties if we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12142)|
| 3:22:27| I mean, if we could provide service countywide for $8,000 four or five places, we should do it next weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12147)|
| 3:22:34| But nevertheless, I share Dr. Briggs' viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| I think this thing should be voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| And if it stalls here, you've got these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12159)|
| 3:22:45| You start on Rita tomorrow, I believe it will be three years from now because you've got to have the land, you've got to have a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12165)|
| 3:22:51| you've got to have a willing fire provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| and you've got to have somebody with some money like a home federal and convince them what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12173)|
| 3:22:57| And you've got the cash flow to pay them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| So nevertheless, I support voting it up or down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| All right, the motion on the floor is to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| Let's do a roll call vote starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12186)|
| 3:23:14| Commissioner McKenzie. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12196)|

| 3:23:20| Commissioner Broyles votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| Commissioner Norman. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12204)|
| 3:23:25| Commissioner Ombi. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| Commissioner Ombi votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| Commissioner Briggs. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12208)|
| 3:23:29| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12209)|
| 3:23:30| Commissioner Anders. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| Commissioner Smith. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| Commissioner Wright. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12218)|
| 3:23:39| Commissioner Brown. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12221)|
| 3:23:42| Commissioner Hammond. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| Commissioner Hammond votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12224)|
| 3:23:45| Commissioner Shouse. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| All right, it's 9-2, the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| So we're back to the original motion of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12233)|
| 3:23:56| We have a motion on the floor in a second, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| We do, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12240)|
| 3:24:03| No. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12247)|
| 3:24:08| Commissioner McKenzie and Commissioner Broyles, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| 9-2, motion passes, it is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12253)|
| 3:24:20| Resolution 907 is a resolution to provide for the reimbursement of the travel expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12260)|
| 3:24:27| of the commissioners elect to attend the county officials orientation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12267)|
| 3:24:31| to be held in Murfreesboro from August 26 through 28, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12271)|
| 3:24:36| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12278)|
| 3:24:39| There's a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12279)|
| 3:24:40| This allows us to pay for the orientation for the new guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12280)|
| 3:24:44| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12284)|
| 3:24:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12286)|
| 3:24:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12289)|
| 3:24:54| Dr. Briggs, do we need to add that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| Yeah, that's, you know, we, the letter, and we could let the law director address this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12296)|
| 3:25:01| The letter really doesn't carry a whole lot of legal weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| but I believe that Home Federal wanted to have that because it just shows that if rural metro moves out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12304)|
| 3:25:12| or in some way we change the relationship for the fire service with someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12312)|
| 3:25:17| we decide to have a county fire service, someone else comes in as another vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12317)|
| 3:25:21| we'll do what we can to see if it, to try to put it in that single-use facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12321)|
| 3:25:27| Does that need to be voted on, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12327)|
| 3:25:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| All right, what we need to do is, by three-quarters of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12335)|
| 3:25:39| to add this item to give me permission to draft a letter with the law department to send to Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12339)|
| 3:25:45| I will say this is non, it really doesn't carry a whole lot of legal weight, I think, is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| He's saying it's non-binding, it doesn't hold us in any liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12350)|
| 3:25:53| So is there a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12356)|
| 3:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12357)|
| 3:26:00| Is this to write a letter on county letterhead from the chair of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12360)|
| 3:26:07| With the approval of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12367)|
| 3:26:13| Are you leaving, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| Are you leaving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12375)|
| 3:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| All right, there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12377)|

| 3:28:20| Discussion regarding Knox County Schools funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12500)|
| 3:28:24| Commissioner Norton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12504)|
| 3:28:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12506)|
| 3:28:27| This has been a long, emotional meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12507)|
| 3:28:31| I'm conflicted about how much to talk about this, of course, because I talked about it once already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12511)|
| 3:28:39| There's lots and lots of reasons, I think, to take a real detailed look at the business aspect of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12519)|
| 3:28:51| Some people would call that a forensic look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| That's going to be up to the audit committee and to the people that are most familiar with the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12533)|
| 3:28:59| with the mayor, with the new commission, whoever thinks this is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12539)|
| 3:29:04| I do feel like I do need to say a couple of things, so I'll try to make it as fast as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12544)|
| 3:29:09| I brought up Mr. Suttle last time that started the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12549)|
| 3:29:15| I got a couple of responses, invoices from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12555)|
| 3:29:20| I think based on those responses and then what I can determine, the cost from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12560)|
| 3:29:26| that Mr. Suttle is somewhere in the range of at least $25,000 for his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12566)|
| 3:29:32| And then, of course, another side of that is the vindictive nature, I think, of the administration in terms of his assignment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12572)|
| 3:29:43| Here he is, a fairly accomplished math teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12583)|
| 3:29:46| He's been placed at Willow Springs Middle School in a gym teaching health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12586)|
| 3:29:53| So that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| I talked about payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| I mentioned payroll and the fairly famous sabotage of the Lawson system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12599)|
| 3:30:05| and the combination of our payroll, of the school system payroll, into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12605)|
| 3:30:11| We've got Ms. Needham's two years paid leave unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12611)|
| 3:30:17| There's lots of issues in terms of consultant fees for retired principal supervisors, former Board of Education members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12617)|
| 3:30:27| There's, within the payroll that's been fairly well known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12627)|
| 3:30:31| there's been abuse of vacation and sick leave within the administrative aspects of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12631)|
| 3:30:39| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12639)|
| 3:30:40| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12640)|
| 3:30:41| Should it be looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| That would be a place, certainly, for a detailed look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12643)|
| 3:30:48| Has there, within payroll, during the race to the top monies, were there surpluses in expenditures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12648)|
| 3:30:57| And if there were surpluses, how were those surpluses treated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12657)|
| 3:31:03| Were there bonuses paid to high-level officials in the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12663)|
| 3:31:10| We're familiar with the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12670)|
| 3:31:12| The last five-year plan got us an all-time low in ACT, and 20% of our students are college and college career ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12672)|
| 3:31:23| So it's certainly the issue of performance related to budget and funding has got to continue with this next commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12683)|
| 3:31:36| Just the reflexive addition of natural growth every year to the budget of the school system is just unwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12696)|
| 3:31:47| especially in the light of all the other departments in the county budgets being virtually flat during this past seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12707)|
| 3:31:57| and the school system continues to grow and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12717)|
| 3:32:00| And I think, and many think, in terms of it's primarily an administrative function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12720)|
| 3:32:06| The teachers in the classroom, they don't feel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12726)|
| 3:32:10| The mayor funded almost $3 million a year for a reading program three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12730)|
| 3:32:18| It's $8.5 million now, and we just learned that the reading scores have actually gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12738)|
| 3:32:27| We had our last year an example of, I think, gross mismanagement in terms of administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12747)|
| 3:32:34| in terms of the security debacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12754)|
| 3:32:38| A high-level official in the county government, of course, had a relationship with a PSCD official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12758)|
| 3:32:47| It ended up with us either having nonexistent or inoperative security systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12767)|
| 3:32:54| to which we now have spent, in FY14 and FY15, $3.9 million and $3.875 million in the last two years to remedy those deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12774)|
| 3:33:09| North Shore Elementary is an interesting case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| All the way from the purchase of the land to the building of this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12793)|
| 3:33:19| it was riddled with sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12799)|
| 3:33:23| The wing of the school caved in, or was about to cave in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12803)|
| 3:33:28| to the extent that there had to be an underground dam built for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12808)|
| 3:33:34| This is another example of how the system is really mismanaged in terms of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12814)|
| 3:33:42| I don't know. There was kind of a clever thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12822)|
| 3:33:49| One of our county officials said that the east wing is now called the Brad Pitt wing because a river runs through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12829)|
| 3:33:59| I thought that was kind of clever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| Anyway, I hope the folks at Northwest or at North Shore Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12841)|
| 3:34:07| do not suffer some catastrophic loss because of the inattention to very simple geotech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12847)|
| 3:34:18| which should have been done beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12858)|
| 3:34:22| That was to the tune of some $700,000 that had been spent of the contingency monies of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12862)|
| 3:34:31| The PPU count keeps going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12871)|
| 3:34:35| We don't know what's going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| but basically we do know that the PPU has been used to fund projects inappropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12877)|
| 3:34:46| It's a great way to hide overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12886)|
| 3:34:53| We know that capital money is being plussed in there for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12893)|
| 3:34:57| Then you just can't keep up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| It's very hard to keep up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| We're going to get a report from Ms. Williams about that eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12901)|
| 3:35:06| All in all, I think that it's way past time of having a close look at the business function of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12906)|
| 3:35:16| I'm not talking about the educational component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12916)|
| 3:35:21| I think it's a shame so much money is being spent administratively in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12921)|
| 3:35:30| These are examples, and there's more, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12930)|
| 3:35:35| Hopefully the next commission, Mr. Mayor will attend to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12935)|
| 3:35:41| We'll be about educating children instead of wasting so much money administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12941)|
| 3:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12948)|
| 3:35:49| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12949)|
| 3:35:50| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12950)|
| 3:35:53| I'm not going to rebut anything Tony has said because I respect his points of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12953)|
| 3:35:59| and the things he's brought to our attention over the last years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12959)|
| 3:36:03| There have been some audits in the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12963)|
| 3:36:10| Our previous outside auditor and our current outside auditor do go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| Obviously, it's $460 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| It's more than double the size of the rest of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12977)|
| 3:36:20| so it would take a team of auditors to be over there constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12980)|
| 3:36:24| That would be okay if the future county commissions want to fund endeavors like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12984)|
| 3:36:32| The School Activities Fund have been audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12992)|
| 3:36:36| Of course, that's a lot smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| That's coupon books and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=12998)|
| 3:36:40| There have been audits over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13000)|
| 3:36:43| To just touch briefly on a forensic audit, as I, in my limited knowledge of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13003)|
| 3:36:51| would be looking toward a specific somebody took a million dollars from the race to the top money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13011)|
| 3:36:59| and it went to Carter Elementary and it's supposed to go to race for teachers enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13019)|
| 3:37:08| I mean, if you can find it, again, I'm no expert on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13028)|
| 3:37:12| but I think you need a specific accusation or say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13032)|
| 3:37:18| this is where I want the forensic audit to be concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| instead of just to send Andrea over there, a peeing company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13042)|
| 3:37:26| with a blank check and just start auditing the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13046)|
| 3:37:29| Again, it's $460, who knows, $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13049)|
| 3:37:33| Massive amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13053)|
| 3:37:34| Too big for me to myself to even imagine over a million dollars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13054)|
| 3:37:41| And so, sure, we need auditing personnel over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| and I hope future audit committees and future commissions will direct the auditors over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13065)|
| 3:37:51| Maybe direct the outside auditors over there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| But, again, that's my opinion of a forensic audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13073)|
| 3:37:56| I think it would need to be sort of a tunnel, this is what you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| and obviously not necessarily policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13080)|
| 3:38:04| And, again, I understand and agree with many of the things Commissioner Norman says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| and I hear too many administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13088)|
| 3:38:11| It's not a week that goes by that I don't hear too many administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13091)|
| 3:38:14| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| I'm not the person to make that decision, and I doubt Andrea Williams is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13096)|
| 3:38:20| I mean, that's more of a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13100)|
| 3:38:22| But I just wanted to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13102)|
| 3:38:27| The audit committee hasn't just totally let the school system do what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| and spend money as they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| There has been some checks and balances over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13113)|
| 3:38:36| Commissioner Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13116)|
| 3:38:37| Yeah, I was just going to make a comment, I think, on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13117)|
| 3:38:40| If something like that was to be done, it would need to go to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13120)|
| 3:38:45| and then they would review it and decide, you know, what magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13125)|
| 3:38:49| and what they would focus on, I think, just for people that may be listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13129)|
| 3:38:54| is that that would be our process if something was decided by a future commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13134)|
| 3:38:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13139)|
| 3:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13142)|
| 3:39:03| You know, Commissioner Norman, I've been on the opposite side of a lot of these educational issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13143)|
| 3:39:08| but he's absolutely right in a lot of what he was saying today, in what he said today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13148)|
| 3:39:17| And hopefully he'll have the assurance that once he leaves this body that we won't pull out the rubber stamp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13157)|
| 3:39:26| and go back or go to a, you know, if you present it, we'll pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13166)|
| 3:39:32| I don't think that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| It's not going to happen, I guess I'll say, on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| You know, while our methods may be, you know, a tad different as it relates to dealing with the AJ building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13177)|
| 3:39:47| I think we share the same end goal, and I agree with what you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13187)|
| 3:39:56| and then how Commissioner Schall said to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13196)|
| 3:40:01| I think there's some issues over there from the business aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13201)|
| 3:40:06| but I do think it needs to be targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13206)|
| 3:40:08| We don't they can't print enough money for us to go over there and just say audit them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13208)|
| 3:40:14| and let's find out where all the skeletons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13214)|
| 3:40:17| So how we get there, I don't know, but I think you brought up a couple of examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13217)|
| 3:40:23| of some things we need to take a look at, and those I will encourage the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13223)|
| 3:40:32| this next commission, to allow us to continue that or the next chair of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13232)|
| 3:40:38| but I do think it needs to be a targeted thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13238)|
| 3:40:41| You know, if it's this project that we heard monies were diverted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13241)|
| 3:40:45| or this person we heard is, you know, getting some type of, you know, unfair or extra funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13245)|
| 3:40:59| that's probably how we need to attack it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13259)|
| 3:41:02| So I just want to say, you know, as it relates to educating our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13262)|
| 3:41:09| we need to as a commission keep, and it just makes for a good system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13269)|
| 3:41:16| I think that's why we have this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| We have to hold the Board of Education school board accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13278)|
| 3:41:23| They have to hold us accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| It's okay to have that natural friction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13286)|
| 3:41:29| That's why, you know, I tell people it's okay for us not to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13289)|
| 3:41:32| just go out and have dinner and drinks every night, but by that same token,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13292)|
| 3:41:39| we still got to continue the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13299)|
| 3:41:42| We got to do it, you know, disagree without being too disagreeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| and hopefully we'll get a system that we can all be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13305)|
| 3:41:51| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13311)|
| 3:41:52| And I think that was what you said, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| We're not there yet, and I couldn't agree with you more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13319)|
| 3:42:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13320)|
| 3:42:01| Thank you, and thank you, Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13321)|
| 3:42:09| I think that in my discussions about the topic with Dr. Casello, there's a number of ways to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13329)|
| 3:42:19| and so I'm going to leave that to you guys in the Audit Committee to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13339)|
| 3:42:26| Certainly the detailed look into certain aspects of the business function are due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13346)|
| 3:42:33| As Sam said, our business or the school system's business is educating kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13353)|
| 3:42:39| I think a lot of times it's just gotten so much beyond that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13359)|
| 3:42:44| in terms of facilities and facility management, project management, all these types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13364)|
| 3:42:51| It drains a lot of effort from our primary task of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| PILOT sells cigarettes, food, and gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13377)|
| 3:43:03| Their HR is run by Cynthia Moxley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13383)|
| 3:43:08| I think a lot of these functions of the school system need to be run by somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13388)|
| 3:43:14| and let's stick to the education part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| Let's get them focused on that, and I think we'll be a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13397)|
| 3:43:21| HR or PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Sorry, PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13405)|
| 3:43:26| Ms. Moxley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13406)|
| 3:43:27| Excuse me, Ms. Moxley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| But that's the key, is to get their focus back on their primary mission, which is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13411)|
| 3:43:39| We all agree on that, all of us, the board, the commission, the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13419)|
| 3:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13424)|
| 3:43:46| All right, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13426)|
| 3:43:50| Our next item is discussion regarding the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13430)|
| 3:43:54| I think we spoke with Andrea a little bit today at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13434)|
| 3:43:58| I think the PPU audit is still in its final stages and hopefully to be released soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13438)|
| 3:44:04| I don't know that she's got a definite date of review on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13444)|
| 3:44:08| Does anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13448)|
| 3:44:13| By memo, she told us sometime in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13453)|
| 3:44:17| I wasn't part of her conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| Yeah, I think that's her hope, is to have it before September, around September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13459)|
| 3:44:24| And then the closeout audits, the two closeout audits she does is going to be fairly quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13464)|
| 3:44:29| and so we'll get reports on those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| I believe that she's doing the two judges' audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13471)|
| 3:44:35| May I mention a couple of things, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| Really, back to the last one, but this one also, because of the massive size of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13479)|
| 3:44:47| some random audits have all, really about all that's been able to do at random,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13487)|
| 3:44:51| just going in unannounced and auditing something instead of a go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13491)|
| 3:44:56| and like the pension fund is being audited now when they knew they were coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13496)|
| 3:44:59| and they'll spend six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| But I think the random audits will continue, hopefully will continue, and need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| A couple of things that I hope, again, future audit committees will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| and future commissions will keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13509)|
| 3:45:13| They need the second outside person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| We've been without an outside financial person for almost a year now, and that needs to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13517)|
| 3:45:25| Yeah, we're going to try to plug that in in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| That would really, because you could run a risk of not having a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13528)|
| 3:45:33| Chris, is it the Comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13533)|
| 3:45:36| The Comptroller has come up with an audit of the TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13536)|
| 3:45:42| and has thrown this sort of an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13542)|
| 3:45:45| Is it the Comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| The Comptroller's office is asking for help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13547)|
| 3:45:51| and our external auditor is looking at certain things about TCRS as it relates to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13551)|
| 3:46:00| They're doing that across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13560)|
| 3:46:02| but I think in 90 of the 95 counties are done by county audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13562)|
| 3:46:08| There's only five that have our own external auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13568)|
| 3:46:11| And so one of the questions is going to be that we're going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13571)|
| 3:46:14| and so is our external auditors, on our behalf, is do we bill the state for this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13574)|
| 3:46:22| Because the state's asking us to do it, so it's something that we shouldn't have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13582)|
| 3:46:28| The state is asking our external auditors to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13588)|
| 3:46:32| I don't think it's something that we should have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| I think the state should pick up that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13594)|
| 3:46:36| That's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13596)|
| 3:46:37| We'll see if they agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13597)|
| 3:46:40| Okay, and that's TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13600)|
| 3:46:41| That's primary teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13603)|
| 3:46:44| It would be that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13604)|
| 3:46:47| And you mentioned the closeouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13607)|
| 3:46:48| and the closeouts will be done by Pew and Company for Trustee and Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| But Andrea for the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13613)|
| 3:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13614)|
| 3:46:55| Because of a potential conflict, we're technically her boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13615)|
| 3:46:59| At the time, she didn't have any employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13619)|
| 3:47:03| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13623)|
| 3:47:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13624)|
| 3:47:05| I just want to reiterate a comment that I had made three months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13625)|
| 3:47:11| regarding something that Commissioner Schaust has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13631)|
| 3:47:14| that we're still lacking that other outside person on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13634)|
| 3:47:21| And my question at that point was, is under their charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13641)|
| 3:47:24| are they legally constituted at this time if they don't have at least the name on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13644)|
| 3:47:31| I think they're legally constituted because they have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13651)|
| 3:47:34| But we're going to get that person added in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13654)|
| 3:47:37| Because you won't have a quorum in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13657)|
| 3:47:41| They have a quorum, but legally they are not a fully constituted committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13661)|
| 3:47:47| if they don't have the number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13667)|
| 3:47:50| We're going to plug that hole in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| Any other items on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13674)|
| 3:47:55| One more discussion item, Commissioner Hammond's addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13675)|
| 3:48:00| I wanted to hand this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13680)|
| 3:48:01| In my discussions with the schools a few months ago, I just asked the question offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13681)|
| 3:48:06| I said, what does it cost to operate a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13686)|
| 3:48:09| And they have spent quite a bit of time getting me this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13689)|
| 3:48:13| and I appreciate your bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| I'm not making any comments, but I wanted to hand this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13695)|
| 3:48:18| because they have listed every school, all elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13698)|
| 3:48:21| every middle school, every high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| and they've broken it down for instruction and instruction support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13703)|
| 3:48:26| the office of the principal, utilities, custodial, student transportation, materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13706)|
| 3:48:31| general purpose budget, and then federal funding and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13711)|
| 3:48:34| I think you might find it interesting as you look at schools in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13714)|
| 3:48:37| And let me give this to Jolie so she can start passing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| Schools in your district, you'll be able to see what it costs to operate a school in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13720)|
| 3:48:47| And as you might imagine, it's different depending on how many students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| depending on the largeness of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13730)|
| 3:48:52| and it costs more to operate a high school than it does an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13732)|
| 3:48:55| But anyway, it's very interesting information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13735)|
| 3:48:58| I just wanted you to have access to it because they did provide it to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13738)|
| 3:49:01| and I wanted to make sure that you had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| Any other items that come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13746)|
| 3:49:08| Before you leave, we need to recreate that picture because Commissioner Brown was not with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13748)|
| 3:49:15| So we need to get the four chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| And then we're going to adjourn this meeting, get the four chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| and at 5.15 we'll bring back the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13764)|
| 3:49:25| You better hurry because it's been a long time since 2.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=13765)|

| 4:18:00| from BP Business and Technology and TO Technology Overlay to PR Plan Residential and TO Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15480)|

| 4:18:13| west of Thompson Road in the 6th Commission District. Is the applicant here? Arthur Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15493)|

| 4:18:33| it before we have a motion? Arthur, if you would like to go ahead and get started. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15513)|
| 4:18:42| I mentioned, I am Arthur Seymour Jr. I am here on behalf of the applicant. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15522)|
| 4:18:47| request to rezone 12 acres of property off of Hardin Valley Road adjacent to BP Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15527)|
| 4:18:56| and Technology Overlay. Adjacent to property Mr. Garrett owns that is already zoned OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15536)|
| 4:19:04| from TO Plan Residential and up to 8.5 units per acre. This is the number that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15544)|
| 4:19:12| Commission staff recommended and the Planning Commission itself. After applying slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15552)|
| 4:19:20| to the area, this is the figure they arrived at. The sector plan for this property allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15560)|
| 4:19:30| commercial, office, and medium density residential. Medium density residential under the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15570)|
| 4:19:37| ordinance is roughly 6 units up to 12 units per acre. Mr. Garrett asked for 12 units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15577)|
| 4:19:45| acre, but MPC after doing the slope analysis and considering the slope protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15585)|
| 4:19:54| suggested 8.5, which Mr. Garrett is fine with. This is 30% less than his request. This area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15594)|
| 4:20:03| is in the Technology Carter overlay zone. I know there is opposition from the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15603)|
| 4:20:11| immediately adjoining to the south. The technology overlay zone has a setback of 100 feet from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15611)|
| 4:20:21| the closest residential property. So we are dealing with that. It could be more, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15621)|
| 4:20:27| is the minimum that it is set back. If the rezoning is granted, Mr. Garrett will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15627)|
| 4:20:35| to go back to the MPC to file a use zone review since this is a planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15635)|
| 4:20:44| He will also have to go to the Technology Carter Development Authority for review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15644)|
| 4:20:50| approval of any plan of development of the property. So there are multiple levels. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15650)|
| 4:20:58| has offered, in addition to the 100 foot setback, to agree to a 40 foot no build line against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15658)|
| 4:21:10| the subdivision to the south. That is no disturbance area 40 feet off the adjoining subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15670)|
| 4:21:18| So that is another protection offered for adjoining property owners. He has also agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15678)|
| 4:21:30| that he would not do, if apartments ended up being built here, he would not build apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15690)|
| 4:21:36| over two stories on this 12 acres of property. So essentially what he is asking for is planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15696)|
| 4:21:44| residential at eight and a half units per acre with the bulk of the development going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15704)|
| 4:21:53| to the north towards Hardin Valley Road. As you can see, this property would access Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15713)|
| 4:22:04| Valley Road. It would enter at Iron Gate Road where there is a traffic light which makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15724)|
| 4:22:11| it an ideal area for medium density residential and that Hardin Valley Road is already one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15731)|
| 4:22:20| of the better roads in Knox County, Tennessee. And you have a traffic light that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15740)|
| 4:22:26| you entrance onto Hardin Valley Road. So for those reasons, we ask that you all approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15746)|
| 4:22:34| what MPC staff and what the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended. Now I know there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15754)|
| 4:22:42| be opposition. I know they will complain about some work Mr. Garrett did several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15762)|
| 4:22:51| not on this property but on a property to the north that he owns. And he has been, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15771)|
| 4:22:58| has received a notice of violation for some maintenance work he did on that property a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15778)|
| 4:23:05| month or two ago. He has appealed that to Knox County Engineering. No decision has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15785)|
| 4:23:10| been reached on that. He was charged with selling dirt off the property. He has invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15790)|
| 4:23:17| anybody who thinks he was doing that to check with Blunt Excavating which was simply taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15797)|
| 4:23:22| some dirt off the property so he could do maintenance on a permit that he had previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15802)|
| 4:23:28| received from the Knox County Engineering Department to remediate that property. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15808)|
| 4:23:34| correspondence he had with them last week, at the end of last week, they asked him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15814)|
| 4:23:40| do a couple more things to amend his permit and he has agreed to do that. He has also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15820)|
| 4:23:47| been operating under a permit from TDEC on the maintenance work on that remediation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15827)|
| 4:23:54| that continues in full force. In effect, that is a smoke screen. The real issue here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15834)|
| 4:24:04| is planned residential zoning appropriate for this property? And I submit it is after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15844)|
| 4:24:12| being studied by the MPC professional staff and the commissioners, they agree. What is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15852)|
| 4:24:19| the proper density? Mr. Garrett asked for 12. MPC, after studying it, looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15859)|
| 4:24:25| slope analysis, the slope protection plan, said eight and a half units is the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15865)|
| 4:24:32| density for this property. And after seeing what they recommended, he is in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15872)|
| 4:24:37| with that. So that is what we are here before you asking for today. An appropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15877)|
| 4:24:45| with an appropriate density for this property, which is in just behind a commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15885)|
| 4:24:54| along Hardin Valley Road. Thank you. Nick, I need your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15894)|
| 4:25:01| please. Nick McBride, 2032 Fallhaven Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee. Mr. Garrett asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15901)|
| 4:25:31| 12. MPC 37932. Commissioners, we are not here to oppose this rezoning, but we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15931)|
| 4:25:40| don't even know what the project is going to be. We are opposed to the proposed density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15940)|
| 4:25:47| This is a nice piece of property with some natural drainage and slopes to the west. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15947)|
| 4:25:53| are here to discuss some of the issues that we have with the property. The property needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15953)|
| 4:25:58| to be consistent with the properties adjacent to the area. Some of the issues are not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15958)|
| 4:26:06| exacerbate existing traffic problems on Schaefer and Hardin Valley Roads. Traffic this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15966)|
| 4:26:12| was backed up from Hardin Valley Road all the way back to Lovell. And the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15972)|
| 4:26:18| in the afternoons, and it is also on Hardin Valley Road going underneath Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15978)|
| 4:26:29| The second issue is to conserve environmental issues related to this property with natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15989)|
| 4:26:33| drainage and existing slopes and heavily wooded trees. This property needs to be in accord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=15993)|
| 4:26:40| with surrounding properties and adjacent neighborhoods. I have already sent each one of you the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16000)|
| 4:26:48| of this property that is before you this evening, so I will not go over all of that again. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16008)|
| 4:26:55| you can see, this rezoning has been going on for a very long time. I live next to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16015)|
| 4:27:00| property and there are some other neighbors here tonight in opposition as well, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16020)|
| 4:27:05| would stand up. I know the Commission has received quite a few letters over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16025)|
| 4:27:14| 90 days. Most of the letters came in June and we were ready to come in full force because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16034)|
| 4:27:19| the kids were out of school. But unfortunately our subdivision is a lot of young professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16039)|
| 4:27:25| with children and not all the neighbors could come. I believe the West Knox Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16045)|
| 4:27:30| has also sent a letter in opposition to the density which is in front of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16050)|
| 4:27:36| This is a piece of property that touches 14 lots in our subdivision. Mr. Garrett is asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16056)|
| 4:27:41| for 8.5 units per acre, which is almost three times the density as our subdivision. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16061)|
| 4:27:48| like to bring to your attention the current zoning around this property. To the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16068)|
| 4:27:53| is agriculture and OB, technology overlay, which Mr. Garrett rezoned at the 12th hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16073)|
| 4:28:01| in December and January, which will allow him 12 units per acre. We did not oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16081)|
| 4:28:08| It was away from our property and didn't feel that it would be a direct influence on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16088)|
| 4:28:14| property values of our property. You remember back in 2006, MPC staff made a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16094)|
| 4:28:21| for a total of six units per acre. That's 180 units for both tracks. They've just gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16101)|
| 4:28:30| 12 units per acre that we did not oppose to the north on the 20 acres. So that gives them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16110)|
| 4:28:35| 240 units right there. They're actually, if they were to get the 8.5 today, they'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16115)|
| 4:28:41| getting more units per acre than what they asked for six years ago. It seems to me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16121)|
| 4:28:48| if Mr. Garrett is asking too much for his property in order to make something work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16128)|
| 4:28:54| To the west of our subdivision is agriculture technology overlay, and it's also being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16134)|
| 4:29:01| as agriculture. A gentleman, a new property owner at 2100 Schaefer Road, just bought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16141)|
| 4:29:06| track six months ago, put up electric fencing, and has added some beautiful horses to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16146)|
| 4:29:12| property. That's not conducive for an apartment complex, if that is what the plan is. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16152)|
| 4:29:17| last we heard, there's not a buyer for this property. To the south is our subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16157)|
| 4:29:23| which is planned residential technology overlay, which is one to three units per acre, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16163)|
| 4:29:28| the other track to the south, as you can see on the map I handed out, is agriculture with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16168)|
| 4:29:32| technology overlay. The property to the east that abuts this property is agriculture technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16172)|
| 4:29:40| overlay and planned residential of one unit to one and a half units per acre. Just right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16180)|
| 4:29:47| across Thompson Road, as you can see on your map, is planned residential one to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16187)|
| 4:29:52| planned residential one to five, and planned residential one to four. This development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16192)|
| 4:29:58| should be consistent with our neighboring properties. The problem we have is that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16198)|
| 4:30:02| of the property to the west is a natural drainage. It was a natural drainage. We don't know actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16202)|
| 4:30:08| what's down there now with all the grading that's been done when they were trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16208)|
| 4:30:13| shore up the ridgeline. And slopes, therefore, the majority of the density will end up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16213)|
| 4:30:19| the east part of this track, which will be up next to our subdivision. I know Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16219)|
| 4:30:25| Anders has walked the property, and I think a couple other commissioners have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16225)|
| 4:30:30| An apartment complex and or a development with this density will not increase our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16230)|
| 4:30:36| values in our subdivision. As you know, our homes are the largest investment we will make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16236)|
| 4:30:43| An apartment complex will do nothing but bring our property values down. If you have identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16243)|
| 4:30:49| houses in two different subdivisions, one adjacent to an apartment complex or a dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16249)|
| 4:30:58| development and another house next to adjacent residential one to three acres, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16258)|
| 4:31:04| you choose? That is how it will bring down our property values. We have not had good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16264)|
| 4:31:10| dealings with Mr. Garrett in the past. Mr. Garrett did pull, as Mr. Seymour has alluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16270)|
| 4:31:15| did pull some permits to do some grading and site stabilization with seven conditions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16275)|
| 4:31:21| were put down by the TTCDA. Of those, no gradings on slope over 25% grade. No additional steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16281)|
| 4:31:29| slopes shall be affected. Maintaining other areas of mature vegetation and non-disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16289)|
| 4:31:35| as shown on the grading plan. TTCDA, to my knowledge, does not notify adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16295)|
| 4:31:41| owners, and so that's when that got approved. So in May, June, and July of 2012, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16301)|
| 4:31:49| it was, there was a lot of heavy equipment working on the property and cutting mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16309)|
| 4:31:53| vegetation. Then at the end of June or the beginning of July, after a rain, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16313)|
| 4:31:58| mud running down Schaefer Road from this property, and the county investigated, also on Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16318)|
| 4:32:03| Valley. The photos that I've handed in your packet will depict that from the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16323)|
| 4:32:07| investigation. I have reviewed the periodic inspections from the counties, and you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16327)|
| 4:32:12| have a copy of those as well. I want to read one of those. It looks, quote, it looks as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16332)|
| 4:32:17| if Mr. Garrett has ignored the rules and laws for his own personal gain. He has more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16337)|
| 4:32:22| acres available now that he has changed some of the slopes and backfield against what TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16342)|
| 4:32:29| and Knox County told him to do. That was in 2012. Then the property to the north of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16349)|
| 4:32:36| track was rezoned at the beginning of 2014, if I'm not mistaken, which is the OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16356)|
| 4:32:43| And the TTCDA, when they approved it last year, put in one stipulation, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16363)|
| 4:32:48| there was to be no grading until a plan was submitted. Mr. Garrett received another violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16368)|
| 4:32:55| this past June, as Mr. Seymour was talking about, and that was the reason why we deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16375)|
| 4:33:00| from July to this meeting, this rezoning. And the county is still investigating and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16380)|
| 4:33:06| working with Mr. Garrett on that violation. And I've passed that out to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16386)|
| 4:33:12| The density around this property is one to three, one to one and a half, one to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16392)|
| 4:33:18| and one to five units per acre. This is not the place for an apartment complex on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16398)|
| 4:33:24| particular track. I'm concerned if multifamily housing is allowed, it will lower our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16404)|
| 4:33:30| values, deprive existing homeowners of privacy and or security. As I've said earlier, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16410)|
| 4:33:36| are concerned that most of the density will be concentrated towards our subdivision because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16416)|
| 4:33:41| of the drainage and slopes to the west. In closing, we all believe in property owners'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16421)|
| 4:33:47| rights. Mr. Garrett can put twelve units per acre on the track to the north. We did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16427)|
| 4:33:52| oppose that. Now he wants a density of eight and a half units per acre, which will affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16432)|
| 4:33:57| our property values and our subdivision. I want to remind the commission that in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16437)|
| 4:34:02| past May you rezoned a piece of property that's very similar to this for Scott Davis to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16442)|
| 4:34:08| north. It was a ten to twelve acre track. That was PR one to three. Last month you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16448)|
| 4:34:15| rezoned a large track of land, sixty-five acres I believe it is, on Lovell Road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16455)|
| 4:34:23| Snyder with a density of one to 5.6 units per acre. I don't understand why Mr. Garrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16463)|
| 4:34:31| needs eight and a half units per acre. Both of those tracks were not butted up to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16471)|
| 4:34:36| apartment complex. One to eight and a half units per acre is entirely too much. I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16476)|
| 4:34:48| speak with Representative Cain last month on the widening and realignment of the Schaefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16488)|
| 4:34:55| Road property. Unfortunately, as we all know with the federal gas tax collections and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16495)|
| 4:35:03| highway fund, right now those projects, by the last he had heard, are on hold. They do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16503)|
| 4:35:11| in the next several years hope to redo the bridge where Pellissippi Parkway goes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16511)|
| 4:35:18| Hardin Valley and make that three lanes on each side. But right now with federal fundings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16518)|
| 4:35:23| being cut, gas tax revenues being down, that is not on the drawing board. Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16523)|
| 4:35:30| Commissioner Anders, nor is the Schaefer Road. It's been put back. We thought that realignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16530)|
| 4:35:35| was going to happen sooner, but unfortunately it's going to be much later. And not to even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16535)|
| 4:35:41| mention our schools in that area. I know that that's not an issue when it deals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16541)|
| 4:35:47| zonings, but it is an issue that the County Commission is going to have to look at with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16547)|
| 4:35:53| all the new apartments that have been approved. The buses cannot carry the children, the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16553)|
| 4:35:58| are being late to school, kids are late to Pellissippi State, and this density next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16558)|
| 4:36:04| this residential subdivision I do not believe makes sense. And I'll answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16564)|
| 4:36:10| anyone has. Mr. Seymour, he gained you about three and a half minutes there if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16570)|
| 4:36:21| If I may, there are a variety of densities around this property. One that Mr. Garrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16581)|
| 4:36:30| has has 12 units per acre. There are others that are much lower. I would submit that having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16590)|
| 4:36:38| varying densities from 12 down to one and a half really do not affect home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16598)|
| 4:36:45| And I would direct your attention to Sequoia Hills. I've had a project I've been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16605)|
| 4:36:50| down there. Sequoia Hills has something like 600 or 700 apartments either right in the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16610)|
| 4:36:56| of Sequoia Hills or on its periphery. It has big houses on big lots, small houses on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16616)|
| 4:37:04| The density would go all over the map there. Yet Sequoia Hills for some reason has maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16624)|
| 4:37:10| its values over the years since it was built I think starting back in the early part of the 20th century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16630)|
| 4:37:18| So I respectfully submit that apartments, high density residential, medium density as we're asking for here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16638)|
| 4:37:27| really does not affect property values. Mr. Garrett has handed you a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16647)|
| 4:37:33| We have identified four letters or emails from adjacent property owners in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16653)|
| 4:37:44| He also has supplied to you letters of support for what he is doing from four adjoining property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16664)|
| 4:37:53| who have property immediately adjacent to this property and one who is very close by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16673)|
| 4:38:00| So there is a division on that issue. It is not one-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16680)|
| 4:38:08| I would further submit that the entrance to this property would be onto Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16688)|
| 4:38:15| not Pellissippi Parkway, and that is part of what any ultimate developer would have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16695)|
| 4:38:21| on the use on review with the Planning Commission and the Tennessee Tech Carter Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16701)|
| 4:38:28| So those are issues that will be addressed at that time. But right now, Hardin Valley Road is in excellent shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16708)|
| 4:38:37| And we have a stoplight that would give entrance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16717)|
| 4:38:42| So I think eight and a half. If you think that's too high, let's discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16722)|
| 4:38:50| But that's what MPC came up with after doing their slope analysis of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16730)|
| 4:38:57| after looking at development trends in the area, and that's what they've recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16737)|
| 4:39:03| because the highways and roads in this area are in good shape and can support good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16743)|
| 4:39:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16752)|
| 4:39:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16754)|
| 4:39:16| Arthur, let me ask you this. I think it was last year. It may have been longer than that, but I think it was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16756)|
| 4:39:21| I went and enrolled the property and met with Mr. Garrett and looked, and it goes way up the hill and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16761)|
| 4:39:31| Last year, when we looked at some of this, what was the buffer zone and how is that different this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16771)|
| 4:39:36| I mean, did you increase it? It seemed like you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16776)|
| 4:39:38| We did increase the offer on the no-disturb area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16778)|
| 4:39:42| The building setback has always been 100 feet based on the technology cart or overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16782)|
| 4:39:49| but Mr. Garrett said he is willing to pull a no-disturb area up to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16789)|
| 4:39:56| In other words, don't get the bulldozers in there, don't get anything in there that would disturb the vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16796)|
| 4:40:03| which really shields this subdivision from his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16803)|
| 4:40:10| Because what I'm looking at and what I'm thinking about with that, Arthur, is if somebody'sóand I don't know if this is Nick or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16810)|
| 4:40:17| but I don't know exactly which one his house isóbut the people looking out, the stuff's not going to be higher than what they'reó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16817)|
| 4:40:23| It's going to be below them because it slopes back into a valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16823)|
| 4:40:30| I'm not sure you would describe them on a ridge, but their property is higher than the immediately adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16830)|
| 4:40:39| It goes down towards Harbor Valley generally with some ups and downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16839)|
| 4:40:44| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| Nick, let me ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16846)|
| 4:40:48| These picturesóI was out there in April or I think April with Mr. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16848)|
| 4:40:54| and I don't remember seeing all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16854)|
| 4:40:56| Was thatódid I just not get to the right area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16856)|
| 4:40:59| What's the date of that report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16859)|
| 4:41:04| That may have been back in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16864)|
| 4:41:07| I just don't remember seeing areas with a lot of orange and red dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16867)|
| 4:41:11| That's in the county's actual inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16871)|
| 4:41:14| I did not take those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16874)|
| 4:41:16| The county engineering department did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16876)|
| 4:41:19| They may have put grass over it at this point, but that was all the runoff from the grading that he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16879)|
| 4:41:25| I think that was in 2012, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16885)|
| 4:41:27| Okay, that's a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16887)|
| 4:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16888)|
| 4:41:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16889)|
| 4:41:30| What was the MPC's vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16890)|
| 4:41:32| Eight to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16892)|
| 4:41:33| Eight to six for eight and five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16893)|
| 4:41:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16895)|
| 4:41:36| Eight to six for eight and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16896)|
| 4:41:37| It was a split vote, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16897)|
| 4:41:40| Hey, Buzz, if medium residential is 12, what's high density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16900)|
| 4:41:47| Aboveó12 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16907)|
| 4:41:49| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16909)|
| 4:41:50| Medium goes up to 12, but high density is 12 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16910)|
| 4:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16914)|
| 4:41:56| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16916)|
| 4:42:00| Is thereóI'll just give you myósince it's my district and you all are probably looking at me for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16920)|
| 4:42:05| I've explained to Mr. Garrett in TTCDAóI sit on that board also currentlyóand I've explained to him in that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16925)|
| 4:42:15| and I think in the last meeting that we had here about this property that I couldn't support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16935)|
| 4:42:20| If heóI felt like he improved his slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16940)|
| 4:42:24| I think he improvedóI think the county reported that he improved his slope on this last thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16944)|
| 4:42:29| and then this new NOV I can't support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16949)|
| 4:42:33| As a commissioner, I can't support a rezoning in the middle of an NOV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16953)|
| 4:42:39| and so I won't be making a motion in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16959)|
| 4:42:43| So it's up to somebody else to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16963)|
| 4:42:47| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16967)|
| 4:42:49| Could I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16969)|
| 4:42:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16970)|
| 4:42:51| Why are you hesitant to make a motion with the NOV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16971)|
| 4:42:53| I'm justóI want to know your thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16973)|
| 4:42:56| Back at the time that we discussed his first rezoning in TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16976)|
| 4:43:02| he had went in and done some reconfiguring of the dirt and of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16982)|
| 4:43:07| and it made hisóit took some of the slope off and gave him moreó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16987)|
| 4:43:12| according to the county NOV, it gave him more building area and usable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16992)|
| 4:43:18| It was kind ofóand I just told him I couldn't support if he attempted to doó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=16998)|
| 4:43:26| I struggled with the last support that I gave him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17006)|
| 4:43:28| If he attempted to do that again, I couldn't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17008)|
| 4:43:30| And so that's just my way of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17010)|
| 4:43:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17016)|
| 4:43:37| I'll go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17017)|
| 4:43:39| Author, before I do, how long has heóI know he's had this for several years, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17019)|
| 4:43:46| And how many yearsó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17026)|
| 4:43:47| He lives on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17027)|
| 4:43:48| Yeah, I know he lives on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17028)|
| 4:43:52| He bought the first tract out there in 1972,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17032)|
| 4:43:56| and he's added on toóacquired additional tracts since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17036)|
| 4:44:01| And I'm assuming he's using this for retirement and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17041)|
| 4:44:05| I think development has come to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17045)|
| 4:44:08| It has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17048)|
| 4:44:09| Pellissippi Parkway wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17049)|
| 4:44:11| Hardin Valley Road was a narrow country lane when he started out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17051)|
| 4:44:18| You know, we've been working with this gentleman for years, trying to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17058)|
| 4:44:22| I'd like to see us do something if we can help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17062)|
| 4:44:25| And the buffer that you've got, I think you're trying to be a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17065)|
| 4:44:28| when you're doing the buffer that you have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17068)|
| 4:44:30| I'll make a motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17070)|
| 4:44:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17074)|
| 4:44:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17077)|
| 4:44:40| There's no second, but I'm going to let people have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17080)|
| 4:44:43| Okay, I wanted to make youóI wanted to announce that before you address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17083)|
| 4:44:47| Question for Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17087)|
| 4:44:51| In light of what Commissioner Anders brought out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17091)|
| 4:44:55| I know you, in your initial commentsóI don't want to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17095)|
| 4:45:01| but you indicated that they were coming on site to repair something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17101)|
| 4:45:08| or do some modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17108)|
| 4:45:12| Did those modifications, in fact, create a bigger footprint for a flat area, less slope, blah, blah, blah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17112)|
| 4:45:22| Could you explain what those modifications were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17122)|
| 4:45:26| There was some grading out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17126)|
| 4:45:30| Yeah, Mr. Garrett has spent well over $100,000 correcting theó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17130)|
| 4:45:36| And, Nick, if you'd like to respond to it, I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17136)|
| 4:45:39| I'm Phillip Garrett, applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17139)|
| 4:45:41| Put the mic up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17141)|
| 4:45:43| I'm Phillip Garrett, the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| 2012, I received a notice of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17145)|
| 4:45:49| the county wanting me to remediate that whole north side of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17149)|
| 4:45:55| because a previous person that operated there went bust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17155)|
| 4:46:01| and didn't finish the job of making the grades right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17161)|
| 4:46:06| Near the endóthis would have been in August of 2012ó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17166)|
| 4:46:11| there was a place on the top of the hill that my contractor and I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17171)|
| 4:46:17| this may or may not drain correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17177)|
| 4:46:20| To change it so that it absolutely would drain correctly would be a good bit of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17180)|
| 4:46:25| and I was running low onóI was way over budget already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17185)|
| 4:46:29| And we thought, well, there's a decent chance it will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17189)|
| 4:46:32| and what I mean by that is that the water that falls on the top of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17192)|
| 4:46:36| will run into a basin on the top of the hill that I had created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17196)|
| 4:46:40| rather than running over the side down the slopes towards Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17200)|
| 4:46:45| It turned out that in heavy rains, like three, four inches within a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17205)|
| 4:46:50| the water would tend to want to go in various places at different times over the bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17210)|
| 4:46:56| not into the basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17216)|
| 4:46:58| And so I thought that, well, this property can be like this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17218)|
| 4:47:05| That is, before it gets developed and gets graded finally, final grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17225)|
| 4:47:10| And so the opportunity came along to have some dirt removed that I gave to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17230)|
| 4:47:19| They put it across the street for some work they were doing over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17239)|
| 4:47:24| and I didn't charge them for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17244)|
| 4:47:26| I just wanted it gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17246)|
| 4:47:28| And they sloped it so that it went back into the basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17248)|
| 4:47:32| So what it created was more basin, but it didn't create more usable land, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17252)|
| 4:47:44| And it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17264)|
| 4:47:45| I mean, we got enough of it moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17265)|
| 4:47:48| so water's never going to flow over the bluff again from up on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17268)|
| 4:47:53| It goes into this basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17273)|
| 4:47:55| So that was the nature of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17275)|
| 4:48:00| I was also applying at the same time for a permit from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17280)|
| 4:48:07| to possibly in the future make the basin bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17287)|
| 4:48:12| And because I was going to give the dirt away, not sell it, they wouldn't give me that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17292)|
| 4:48:21| And that was the basis of my NOV was I was operating without that new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17301)|
| 4:48:28| The county thought I was selling the dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17308)|
| 4:48:31| and I'll say even if I had gone ahead with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17311)|
| 4:48:37| that would not have increased the footprint because it was just going straight down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17317)|
| 4:48:42| not going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17322)|
| 4:48:48| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17328)|
| 4:48:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the technical purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17329)|
| 4:48:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17332)|
| 4:48:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17333)|
| 4:48:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17334)|
| 4:48:55| I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17335)|
| 4:48:56| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17336)|
| 4:48:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17337)|
| 4:48:58| If you don't mind, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17338)|
| 4:49:00| Commissioner, I think Mr. Garrett was talking about the NOV for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17340)|
| 4:49:04| The NOV from two years ago, I'll read again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17344)|
| 4:49:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17353)|
| 4:49:14| I thought I had the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17354)|
| 4:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17355)|
| 4:49:18| And I think Commissioner Andrews, when he was on the TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17358)|
| 4:49:22| if you look in the notes that I gave you all from several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17362)|
| 4:49:26| Commissioner Andrews made a comment about how Mr. Garrett added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17366)|
| 4:49:30| filled in some drainage areas, changed some slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17370)|
| 4:49:34| And I'll read it to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17374)|
| 4:49:40| It looks as if Mr. Garrett has ignored the rules and laws for his own personal gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17380)|
| 4:49:45| He has more acres available now that he has changed some of the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17385)|
| 4:49:50| and backfilled against what TTCDA and Knox County told him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17390)|
| 4:49:56| That was in 2012, and it was also in the TTCDA minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17396)|
| 4:50:01| I don't know if you all got that huge packet of stuff from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17401)|
| 4:50:05| I don't know how much you all get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17405)|
| 4:50:07| This case has been going on since 2006, as Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17407)|
| 4:50:13| And like I said, they were looking for one to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17413)|
| 4:50:16| Continental Properties was trying to rezone this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17416)|
| 4:50:19| and MPC staff would only allow one to six units per acre at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17419)|
| 4:50:26| and that developer went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17426)|
| 4:50:28| I do want to make a comment about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17428)|
| 4:50:31| Mr. Seymour talked about the property to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17431)|
| 4:50:34| That was just recently rezoned to the OB, to the south of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17434)|
| 4:50:39| But that subdivision or that piece of property does not abut to a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17439)|
| 4:50:45| If you look to the right, there is a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17445)|
| 4:50:48| but it goes all the way down a ravine and then back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17448)|
| 4:50:52| For them to see any development will be almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17452)|
| 4:50:59| Philip Garrett again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17459)|
| 4:51:02| Absolutely, in 2012, when the remediation work was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17462)|
| 4:51:08| there was an increase in usable surface area because of the hill that was exposed we brought down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17468)|
| 4:51:16| That was the only way you could stabilize it, to bring it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17476)|
| 4:51:22| and then create this bowl where the rainwater that fell on the hilltop stayed on the hilltop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17482)|
| 4:51:30| That's not the property we're discussing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17490)|
| 4:51:35| That's on your other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17495)|
| 4:51:39| I think I've got my answer, so, yeah, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17499)|
| 4:51:43| I'll also mention, since Nick talked about density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17503)|
| 4:51:46| that the acreage up front he called 20 acres, it's really 15, and that's the OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17506)|
| 4:51:55| And so the maximum number of units that could be put on that would be 180, not the 240 that he stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17515)|
| 4:52:01| And, in fact, that OB land won't carry 12 anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17521)|
| 4:52:07| So it would be more like 160 or 150 units, not 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17527)|
| 4:52:14| Okay, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17534)|
| 4:52:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17537)|
| 4:52:18| A moment ago when I had my light on, I was doing it for the technical purpose of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17538)|
| 4:52:22| whether or not we had something on the floor to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17542)|
| 4:52:26| We did not have a second at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17546)|
| 4:52:29| We did not, and we still don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17549)|
| 4:52:31| I just allowed discussion because I didn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17551)|
| 4:52:35| I will second the motion just for the purpose of discussion and retain the right to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17555)|
| 4:52:42| The concern that you've brought to us is that the notice of violation should make us feel reticent about passing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17562)|
| 4:52:56| What's the expected time on this repair of the notice of violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17576)|
| 4:53:07| The repair was finished within about a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17587)|
| 4:53:11| When do you go back before engineering, or is there a discussion of an end date to the NOV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17591)|
| 4:53:19| I'm waiting to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17599)|
| 4:53:21| I had a meeting in late July after I got the NOV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17601)|
| 4:53:26| It lasts about an hour talking to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17606)|
| 4:53:28| Then I appealed the NOV and had a hearing on that on August 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17608)|
| 4:53:35| and they said it would be about a week before I'd hear back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17615)|
| 4:53:39| Now it's in a memo I got, an email I got Friday night from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17619)|
| 4:53:47| They said that they'd been busy on other stuff and that they would get to me in due order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17627)|
| 4:53:54| Also, I'll say that they asked me to prepare a maintenance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17634)|
| 4:54:00| There was some, I don't know quite how to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17640)|
| 4:54:07| but my remediation permit with the county expired in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17647)|
| 4:54:16| I called them and said I'd like to renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17656)|
| 4:54:18| They said, well, you don't really need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17658)|
| 4:54:20| Almost nobody ever asked for that because it really just continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17660)|
| 4:54:25| Because I knew I may have to do some more remediation, or I felt I might have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17665)|
| 4:54:30| So in lieu of having, since I got in my appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17670)|
| 4:54:36| they wanted me to prepare a maintenance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17676)|
| 4:54:39| a long-term maintenance plan going forward rather than having this remediation permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17679)|
| 4:54:49| So I've done that, and twice now in the last week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17689)|
| 4:54:53| they've asked me for some details to add a couple of sentences here and there in which I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17693)|
| 4:54:58| So I would assume that real soon I'll have the permanent maintenance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17698)|
| 4:55:04| which I'm basically required to do whether I have a permit or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17704)|
| 4:55:09| because I'm legally responsible for what happens on that site in terms of runoff and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17709)|
| 4:55:16| And the same thing with the state permit that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17716)|
| 4:55:20| They've asked me that as soon as it gets stabilized where I'm satisfied with it, and they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17720)|
| 4:55:25| then to terminate that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17725)|
| 4:55:28| But currently I do have a state permit that's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17728)|
| 4:55:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17734)|
| 4:55:35| I just want to reiterate something to the commissioners here, the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17735)|
| 4:55:39| Commissioner Brown knows how this works, serving on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17739)|
| 4:55:43| But, Mark, you and your staff, you and the professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17743)|
| 4:55:47| get together before MPC and you make a recommendation to the body of everything that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17747)|
| 4:55:54| And our professional staff made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17754)|
| 4:55:58| They said it was fine, and they said it was fine at 8.5 to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17758)|
| 4:56:02| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17762)|
| 4:56:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17764)|
| 4:56:06| You've never disagreed with them, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17766)|
| 4:56:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17768)|
| 4:56:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17772)|
| 4:56:13| We've got a motion and a second to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17773)|
| 4:56:17| At what, 8.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17777)|
| 4:56:19| 8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17779)|
| 4:56:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17781)|
| 4:56:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17782)|
| 4:56:23| Back to my question, when is the notice of violation anticipated to be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17783)|
| 4:56:29| Maybe what's before us is, which comes first, the chicken or the egg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17789)|
| 4:56:34| Is it planned residential and they work toward that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17794)|
| 4:56:37| or is it set in limbo and we have to get a maintenance plan in place before we can then turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17797)|
| 4:56:43| and get a plan in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17803)|
| 4:56:47| So the notice of violation has been fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17807)|
| 4:56:55| We think it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17815)|
| 4:56:58| It's not even on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17818)|
| 4:57:00| It is on an adjoining property that Mr. Garrett has to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17820)|
| 4:57:07| It's on the property that has already been zoned for 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17827)|
| 4:57:13| It does not impact this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17833)|
| 4:57:16| He's required to maintain that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17836)|
| 4:57:23| He didn't explain it very well, and I didn't explain it very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17843)|
| 4:57:26| but the grading that caused all this was done by a developer that had an option on his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17846)|
| 4:57:34| and he went belly up several years ago and didn't finish the work after tearing Mr. Garrett's property up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17854)|
| 4:57:40| He then had to come in and spend at least $100,000 remediating his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17860)|
| 4:57:49| because the fellow did not go through and buy his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17869)|
| 4:57:52| So that's the source of all this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17872)|
| 4:57:56| He's in the remediation business cleaning up the mess somebody else made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17876)|
| 4:58:00| Am I right on that, Mr. Garrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17880)|
| 4:58:06| All he's doing is remediating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17886)|
| 4:58:08| Mr. Seymour, this property was up for rezoning six or eight months ago, and he pulled it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17888)|
| 4:58:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17896)|
| 4:58:17| The vote here was four and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17897)|
| 4:58:20| There were several members of the commission who were not present at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17900)|

| 4:58:30| I think it was the same, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17910)|
| 4:58:33| It was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17913)|
| 4:58:38| Buzz is indicating yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17918)|
| 4:58:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17920)|
| 4:58:41| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17921)|
| 4:58:44| We didn't do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17924)|
| 4:58:46| We didn't do a roll call vote at the beginning of the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17926)|

| 4:59:33| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17973)|
| 4:59:35| I want to pass because I'd like to talk about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17975)|
| 4:59:37| Commissioner Hammond passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17977)|

| 4:59:41| Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17981)|
| 4:59:44| You have four passes to wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17984)|
| 4:59:46| All right, we have four passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17986)|
| 4:59:48| If nobody wishes to vote, we can continue the discussion with Commissioner Hammond, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17988)|
| 4:59:52| or we can, because it'll fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17992)|
| 4:59:55| If everything stays the same, it'll fail and go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=17995)|
| 5:00:00| So do we want to have some more discussion before I announce the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18000)|
| 5:00:04| I'd like to have more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18004)|
| 5:00:07| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18007)|
| 5:00:11| Turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18011)|
| 5:00:13| I didn't say turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18013)|
| 5:00:14| I'm with someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18014)|
| 5:00:16| Well, we've talked about the density at eight and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18016)|
| 5:00:18| I just wanted to ask the question, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18018)|
| 5:00:20| I mean, are you sold on eight and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18020)|
| 5:00:22| Are you willing to come lower, or does it have to be eight and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18022)|
| 5:00:27| It doesn't have to be eight and a half, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18027)|
| 5:00:29| So what can you live with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18029)|
| 5:00:32| We have eight and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18032)|
| 5:00:37| We have, theoretically, 12 units on the other track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18037)|
| 5:00:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18041)|
| 5:00:43| In talking to the modern apartment developers, the ones that do the high end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18043)|
| 5:00:49| they need 225 units per project in order to do the maintenance, keep the maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18049)|
| 5:00:58| and get the economies of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18058)|
| 5:01:01| I was here two months ago with the people on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18061)|
| 5:01:05| They're doing, actually, I think more than that, but they have two other units here, two other complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18065)|
| 5:01:14| So I think it's seven to seven and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18074)|
| 5:01:18| We get with that and what we have on the other track, we get to about 220, 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18078)|
| 5:01:25| So you're saying basically seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18085)|
| 5:01:28| You could live with seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18088)|
| 5:01:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18090)|
| 5:01:33| Did MPC recommend six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18093)|
| 5:01:35| The Commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18095)|
| 5:01:37| The last time the MPC staff recommended eight and a half, MPC recommended eight and a half on the PER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18097)|
| 5:01:46| So I guess, Nick, my question then for you is you indicated earlier that you weren't opposed to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18106)|
| 5:01:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18112)|
| 5:01:53| It's the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18113)|
| 5:01:54| It's the density, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18114)|
| 5:01:57| The development that Arthur is speaking of on Lovell Road is 1 to 5.6 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18117)|
| 5:02:03| There, there are no subdivisions adjoining the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18123)|
| 5:02:08| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18128)|
| 5:02:09| There is a subdivision to the west of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18129)|
| 5:02:12| There is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18132)|
| 5:02:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18133)|
| 5:02:14| Sorry, I was not aware of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18134)|
| 5:02:17| The density around this subdivision is 1 to 1 and a half up to 1 to 5 right there across Thompson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18137)|
| 5:02:25| Yes, Mr. Seymour, the tract that we didn't oppose does allow up to 1 to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18145)|
| 5:02:33| As Mr. Seymour said when they were in front of the Commission, we don't know what that development is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18153)|
| 5:02:38| So, you know, you can't hold us to the 1 to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18158)|
| 5:02:42| You know, we would like to see 1 to 3 that adjoins us, the same development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18162)|
| 5:02:46| and let Mr. Garrett do a transition from this 10-acre tract into his, what he says is a 15-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18166)|
| 5:02:53| He added two additional lots on Schaefer Road, so I thought he had more land than what went over the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18173)|
| 5:02:58| I apologize for having my calculations wrong on the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18178)|
| 5:03:04| 1 to 4, 1 to 4 and a half, I think is reasonable considering it's buttoned up right here next to a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18184)|
| 5:03:11| That's what the zoning is around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18191)|
| 5:03:13| Even a tract of land over off of Hardin Valley to the north on the north side is 1 to 5.4, I believe, or 5.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18193)|
| 5:03:22| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18202)|
| 5:03:23| Arthur, how big is this tract we're talking about, how acreage-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18203)|
| 5:03:29| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18209)|
| 5:03:30| Twelve acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18210)|
| 5:03:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18211)|
| 5:03:34| And again, of this 12 acres, it's kind of like your rezoning you had last month down on Gettysview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18214)|
| 5:03:41| where you had a 2.3-acre density and then I think you went with a 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18221)|
| 5:03:47| This situation here is kind of like that where most of the density is going to be directly behind the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18227)|
| 5:03:53| because the property to the west with the slopes and the drainage, that big pond or whatever it was that Mr. Garrett called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18233)|
| 5:04:00| I'm sorry, I'm not a hydrologist and I don't know the terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18240)|
| 5:04:03| but most of this density is going to be butted up right next to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18243)|
| 5:04:08| This is a difficult one because I understand the homeowners, but I also understand Mr. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18248)|
| 5:04:13| He's on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18253)|
| 5:04:14| He's wanting to retire, and this is his retirement, and so he's on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18254)|
| 5:04:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18258)|
| 5:04:19| It seems to me that the density seems to be the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18259)|
| 5:04:23| You know, you want more, they want less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18263)|
| 5:04:25| We've already come down to 7 and up to 4.5, so maybe that's progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18265)|
| 5:04:30| I don't want to negotiate here in an open meeting, but I'm just saying it seems to be that the density seems to be the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18270)|
| 5:04:36| So I'm looking for the wisdom of the body here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18276)|
| 5:04:41| I mean, I hate to turn him down and say no, particularly when density seems to be the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18281)|
| 5:04:45| and they've agreed that they can go along with it if they could come to an agreement on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18285)|
| 5:04:54| If my math is correct, and don't hold me to this, 12 acres at 4.5 would yield 54 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18294)|
| 5:05:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18302)|
| 5:05:04| Can you do that, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18304)|
| 5:05:09| We should never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18309)|
| 5:05:16| And then 12 acres or 15 acres at 12 would be 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18316)|
| 5:05:21| It's fairly easy math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18321)|
| 5:05:23| So there's 234 on the two tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18323)|
| 5:05:28| That's optimizing that other track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18328)|
| 5:05:30| I don't think they can frankly get 12 units per acre on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18330)|
| 5:05:34| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18334)|
| 5:05:35| I think it's what did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18335)|
| 5:05:41| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18341)|
| 5:05:42| You said seven, yes, and he was saying 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18342)|
| 5:05:44| I'm just trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18344)|
| 5:05:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18345)|
| 5:05:47| Well, let's start at 8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18347)|
| 5:05:49| He started at 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18349)|
| 5:05:51| We'll come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18351)|
| 5:05:52| I started at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18352)|
| 5:05:55| I would just suggest, and my client may kill me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18355)|
| 5:06:00| the sector plan provides for medium density residential, which is 6 to 24 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18360)|
| 5:06:07| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18367)|
| 5:06:08| No, 6 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18368)|
| 5:06:09| 6 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18369)|
| 5:06:10| I mean 6 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18370)|
| 5:06:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18371)|
| 5:06:12| Thank you for correcting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18372)|
| 5:06:17| So let's keep it medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18377)|
| 5:06:19| Let's keep it 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18379)|
| 5:06:23| Would that not be fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18383)|
| 5:06:25| He's getting 100 feet right there at the outset that we can't put any building next to their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18385)|
| 5:06:36| What was your no disturb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18396)|
| 5:06:39| 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18399)|
| 5:06:40| 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18400)|
| 5:06:43| Got pretty good setbacks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18403)|
| 5:06:46| Commissioner, you're on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18406)|
| 5:06:48| Was he saying me first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18408)|
| 5:06:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18409)|
| 5:06:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18410)|
| 5:06:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18411)|
| 5:06:53| Is it proper to do a substitute motion since we haven't called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18413)|
| 5:06:59| Yeah, there's no announced vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18419)|
| 5:07:00| I think you could do a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18420)|
| 5:07:05| I'm going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18425)|
| 5:07:06| A substitute motion at 6.5, and I think that is kind of splitting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18426)|
| 5:07:15| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18435)|
| 5:07:17| And retaining the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18437)|
| 5:07:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18439)|
| 5:07:20| Retaining the setback and the 40 foot stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18440)|
| 5:07:26| MPC tried to do some of those, and they said you can't do conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18446)|
| 5:07:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18450)|
| 5:07:32| Well, he's in the technology corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18452)|
| 5:07:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18457)|
| 5:07:42| Just to reiterate another point that I thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18462)|
| 5:07:44| You were talking about the density, and we're looking at 8.5 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18464)|
| 5:07:48| It's right by the interstate, and you find higher density closer to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18468)|
| 5:07:53| versus way up in a subdivision area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18473)|
| 5:07:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18479)|
| 5:08:00| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18480)|
| 5:08:01| Did you have a question, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18481)|
| 5:08:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18484)|
| 5:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18485)|
| 5:08:07| We have a substitute motion of 6.5 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18487)|
| 5:08:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18490)|
| 5:08:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18491)|
| 5:08:13| 6.5 foot-and-a-half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18493)|
| 5:08:16| And maintaining the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18496)|
| 5:08:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=18498)|
