| 2:48:08| to high density on the 19 acres and request that they look at rezoning the 51 1⁄2 acres to 4 1⁄2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10088)|
| 2:48:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| I'm looking at the law director for, I mean, is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| We can initiate sector plans and zoning changes here at the commission level, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| I will accept that as my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| If the second agrees, Commissioner Jay agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10121)|
| 2:48:45| Or you can make a substitute motion, however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| I make a substitute motion that we send back to MPC to look at the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| to change the 19 acres from low density residential to high density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| and to also look at the zoning on the rest of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| the 51 1⁄2 acres at 4 1⁄2 units per acre PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| We have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| The motion for the substitute motion was made by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| It was seconded by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| I will restate this motion, and then I'm going to ask for Commissioner Gill to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| I just want to say it one more time so we all know exactly what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| The motion before us, please step in, Daniel, if I restate this incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10172)|
| 2:49:38| but with these zonings it's important to make sure everybody knows exactly what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| The motion is to send back a sector plan amendment request to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10182)|
| 2:49:51| to change it from its current zoning, which I think is up to five, to 14 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10191)|
| 2:50:01| LDR to high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| LDR to high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| That's the first part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| The second part of the motion is to request a zoning change on the back 51 acres to 4.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10208)|
| 2:50:18| which would be a reduction from the current five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| It's 51 and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| Based on what I said, to restate your motion, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10232)|
| 2:50:33| Now we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10237)|
| 2:50:38| I'd like to hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10238)|
| 2:50:46| The most important component of this substitute motion, with all due respect to Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10246)|
| 2:50:53| is that you are asking for this area to turn into a high density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10253)|
| 2:51:01| That does not comport with the 2016 Southwest Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10261)|
| 2:51:08| which calls for low density residential at one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10268)|
| 2:51:13| So we're back to the original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| You really should be looking at this appeal, denying the appeal, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| go back to where you started and do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| What you're asking for and what is before us right now is you're going from low density to high density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10294)|
| 2:51:43| only on the property where the apartments are now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Then what is the rest of the property, which is the 51 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| We're going to go from five units to 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| But you have to have a sector plan to do that just for the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| That way you can get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| So that's what we're voting on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10328)|
| 2:52:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10334)|
| 2:52:15| And Commissioner Bix, is there any way we can get a map pulled up so we can look at it a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| and everybody just kind of get on the same base while we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| Is there any way to do that on the screen so Mr. Smith can point it out for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10341)|
| 2:52:27| Do we have a laser pointer or anything so we can do this together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| Put it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10350)|
| 2:52:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| On the agenda document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| Yes, on your agenda document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| On the agenda document that's attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10356)|
| 2:52:41| I've got this right here so everybody can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10361)|
| 2:52:54| I'm not sure that that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| Who's got control of that computer starship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| Is that you, Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10378)|

| 2:53:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| I restated the motion that was before us so everybody should be in understanding of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10405)|

| 2:55:12| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10512)|

| 2:55:20| from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10520)|

| 2:55:36| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| What I was bringing up here is when we do plot plans and we try to do hill slope protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10538)|
| 2:55:45| there's a couple of subdivisions that have been new ones that are just going to be coming online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| that they're doing the gratings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| And in one that was rolling hills, there was no really steep inclines in this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10552)|
| 2:55:59| However, on one side of the property, the incline that went up on one side was over a 30-degree angle up the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10559)|
| 2:56:10| Now, what you do when you disturb already really solid land and you pull it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| you make that slope in the future not steady ground because it can be, it will soak up some water or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10576)|
| 2:56:29| and it will freeze in the contract and then that piece of land will start to slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10589)|
| 2:56:36| because of that high angle of that slope that was created by trying to make as much level land as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10596)|
| 2:56:45| It also makes it hard for the water to soak in the ground and run off because you get down into levels of sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10605)|
| 2:56:55| that will not accept water, so it makes it a faster runoff of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| So we're creating a problem of runoff of water and a slope issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10620)|
| 2:57:07| and I've seen it on two other developments that are like eight to nine years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| where that bank that was created is now sliding down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| And then when you go to the owners of that property that have bought houses or condos on that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10637)|
| 2:57:23| the only thing that you can tell them is we approve the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| However, if they're going to have any restitution to save their property or their backyard from sliding off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10647)|
| 2:57:35| you have to do a civil suit in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| Now, why do we, when we do a plot plan, make a 30 degree bank when there was none there before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10659)|
| 2:57:48| and it becomes unstable property years down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10668)|
| 2:57:55| And is there anything that we can do or are engineers not looking for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| when that piece of property causes a problem for the individual that owns that house that they bought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10681)|
| 2:58:10| As Mr. Sanders said, the Hillside Ridgetop Protection Plan is a policy document, not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10690)|
| 2:58:18| It's just a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| We have no standards for land disturbance, no standards for preserving slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10701)|
| 2:58:28| So the only way to do anything would be to place in the code limits on grading of steeper properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10708)|
| 2:58:34| put in the code limits on density on steeper properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| What I'm saying is this property is not that steep right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| and they cut it off and move property out on this one piece and that bank is about 30 feet high now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10722)|
| 2:58:49| where before you could never notice it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| We're creating a hill slope problem by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| So how can we say we have hill slope protection when in our plot plans we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10738)|
| 2:59:06| and create a problem for that individual that's buying that home down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| We do not have hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| We do not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| We have a policy document that was adopted as a policy document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| Staff tries to use it to guide development, but we have no code to require a certain grade of slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10758)|
| 2:59:27| unless it's accepted what exists in the engineering standards and erosion control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10767)|
| 2:59:34| If that slope is perceived to be stable, there's no limit on the grade of that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10774)|
| 2:59:42| So even though you create an unstable piece of property down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| there's no, by your engineering standards or what you're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10786)|
| 2:59:51| there is a problem that occurs eight, nine, ten years down the road on some of these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10791)|
| 2:59:58| Isn't there any way we could do anything to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| create a policy that keeps them from developing that kind of problem for an individual down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10801)|
| 3:00:09| The commission could establish standards that limit grading, that limit the height of slopes, the percent of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10809)|
| 3:00:17| There are a number of issues you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| The question is would you be willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| Can we develop policies that would protect the property while allowing reasonable development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10823)|
| 3:00:29| Okay, let's don't debate this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| Can we set up a time in the near future we could sit down and discuss these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10832)|
| 3:00:38| and these issues and set these standards to protect the people not just presently but down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| In preparation for that, MPC staff can do some research on what other communities can do to protect slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10846)|
| 3:00:52| and the standards they have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10855)|
| 3:01:01| Okay, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| If you do that, I'm sure Mr. Snowden would like to say anything on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| Because a lot of those would be actually in the grading and erosion control standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10867)|
| 3:01:13| We can set the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| If you all come back that it can't be no more than 23 or 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| it could be a code change and engineering would enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| And in most cases that would be solved with the retaining walls, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10889)|
| 3:01:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| Another way, there are all types of standards, and I've seen them, limits on heights of retaining walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| limits on height of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| It depends on what your goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10914)|
| 3:01:56| It's just to stabilize or to protect the existing terrain, so there are lots of different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10916)|
| 3:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10925)|
| 3:02:06| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10929)|
| 3:02:10| I'd like to entertain a motion for dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10930)|
| 3:02:13| Moved by Commissioner Gill, seconded by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10937)|
| 3:02:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10940)|
| 3:02:21| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10941)|
| 3:02:22| We're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10942)|
