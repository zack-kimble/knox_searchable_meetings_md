| 0:02:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=157)|

| 0:02:41| Any items to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=161)|

| 0:02:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| I got a phone call and spoke with the applicant for items 12D as in Delta and E as in Echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| She requested a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| This is out there at the edge of the city-county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| 12D and E to postpone to two weeks, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| Postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| If you'd raise your hand, we'll denote from the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Mr. Haslam, I would like to request postponement of two weeks, well, actually two weeks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| two items and four weeks for another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Item 9A, the knowledgee ordinance, I would request that that be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=214)|
| 0:03:43| And 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Why don't we do those separately just because 9A is the item dealing with the knowledgee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| contract and it's been moved to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| We have a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I'll give you a little background before we do it once there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Deb, do you want to explain, or Ms. Poplin, do you want to explain where we are on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| This afternoon we received from the State a draft copy of the State Cable Franchise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| Bill that's been going through the legislature being negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| It is 68 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| And we didn't get it until late this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| And just on my cursory review, this could have impacts on the existing franchise and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| So we want time to assess this before this goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| If you all had questions about, well, how does the AT&T ruling impact this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| We didn't feel qualified to answer you after having it for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| So we have spoken with knowledgee and told them that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Knowledgee is fine with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Knowledgee is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| They, quite frankly, have the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Now that this is up, it kind of changes their game, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| So they would have asked for it if we hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| Other on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| All those in favor of postponing for two weeks, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Now, Ms. Peel, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Mayor Haslam, 9B, which is the B drive closure, had once again been asked for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| And I think at the end of that two weeks, this hopefully will be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| 9B for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| We have a motion for 12A, and that is the dynamic display or digital billboard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| And we are having a workshop May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| So postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Is that the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Four weeks would be the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| That would take us to like May 6th or something like that, I think, close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| But move to postpone 12A for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=349)|

| 0:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Actually, 12A was what I was going to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=357)|

| 0:05:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| I would like to request to withdraw 12H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| The Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association was raising money for fifth-graders to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| a trip, and they raised the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Somebody wanted money and hasn't done one anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I've never heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| So I appreciate them contacting me, and also thank you for the council members who supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=384)|

| 0:12:58| As the folks on council and the community are certainly well aware of the issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Baptist Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital, I've spoken with Jerry Askew, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| going to be some public forums coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| One's going to be in South Knoxville at some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| He called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| He said they're still working on a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And there's going to be one in close in North Knoxville, you know, because those are obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| you know, big facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| They each have their own big problems, and that's not including the rather large financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| issue that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| But, you know, give citizens the opportunity to ask some questions and find out more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| And I'm hoping that soon we'll be able to announce some dates and locations for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Mr. Frost, the one in South Knoxville, and I appreciate you bringing that up because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| I believe it's been finalized now, according to Craig Griffith, and it's the 21st, Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| the 21st, 630 at South Doyle Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| That will be confirmed, but when he called me yesterday, it sounded like it was definite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I wanted to go ahead and hand out to folks a copy of a draft, it's actually a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| This is something I know folks have heard a lot about over time with Fountain City Connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| work on a new sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| It's a resolution MPC because most of what needs to be done needs to go into end MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| I'm going to be putting this on the agenda for the meeting in two weeks because I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| to get it on the public record someplace that it's official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| I know we're talking about a workshop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I don't know if we've got a confirmed date on that, but the hope I was having tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| is I could say we could do a workshop on this because I think it is an important issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| with a lot of sides to it that I know this council want to dive into, but I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| get this in everybody's hands in sort of an official form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| If anybody wants to co-sponsor this with me or has comments, you can holler at me or Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| My only comment is just to kind of respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| I think that from what I have heard a great deal from people about this and the feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| that there is tremendous need for a workshop and I think some consideration of including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| that in our, what am I trying to say, accessory wouldn't come to me, accessory buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=923)|
| 0:15:33| workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Which is the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Which is the 12th of June, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| So anyway, I just wanted, I think many people feel there's going to be a workshop in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| and I didn't want anyone to think that we were going to go ahead and jump the gun and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| make some decisions on this prior to the public having some opportunity to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| Have we set that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I know we've received emails about doing it on the 12th or the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Is it set, Cindy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I don't think it's set, but the power of suggestion is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Anything else, Ms. Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=963)|

| 0:16:05| We're ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| 8A is a resolution appointing Louis S. Pipkin and reappointing Jane Allen and Curtis Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=966)|

| 0:16:17| Well, I just wanted to just make a real comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Anytime I see this person's name, I think it's appropriate to recognize them and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| in light of all the service she has done in this community in her age, we appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| work and the commitment from Ms. Sarah Moore Green, who has served on this board in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Ms. Green is up in age now, still very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| I see her at church quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| We go to the same church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| I just wanted to tell her, as she is exiting off the board, that we do appreciate her past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| service and all that she has done for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| We did thank her, and it was heard that she was ready to resign from the board, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1017)|

| 0:17:59| the appeal by Karen O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| There are several folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Would you like to hear from the audience first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Well, I mean, I'd actually, at some point, I'm going to be making a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| because I get the feeling that there's room to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| And I want to know if we should have that discussion first, and you and I have not talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| on this, Mr. Vice Mayor, but I'd sort of like to say, is this something we need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| or is this something we can put off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| You know, I think the applicant and the attorney for the developer could better answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| However, I do understand we had a meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| My understanding is from talking to Ms. O'Dell today and also to Steve Moore, who is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| attorney for the developers, that they made some, really they tried to make some Herculean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| efforts to try and find some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| And there's just one issue in particular that is just a real sticking issue that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| can't resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I have no problem with another postponement, but I would rather hear from Mr. Seymour and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Ms. O'Dell if they think that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I do know there was another meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I think there have been maybe at least three that I've been involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| And I know Mr. Seymour and Ms. O'Dell and even myself today had differing discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| about can we find, you know, some common ground and close this gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| I suspect that that may not be the case in answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| May I suggest that Ms. O'Dell and Mr. Seymour, if you want to make a brief comment just on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| whether we're close enough to an agreement to go on or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| This is not arguing for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| We're just talking about is there an agreement possible at this point and very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| And Ms. O'Dell, I'm not sure where you are, but if you'd like to speak to that too, either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| way is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| She and I had a phone conversation about two hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| And we both agreed on one thing, that we were at an impasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1205)|

| 0:20:29| I have eight or nine signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Mr. Seymour, I'll let you organize that effort if you would like to, however you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Remember, you have three...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Each side can have three people speak for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Then those in favor have a two-minute rejoinder if they would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| And then the council will have their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1251)|

| 0:21:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| My name is Karen O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| My address is 333 Macedonia Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| I file the appeal for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Some of the residents attended a town hall East meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| Realtor Sharon Davis presented the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Our first question was, what would happen to Eastburn Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Mark Donaldson was at that meeting, and we asked if the two accesses, the two roads were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| a request or a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| He said they were a request, not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| No five-story condos were mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| And when we saw the drawings of the duplexes and the fourplexes, again, there were no five-story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Our next meeting was with the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| When Ms. Davis was asked about all of the concentrated parking, she didn't know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| said we would have to talk to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| So we met with the developers again, and again, it was a presentation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| But after that meeting, we asked again about the parking, and they said at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| Mr. Everett said it was for five-story condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And this was the second meeting, and the neighbors were not advised of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| And we were shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| A couple of days before the next meeting, Mr. Seymour stated, when he came to MPC, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| stated that there had been numerous neighborhood meetings and that the neighbors and that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| was a project that the community wanted and needed and would help the area in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| And that is in the MPC's own minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| And there had been two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| They were, neither of them were discussion meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| And the MPC passed the project because they believed there was no neighborhood opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| The neighborhood still was trying to piece together the scope of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| We filed the appeal saying we don't want a project of this size in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| especially with five-story condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| An estimated 1,723 average daily vehicle trips on our roads per MPC's use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| report and the project, the projection that the project would take 15 feet off of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| mountain behind their homes and the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| The neighbors had several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Again, after the appeal, the residents received few answers to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| On April 1st, Mr. Seymour asked for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| The afternoon of the city council meeting, so we could work out the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| Again, we tried to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| They made us a presentation, but we still had many unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| We kept offering suggestions like, would you please put in a boulevard at the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| That way that would have your two entrances and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Just don't open it out on Eastburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| We could be able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Changing the condo heights, they couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Finally, Mr. Brown said, could you just take any of these things back and ask them to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Because we kept suggesting compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Everything we suggested met with, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| We got to ask somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| We don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| So in desperation, Mr. Brown said, could you just run any of this bomb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| And Mr. Seymour said, yes, he would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Another meeting with Mr. Seymour and the developers, again, this was their compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| They would put two sets of speed bumps on either side of the proposed gate that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| That was in the minutes for the 14th to 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| And they would put two sets of speed bumps and take the condos down one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| And with that, we couldn't do that because Eastburn is the deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| It's the only thing that protects our neighborhood from whatever happens to their, if, I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| their project goes, but if it doesn't, it's still in our neighborhood forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| And Mr. Seymour called me and said, how about if we close Eastburn and bring everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| down to two stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| The neighbors were delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| That sounded like a perfect plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| But we talked again this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| He said that, you know, the people he talked to would not go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| So they were back to opening Eastburn and having four three-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| The neighbors said that's not negotiable because the only thing that separates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| neighborhood from whatever happens there is the closure of Eastburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| In 2002, the church proposed 100 units of government-funded apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| One of the staff recommendations for that project was a physical barrier to consist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| of a combination of fencing and landscaping be installed at the existing dead end of Eastburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| Drive prior to commencing construction of the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| And that's straight out of the minutes of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| This was in direct response to MPC's own zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| Also in their comments, they said that after visiting the site, staff determined that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| to the property should not be directed onto our streets because we're an old neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| We have small streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| And this amount of traffic, MPC said 1,700, over 1,700 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1580)|
| 0:26:28| And Metropolitan Planning Commission zoning says that they can't make it hazardous to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| That's hazardous to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| And we have a post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| We have two doctor's offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| We have numerous businesses within two blocks of where this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| So, you know, we're just asking, make it so we can live with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| We're not trying to restrict them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| The five-story condos are in no way compatible with their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| They're not compatible with anybody's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Mr. Seymour keeps telling us that we can measure how far away these condos are in football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| When they take that mountain down and they take those trees down, we can measure how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| far away those condos are in miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Fifteen more seconds, Ms. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| And we ask that you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| We have 250 petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| The city council has copies of these signed by neighbors, 200 of which live in walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| distance of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| And all we're saying is that, according to their own directory, they have 25 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| of their families live within the 37914 area code, which takes in 39 miles, with only 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| families in the two, within two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| So there's a lot of people here, but they're not in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| And in closing, I'd like to say, Mr. Seymour said the real tragedy would be if the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| and the church lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Actually, the real tragedy will be if you let them open Eastburn Drive and put up five-story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| condos in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| The church has proposed two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Ms. O'Dell, you will have a chance to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Ms. Chalkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| You say there are just two speaking in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules and allow her to have seven and a half minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| or whatever the half of that is, and the other person has seven and a half or ten and five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| whichever way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| You'd like them to have a total of 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| A total of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| All those in favor of that, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| You have another however many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| You'll have a total of 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| They offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| They're saying that they're going to have a gate on Eastburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| They're going to offer a gate on Eastburn, but the fact is, if this project doesn't go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| and there's a lot of condo projects in Knoxville that aren't going right now, the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| it's sold, those people can do whatever they want to with that gate and open them right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| into our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And all we're saying is that they've proposed two things for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| One was government-funded apartments, and the other are five-story condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| We're not bad neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| We're not against everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| We're saying, please bring something reasonable into our neighborhood that we can live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| and they can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| And all we're saying is, the real tragedy is if you let Eastburn Drive open, you put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| the five-story condos in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| We're asking you to please vote no to this project and to uphold our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Judge Belsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Judge Belsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Judge Belsman, you'll have a total of seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Mr. Mayor and ladies and gentlemen of the City Council, it's a great honor to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1785)|
| 0:30:03| before you and to tell you about the story of the property which is involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Because I think you have to know the property, and I hope you have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| And I think that you need to know the neighborhood, and we're not here in opposition to the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| as a church, as a place of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| We only want to inform you that if you vote no, you're not voting against God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| You're voting in favor of whatever the issue is that's before us, but some have been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| that if you're against it, you're against God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| If you vote for this, you're voting for the one form of a gated community that does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| exist in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| It doesn't exist in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| It doesn't exist in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| It is a gated community within a residential section, and that gated community has many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| things that have to be solved about it, and it's a very complicated development because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| it is run and operated by the people who are within it, and that scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| I am here representing the folks because they asked me to, but I'm here representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| me also because I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I know what a gated community is, and to have 194 units built in any kind of a style in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| a gated community in your neighborhood, there are no others in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| Therefore, I'm asking you, after you already have known what she has told you about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| Metropolitan Planning Commission, this started with the appointment of a committee for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| church to determine what its development was, so in 2002, the Metropolitan Commission voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| In 2005, there wasn't much opposition to it then because they were putting in a senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| citizens group next to it, but they were not going on Eastman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| The Metropolitan Planning Commission had held in each of these two instances, you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| go on Eastman Road because the traffic through there is a thing that cannot be met, and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| one has really decided to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| They say now, because of the new rule we made about so many units you could have per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1967)|
| 0:32:57| and that's the late issue, as you know, and it's therefore a business proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| It's a business proposition with a developer and the church to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| For money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| The folks that live where I live are there because they're there as residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| They're not there to make money off of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| They're there to live and raise children and go to church, and so I came as an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| as well as representing these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I'm sure that you have seen me in this issue before, but I'm unalterably opposed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| form of government within a gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| I'm opposed to the five-story buildings that are being built in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| I think 194 units is absolutely ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| One last thing, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| There is no waste water provision except three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| Where the ballpark is for the church, they're saving it for overflow of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| When you build all these buildings, you have water and you don't have land to absorb it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| On another section of it, they're having two more pools, and they say these water pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| will take care of the water problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| You know what happens to water pools where you have gasoline and oil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2072)|
| 0:34:42| I think it's a horrible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Mr. Seymour, I'll let you coordinate the speakers for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I will start off, and Pastor Chris will wrap up, and then we have Mr. Pope and Ms. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| who are going to fight for the second spot, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| I am here on behalf of Chill Highway Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| And behind me are many people here who are in support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| They are citizens of Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| They are citizens of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Many are members of Chill Highway Hills Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| They have come tonight to express their support for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| and I would like to ask them to stand up, those who are in support here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| Mr. Seymour, Mr. Seymour, could you ask them to remain standing for just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| If I may finish my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Could you ask them to remain standing for just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I have a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Now, could all of those of you who do not live within a half-mile radius of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| please sit down and the rest remain standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| Those of you who do not live within a quarter-mile radius of the site, please sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Those of you who are residents of the city of Knoxville and Knox County, please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| And also who go to church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I am here, as I mentioned, on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| The proposal, which I think many of you are familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| involves 194 condominium units on 43 acres in the city of Knoxville in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| The property is zoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| The East Sector Plan and the One-Year Plan provide for medium-density residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| The applicant proposes low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| A condominium for people 50, age 50 and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| It is on property now owned by Chill Highway Hills Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| The church, as you will know, is in front of the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| There are apartments immediately to the east of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| They are in excess of 100 apartments there that front on or have access to Carter Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| the road Judge Bozeman lives on, which, by the way, will not be used for access to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| Trinity Hills, one of the finest assisted living centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| if not the finest in this city, is located on the campus also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| This matter came before the Metropolitan Planning Commission in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| MPC staff recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| There was plenty of discussion at the MPC meeting about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| People spoke in favor and against it, as the minutes reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| After discussion, the Metropolitan Planning Commission unanimously recommended approval of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| and added two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| The matter is here on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| The opponents state three reasons that they are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| One, height of three buildings, which are five stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Access to Eastman Road and buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| We have tried unsuccessfully to resolve these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Let me tell you, though, that the three five-story buildings we offered to reduce to three stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| if we could add one more building so we would have four three-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| The closest of these buildings would be 560 feet away from the nearest home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| On Eastman Drive, which, by the way, is a public street, not a private road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| we propose a secondary outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| We have offered and we propose and will do the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| We will gate it so only residents can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| They will need a key card or a keypad to get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| We will put two speed bumps on the development side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| This should force traffic to use the main entrance to the project, which is Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| On the issue of buffering, we will comply with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| We have a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| They, after negotiation, have approved our landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| We ask you to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| This is the largest new housing development that has been proposed for East Knoxville in many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2374)|
| 0:39:43| It is a private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| It asks for no public subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| It asks only for permission to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| This is the shot in the arm that East Knoxville needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| The property is in the central city, or I say anything that's in the central city is inside the 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| And if you draw 640 on around, this would be inside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| You all passed a resolution in 2002 at the request of several members of the present council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| deploring urban sprawl, urging that development continue in the central city rather than spreading to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2415)|
| 0:40:26| This is a perfect example of the type of development this resolution spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| It was resolution number R-539-02 because it said that urban sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2432)|
| 0:40:40| undercuts simultaneous efforts to reinvigorate downtown areas and our inner cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| That is what the applicant here is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| We ask you to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| It's East Knoxville's time, and we ask you to give the go-ahead in green light to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| This group has a total of nine minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| Council, my name is Keith Pope, and I'm one of the developers in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| I've graduated from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| I've practiced law in Knoxville for 17 years, and I've invested and developed real estate in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| I've extensively invested in the properties in East Knoxville in the Burlington area doing rehabilitation of existing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| I recently built several homes in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| I've been involved as a developer in six condominium projects in Melbourne and Clearwater, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| primarily for, we call them snowbirds, of over 500 units, people over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| I've had the privilege to be appointed to the Knox County Commission or by the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| as a judicial commissioner for three terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| As a Knox County judicial commissioner just over here in the city county building, I've signed a lot of warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| Most of those warrants I've signed in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| We're trying to improve East Knoxville with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| I have a real estate partner here, Ross Everett, who grew up in Knoxville and went to Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| and he's returned to Knoxville to develop adult active communities with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| We formed a partnership with Chilhowee Hills Baptist Church to build this adult active community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| in East Knoxville on this proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| We diligently worked with MPC and their stormwater engineers and anyone else that we worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| to develop a plan that MPC unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| Vice Mayor Brown worked extensively with us also and the community to try to come to some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| Because we've met and exceeded the requirements as required by the regulations of MPC and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| we have a project that's been unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| Is this a positive project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Is this going to have a positive impact to this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| We will be providing homes for people 50 and over who will be property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| and taxpayers in our city for homes of over $200,000 in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| These owners will provide local businesses patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| They won't be a source of crime, but a source of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| And this growth we are proposing is without any request for special financing or tax breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| We will be paying our own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| We have met with the local community on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| Four times in the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| We've offered compromises with none in return other than deal killers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| something that prevents us from building the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| We have worked and retained engineers and have traffic engineers here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| that have come up with plans to discourage traffic from using the Eastburn Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| to try to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| So that the community members have to use a car to get in and out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| The gate for the Asheville Highway exit would always be open during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| so they would be encouraged to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Also, the speed bumps that have already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I believe council needs to understand that Eastburn is an open thoroughfare now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| It's got a gate that closes it because the pastor closed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Because they had criminal activity that was going on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| Prostitutes would bring their clients up there and they would park in the grassy area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| and then the church would be left with what they left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| From condoms or drug paraphernalia or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| The church has 484 members in this zip code that are for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| I've been asked to let Pastor Chris have a few minutes also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Pastor Chris, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| I'm trying to keep everything fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| You all have a total of five minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| My name is Tony Crisp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| I live at 411 Carter Road on the hill just behind the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great project for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Joey Hills has been a beacon of light in a depressed economic area of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| We have cleaned up the Family Inns Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| We have partnered with the number one public school assembly program in the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| and brought them home here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| We have taken a crime-ridden, crack-infested motel and we've made it a showcase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| Not only do we care about the children of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| but we've also done everything we can to reach out to those who are seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| and that is a heavily populated senior area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| We have built a state-of-the-art, unapologetically state-of-the-art facility there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| that by all standards has made a positive difference in the community of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| In other words, we have a track record behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| We have had no failures, only successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| We've added millions of dollars into the local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| This is a $40 million or $50 million project that will bring over a period of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| millions of dollars into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I believe and I believe the people of Knoxville are watching to see if this city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission, which has already approved this unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| are really serious about doing anything about East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| We've heard a lot about it, but we have rolled up our sleeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| We've not asked the city for one thing except permission to do what we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| that we could all do together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Eastburn Road is a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| I closed that gate for the reasons that have been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| not because we were bound by law to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| but because it was the best thing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Now we are in a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| We want to bring positive change to East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| and all we're asking from the city council is not to fight us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| but to approve what you have already in your Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| have approved unanimously to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Knoxville is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| The citizens of Knoxville are watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| This is a blighted area, and we're making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| And we are praying to God that you, as a city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| will stand with us as we seek to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| We are displacing no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| We are adding only value to that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| and we're doing it in the right way, in a positive way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| and we hope that you'll stand with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2895)|
| 0:48:30| Ms. O'Dell, you have two minutes to respond if you would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| and then we will move to council discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| and I'm sure council reserves the right to ask questions of both sides at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| I would just like to say that we asked the church to do a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| so that we wouldn't have to talk about Eastburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| They would lose 25 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| So because there's a lot of them and they think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| they can just show up and that happens, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| the fact is we would have agreed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| And we did accept Mr. Seymour's idea of four three-story condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| We were delighted with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| But the deal breaker was Eastburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| And as we are not inner city and we are not downtown Knoxville as we were referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2954)|
| 0:49:22| and I resent that Mr. Pope makes it sound like that we're a crime-ridden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| because we are not, and we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Let's try to be both sides if we can be respectful and it will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| We are going to sell these condos to 50-plus people, 50-year-old-plus people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| for $200,000 in the back of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And I hope that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| But if it doesn't, then there is no control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| And they can say that they're going to, they can say that the keypad or the gate or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| but if it's sold, if this doesn't go and it's sold, the new owner can do whatever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| And Mr. Billingsley is back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| If anybody would like to ask him any questions, he lives at the corner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| And maybe he could help you with some of the criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| And the reason that that gate was closed, that is not a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| It has never, ever, no matter what anybody says, I've lived there for the last 57 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| It's never, ever been a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| If it was a street, it would run through the apartments over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| So it's not a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| It's always been a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| They're just trying to pull the wool over your eyes like they do everybody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| And that's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Ten more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Members of Council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Mr. Frost, I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Mr. Seymour, you heard Mrs. O'Dell refer to the opening of Eastburn as the sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I was not aware that she was in agreement with me on the four, three-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| We talked about it, but that may be the sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Now, that's the only question I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Mr. Donaldson, Mr. King, is there, you know, we've heard some debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| and we've heard some negotiations going on back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Is it going to be a requirement, whether it's MPC or city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| to have that access out to Eastburn to do this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| There actually is, in the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| language that would support the connection to Eastburn at 62-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| which generally relates to adjoining road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| There's the language that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| The proposed road system of a subdivision shall generally provide for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| continuance of existing or dedicated streets in adjoining or nearby tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| In addition, dedication of rights-of-way shall be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| for the connection of the subdivision to any adjoining unsubdivided land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| to accommodate an increase in traffic resulting from the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| So there is general language to support this notion of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| There is also good general planning principles that the more connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| we make our subdivisions, the safer they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| and the greater the chance for reducing traffic congestion on arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| But it's not a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| I would read this as a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Shall generally provide for the continuance of existing streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Mr. King, do you have any thoughts as to what engineering might require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| in terms of traffic engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| I think typically engineering relies upon MPC's judgment for street connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| One additional thing that I might mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| oftentimes there are requirements from the Fire Marshal's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| about fire access and additional points of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| And I did touch base with Roger Bird, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| You may want to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| But he did tell me that they did not have a specific requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| for additional access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| That's all I have for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Mr. Roddy, I'll just stay this side, and then I'll go over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Vice Mayor Brown, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| But I was going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Councilman Frost, that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| But I was going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| before we got too heavy in this debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| ask our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| to please look at the code and the regs to give us the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| of what the standard is by which we can make our decision here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| so the council is real clear about the types of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| and the standard we need to kind of be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| The planned residential zoning category is provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| for in Article 4, Section 4A of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| And among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| it says that every planned residential section must have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| written application that would be reviewed as a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| before it's approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| And that's really where you are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| It says that that application has to be made in conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| with Article 7, Section 5 of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| that has some standards in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Specifically, it provides that the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| and when I say planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| because this is before city council on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| you can substitute city council for planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| because it comes to you for a de novo review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| of what planning commission has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| So everywhere I read in here about the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| it provides for planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| you can simply substitute city council for planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| in this particular hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| It says the planning commission shall review the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| and may give approval, request modification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| or reject the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| A, the planning commission shall review the conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| of the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| recognizing principles of civic design, land use planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| and landscape architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| B, the planning commission may impose conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| regarding layout, circulation, and performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| of the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| and may require that appropriate deed restrictions be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| C, the tract or parcel of land involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| must be either in one ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| or the subject of an application filed jointly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| by the owners of all the property included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| D, the proposed development must be designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| to produce an environment of stable and desirable character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| not out of harmony with its surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| and must provide standards of open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| and areas for parking adequate for the occupancy proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| It must include provisions for recreation areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| to meet the needs of the anticipated population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| Finally, E, it says no building permit shall be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| unless the development plan is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| No occupancy permit shall be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| unless the building inspector has determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| that the project as constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| meets all the requirements of the approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| It referred to Article 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| and specifically with regard to development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| and planned residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| What the code provides is that in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| planned residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| the planning commission, which is you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| shall review plans to determine the compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| of the planned development with the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| and to determine whether the objectives of the zone are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| And then it talks about the administrative procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| that you follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| So those are the standards that are set out in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| with respect to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Mr. Seymour, I've got two quick questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| and then I think I need to yell at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| First off, there's a third entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| to this development, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| The MPC added that at the meeting in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| that after 101 units are built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| that there be an entrance on the Nash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| which is at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| And this is going to be the construction entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| at some point during the development as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| We would anticipate most construction equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| coming off Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| The other question I wanted to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| did you all explore the boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| the idea of expanding the road, and what came of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And have you told Ms. O'Dell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| and the neighborhood folks about the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Well, we explored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| The problem is to widen the road to boulevard standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| would require the elimination of enough parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| to cause Chill Highway Baptist concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| It is a growing church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I think they're cramped for special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| and on Sunday for parking anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And it would destroy parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| They could replace it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| but they would have to move it up the hill far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And they have all age groups attending there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| And the pastor and the engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I was not privy to those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| I passed it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| The word I got back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| and Pastor Crisp is nodding yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| is that it would displace too much parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| for the existing church activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| The...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Earlier in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| before we got into the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| you were asked about compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| You said there was no hope of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| You don't even know what you've agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| You don't even know what the other side has agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| You didn't know that the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| agreed to, what, three forestry buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| What makes you think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| And I'm frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| because this is a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| I mean, this is as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| your side of the argument is this is a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| And I don't see why you can't work some of this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| as close as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| So I'm very frustrated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| And especially when you stand up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| and say with a lot of confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| we can't work out anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| And then I come to discover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| you don't even know what the other side's agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I'm very disappointed in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I have heard from Mrs. O'Dell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| that yesterday, today, several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| that unless there is no access to Eastburn Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| that is a deal killer on arriving at an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| My client's bankers insist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| that there be a secondary entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| That's developments of this size, 190...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| And you have a second entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Only, well, we have it to Eastburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| And the bankers he has talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| I have not talked to his bankers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| are requiring that there be a secondary entrance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| So you wanted to come here and force this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| rather than talk to the bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I don't know why you're not working to get a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| This is a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| We're not that far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| We have met, and Mrs. O'Dell told me last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| she thought and confirmed again today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| that unless Eastburn Drive was closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| that was a deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| We have added restrictions on Eastburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Traffic flows the path of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| We put up resistance at Eastburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Trying to force people to use Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| which I anticipate 90% plus of the people coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| and out of this development will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| There is going to be some traffic on Eastburn Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| if this plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| But we have discouraged that road's use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| for ingress and egress to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Mr. Donaldson, I understand that in the 2001 planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| that Eastburn was recommended not to be used by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| That's what I understand, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| What's changed between that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| and this development from the MPC's position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Well, the mix of uses has changed slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Previously we were talking about apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| They're currently talking about age-restricted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| owner-occupied units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| There has since been a portion of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| already developed as assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| which has had virtually no impact on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And in the planning world, the issue of connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| has increased in focus and as a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| to traffic congestion on our arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Let me just mention this, that connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| it doesn't seem like with two speed bumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| which is what they're proposing, and a key gated gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| that doesn't sound like connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| To me, that's just an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| And, Mr. Seymour, I agree with Councilman Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| that it seems like you're, you know, really, really close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| to a very good development that would be a real boost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| to the area, good for businesses and good for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| and so forth, economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| And my question's somewhat been answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| but I still don't understand why you don't upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| the existing church driveway to a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| to accommodate all the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| until the 101st unit is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Now, you said one of the reasons was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| is that it would take 26 spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| and then you said that it's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| the developers or the bankers require two entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| Is it both, or is it one or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| First, the bankers are requiring a secondary entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| to a project of this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Now, is that immediately with the proposed under 101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| or can you anticipate the over 101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| going to the back entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| You need to move to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| if you're going to speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| My name's Ross Everett, 5716 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| The banks have required two entrances at the outset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| and I've spoken to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| I'll continue talking to as many as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| but I hold out little hope that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Because, I mean, it seems to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| if you could work that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| and it seems to me perfectly good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I've been over there and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| It already looks like that's the way it ought to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| you know, done anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| I just can't understand why we can't get past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| I've driven around the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| and the church property and, you know, parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I think this is a great development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Something can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| What has been notably missing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| in the discussion of all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| is the discussion of the unique characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| of this particular piece of property in terms of slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| And Council just recently, and again tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| added some more members to a study task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| to look at ridges and areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| that had high-slope kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| And typically, in my experience on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| when we have been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| to consider developments like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| we've had numerous pages of testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| from stormwater engineers and earth-moving people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| to let us know how the unique challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| of slope on a particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| are going to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| And, you know, we've seen time and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| that property within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| I mean, the low-hanging fruit's been picked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| So what's left is typically pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| that have some unique challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| And it's difficult for me to make a decision on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| without...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| I don't have any drawings of detention ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| of, you know, how the land is going to be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| or leveled to deal with the slope issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| I can't walk the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| I mean, there's no roads up in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| so all I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| is what I can see from the church parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| But to me, that's a whole area of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| that's just completely missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| And I may let Mr. Donaldson address part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| At the use-on-review stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| according to the property involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| MPC will require different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| In this, they did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| and I'd better let Mr. Donaldson speak for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| see the drainage system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| as an immediate issue at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| There will have to be a drainage plan developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| and it will have to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| with the city's stormwater and street ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| But there are already natural drainage ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| that lead into a stormwater system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| There is at least one detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| already on the property for Trinity Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| There will be at least one more for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| On the slope issue, MPC looks at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| And, again, I don't think the slope issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| was one that they found overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| But the next step, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| is to go forward with your development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| which will require much more detailed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| This is basically a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| for a general layout of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| There is a lot of detailed engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| that will go forward from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| But Mr. Donaldson can probably address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Sometimes they do require a preliminary stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| drainage analysis on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| They have not done so at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| but city engineering will have to be satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Did you all do one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Oh, they said they did one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| It would have been nice if they provided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| in terms of deliberating on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| And I'd also like to know how many vertical feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| of this ridge are being taken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| to accomplish this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Mr. Donaldson did the calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Well, we don't have design plans yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| but the high point on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| is roughly 1,080 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| and that's roughly the elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| that they're showing the three condominium structures on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| I would suspect that there would be earth moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| to create a level building pad there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| but I don't know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| So the multistory buildings are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| on the land that's at the highest point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| And the low point is approximately 880 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| so there's a 200-foot rise or fall across the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| Those two points are more than 2,000 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| so generally there's less than a 10% average grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| which doesn't trigger any of our thresholds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| as far as steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| The 1,080 feet corresponds with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| I've spent part of the day looking at various developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| that are on high points already in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| The football field at Rule High School is at 1,080 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| The Mabry-Hazen house on Dandridge is at 1,060 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Skyline Drive and Sunset Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| in the Holston Hills area are at roughly 1,050 to 1,080 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| So we have a history of developing on our high places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| and a lot of people would argue that that's a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| But the slope generally from south to north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| is not dramatic once you get to the north edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| and drop down to the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| then it becomes extremely dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| But there is a relatively flat spot up on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| And what about detention and stormwater drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| We do have a preliminary drainage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| which shows drainage going to two ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| that are generally on the northern part of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| going into the area that's currently occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| by a baseball, softball field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| and then going into an existing detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| at the southern part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| But it's preliminary in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| and prior to any final platting and pulling of building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| they'll be required to do a design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| approved by the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| And presumably, other than the back portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| where it drops off toward the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| this land generally drains down toward Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| About two-thirds of it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| And then the other third, the northern third...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Drains the other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Relatively flat and drains the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Okay, that's all for now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| I'm really in favor of postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| and encouraging the two sides to meet and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| I heard in Ms. O'Dell's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| that she wanted the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| at one point she mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| She has lots of other concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| but she sees value in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Mr. Seymour wasn't quite clear about their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| I think that we need to encourage the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| and the church to at least speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| within a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| I know people in the church, and I know the pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| and I know that this church wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| the right thing the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| And so I think this provides an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| I did hear the developer mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| that Vice Mayor Brown had been working in this for compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| So I am curious to hear what you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| about postponing it, continuing the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| And you continuing to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Do you want to respond to that, Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| As I stated earlier, I have no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I have encouraged it, and I think we've had several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| You know, to use Mr. Seymour's language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| he says that he thinks there's an impasse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| and as Ms. O'Dell says, they want Eastburn closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| I would encourage, if we can work it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| I've been trying to think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| not from what I personally feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| but kind of from what the neighborhood wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| and also what the developer is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| Since I've been asked this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| you know, I too sit here a little puzzled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| with regards to the issue of the third entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| being required after 101 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| and why that couldn't be used after 101 units, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| and why that couldn't be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| as the second required entrance on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| And I imagine, and I think the other day at our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| the developer really spoke to the issue of cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| of doing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Why would, you know, they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| It would be very expensive for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| to make that a second entrance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Why would they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| You know, it costs them a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| So I heard people asking about that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| but I see that as something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| I also really wonder that if there is some good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| that would occur, hopefully they could visit the whole issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| of 25 parking spaces being moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| from the side of the church to the back of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| especially if the church is very strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| in wanting this project and so committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| and so passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| I've kind of struggled with the boulevard question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| that was asked earlier by Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| So I do think that if those issues are opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| for further discussion, there's possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| and I would encourage that and would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| But if we're going to be right back here with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| as Arthur has said earlier, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Attorney Seymour said earlier, an impasse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| then I think there's no need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| And I have several other points and questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| but those that I just spoke to say to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| two weeks, get back together, could be very beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| if the parties are willing to discuss those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| that I put out there again and revisit those, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| But if not, then I think we may just have two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| of being back here and having the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| to go out and get a bus and get all these people here again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| and, you know, and do all that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| and have people from East Burn come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| and, you know, we all sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| with another packet of this same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| I have a question or two, at least a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| for either Mr. Seymour or one of the development partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| I'll start with you, Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| and if you can't answer it, maybe they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| Going back to the issue of the boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| apparently the objection was taking out parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| and I guess my question is, did you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| or did they look at doing adding a parking lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| on either side of the boulevard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Because one of the most efficient ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| to provide parking when you have a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| is to actually put parallel parking along the sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| to add the eight-foot parking lanes on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| And I'm wondering if that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| if the analysis was done including that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| because that could very well replace any lost parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| So that's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| I'm going to defer to Mr. Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| Before I answer, if I could ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Are you equating a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| with then being the only entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| That is not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Well, we have looked at the boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| We've looked at the parking that's going to eat up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| We've looked at trying to configure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| with island in the middle, island not in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Did you look at it with parallel parking lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| on either side of the traffic lanes of the boulevard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| No, we did not look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Well, that answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| My next question has to do with deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| As you heard, Mr. Swanson, as he read through the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| we acting as the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| can require deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| The 50-plus, 50-year-old plus requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| I assume that we're talking about having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| in deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Would there be any problem in that being required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| by this council so that that's the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| it can be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| And if that weren't put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| it would be in violation of the instructions of this council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Since this is a condominium development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| the developer, before he can sell anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| has to record a master deed, bylaws, homeowners' rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| I don't see that as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| This is the one area where you can discriminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| because of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| You can keep younger people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Mr. Seymour, I have a thank you for that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| I have another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| A few weeks ago, you asked for a two-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| so you could meet with the appellate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| or whatever the term is, Mrs. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| And since then, there have been a couple of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| The first occurred apparently on April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| I have a letter from some folks in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| The Owens is stating that the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| that was held on April 1st, you stated up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| that the meeting could only last one hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| because of a ball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| even though you chose the date of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| And then you took the first half of that hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| to sort of talk about where things stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| before any dialogue could occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| limiting the total amount of dialogue time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| or question and answer or interaction time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| to 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Let me real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Well, part of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Part of it is, but part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| and I was going to say that when I got recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| at the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| and I'm going to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| it's kind of like what Councilman Woodhull just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| At the last council meeting or prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| I recommended to both parties that you get together and meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| It was at my suggestion that they get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| It wasn't that Mr. Seymour asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| He asked what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| I said, I think it's beneficial to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| and I think it would be beneficial to do a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| and have both sides get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| So I don't want to be seen as Mr. Seymour asked for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| and then he's somehow not being forthright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| So he agreed to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| He agreed to it, as both sides did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| But that was my suggestion, that they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| much like the question you just asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| do I think it would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| At that time, I thought it would be beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and hoped that we would be in a better posture today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| But the second part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| I think it's up to you to answer, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| I think I did make that statement at the start of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| because somebody, what time did we start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Do you remember, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| It was 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Somebody was playing that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| I'm sure it was the NCAAs or was it the Lady Vols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| like they are at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| But I made a statement very much like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| But that statement was completely ignored by everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| thank goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| because I think we stayed there for two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Well, that's what I wasn't clear based on this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| And I think everybody had a chance to say what they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| sometimes two or three times before the night was up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| Well, I appreciate that clarification because this made it sound like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| meeting was limited to one hour and you talked for half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| So that's a different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| What I'm hearing is something different from what I'm seeing on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| It went on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Thank you for that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Well, this isn't necessarily a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| It's an observation, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| But the tallest buildings are at the highest point on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| And the proposed tallest buildings in this development plan or concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| to me that seems a little in reverse of what we're typically trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| accomplish with good urban design principles where we put the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| density closest to the major roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| In this case, Magnolia and the Nashville Highway, that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| And it's pretty obvious, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| that the reason for putting the tallest buildings on the highest point is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| You're selling the view to the people that buy those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| And just like you would be in Sevier County or any other place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| and going back to what Councilman Roddy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| we're trying to address ridgetop issues beginning with this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| And you see what happens in communities where they sell based on the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| In other words, you put your highest units, your biggest massing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| your greatest massing of units at the highest point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Well, that helps your view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| But you suddenly become a big part of everybody else's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| So it's like give us our view and we don't care what everyone else sees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| I'm not saying that's the intent, but that's the way it can play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| So we have to be very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| And I think that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| I think in general as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| it seems to me with the development projects that we're looking at and the corridor projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| we're trying to concentrate the highest densities along the major streets and major roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| So I just wanted to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| And that's all I have for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| I have a question for Mr. Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Help me better understand why are your old bankers requiring the east burn entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4868)|
| 1:21:18| There's a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| One of the reasons is, this is the dramatic reason I call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| is if the church were to catch on fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| then the people in our development wouldn't be able to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| And they would see the project going up in flames and people losing their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| Less dramatic than that is if there was an accident on Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| and the traffic was blocked, our people would have a hard time getting in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| What their concern is, is people coming in and buying these things and not being happy with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| and then words burning around, do we have a project that you can't get in and out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| and then we can't sell any more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Do you know for certain what is the maximum number of units you could build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4918)|
| 1:22:06| without having to access east burn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| I've never been told a firm number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| I've heard anything from 20 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Mr. Donaldson, if you know, at what level would MPC require that east burn access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| How many units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| We have a longstanding policy to require a second entrance when a project reaches 150 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4947)|
| 1:22:37| So, as far as MPC is concerned, there could be 149 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| and no access to east burn would be mandated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Well, it's not codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| We strongly suggest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| But that wouldn't be one of your recommendations then if there was under 150, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I do appreciate the discussion and the comments and especially that last question there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| because I've heard something totally different than what I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| Mr. Donaldson, Council Member Roddy asked a question earlier and I did not get the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=4992)|
| 1:23:22| Maybe she understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| And really the answer was how much of the mountain is going to have to come off in order to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| or in contemplation of building these three five-story condominiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| And I think you said it's going to be the same height as it is now, 1,080 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| So, I almost started to do the math and say, well, if you take five stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| and five stories are X number of feet, is that what you're telling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| How much has to come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| I had heard 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| We have detailed plans, so anything would be purely speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| But the location of the tallest buildings is at the highest point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| and they would have to create some sort of a building pad, so there would be earth removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Do we have any idea how tall these buildings will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| Arthur, do you have any idea how tall five stories is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| It's going to be under 55 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| That includes the HVAC on the top, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| So, without having the complete plan, not being a mathematician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| we may be looking at 40 or 50 feet in some places coming off this mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Keep it at 1,080?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| I better defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Keith Pope, the builders that we're working with on this have told us 15 to 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| on the top of that hill would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| That's how much we would have to remove to make the site balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| So, well, with that math, then it would be taller than the mountain is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| If you only take 15 or 20 feet off the top at most and it's 1,080 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| is that what you said, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| And you add 55 to that, you're going to be a little taller than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| Subtract 15 and you add 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| In some spots at the highest point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Am I bad on beckoning this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| Am I beckoning to the math the wrong way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Well, if the effort is to determine at what elevation the top of the roof is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| yeah, the top of the roof is going to be taller than the existing high point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| of the ground now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| You know, and Councilman Becker, Councilman Bailey, and Councilman Woodhull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| all three alluded to the fact and maybe even Councilman Holquist of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| frustration in hopes that the parties could come together, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| and that maybe there's still a possibility of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| You know, I would hope that there would be a possibility of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| I don't know if Mr. Seymour still feels there's an impasse based on some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| discussion, based on what Ms. O'Dell has basically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| at least with regards to the stories of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| I've been to several meetings and been trying to be very careful not to say one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| or the other kind of what my feelings are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| other than say what I have some general concerns about with regards to the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| in hopes that folk would work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| And I don't want us to engage, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| in negotiations or a bidding process right now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| with the developer or with Mr. Seymour or with the pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| But it seems to me that this whole issue at Eastburn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| there's got to be a way to kind of work around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Now, personally, since we're on the public record, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| I have concerns about three, five-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| And I've said that one-on-one to the developer and to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| I do have concerns about three, five-story buildings sitting on that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| I have concerns about whether or not they are in character with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| and also are in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| I have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| You know, I think most people, if they were to be honest with themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| would say whether it's 500 feet or 700 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| they would prefer not to have three, five-story condominium buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| that close to their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| You know, if they're going to be honest with themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| and whether or not they would be consistent with the character of any neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| other than one that, you know, is already consistent with such type developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| when you're especially looking at an area like Eastburn with the smaller lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| the smaller ranch-style houses, you know, the very established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| So I do have a concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| But I am willing to sit back and say if there is a compromise that can be reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| and it ends up being a little higher than I would preferably like it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| if we can reach a compromise, I would be willing to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| You know, I have great concerns about the adverse impact of the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| of the neighborhood and the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| This is a very dynamic church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I have personally seen them out working in our neighborhoods and knocking on doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| and encouraging folk to come to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| I've seen them encouraging folk to come to our special Christmas programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| I'm really delighted in seeing the little lights at Christmastime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| in the bags around their driveway, all the great things that they do out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| But it's also a very, very large church and already has a traffic issue in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| You know, and on Sundays and on special occasions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I'm beginning to notice that they even have to have some assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| in getting folk in and out of their lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| So I do think that the traffic concern is a very real concern for the folk on Eastburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| and with regards to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| Just as we've heard there's an impasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| With regards to the issue up on the top side of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| the required third entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| and Mr. Donaldson just basically said they don't require a second entrance until 150 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| Mr. King just said he doesn't know of any requirement from the fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| about two entrances at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| I hear that the bank is requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Why is it that we cannot deal with Nash Avenue at this juncture and make it a second entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| Why is that off the table, if it is off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| That's something you all can take back and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Can you go back and talk about Nash being considered, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| as a second entrance and closing Eastburn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| Can you go back and revisit the issue of 25 parking spaces to make what this church feels very passionate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| and what the neighborhood is saying they're willing to deal with and accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Can you revisit that issue and then get together to figure out if there's a resolution of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| Now, I don't want to put you guys on the spot and ask you to give a definitive answer right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| to that Mr. Seymour or Pastor Chris or the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Maybe you guys need to sit back and talk, and we postpone two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| and you sit down and talk and see can we make that work and talk with Ms. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| Quite frankly, you know, I think they don't want to say this to encourage anybody one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| but, you know, them saying that four stories can work for them, I think it is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| Now, I understand MPC has done its approval, and I've gotten a lot of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| some of which I've been able to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| But I do think, you know, folk kind of dealing with the whole idea of four-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| three of them within 500 to 600 or 700 feet of their homes, you know, four four-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| I think it's three four-story, but you proposed four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| They said three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Four three story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Four three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Four three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| If she is agreeing, and I did not hear that when I talked to Ms. O'Dell last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| Can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| And we don't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| Is it worth having a 20-minute postponement, and we can go on about some business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| And since everybody's here, they don't have to leave and maybe come back two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| You all could have a conversation if you think it's helpful, and we could handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| What I would rather suggest is not a 20-minute post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| Well, you did say we go on with other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Do we just go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| I think it's appropriate for us to take that and be perceived at all as falling into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| bailiwick that happened on commission, and somehow everybody dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| No, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| If you guys want to go out and talk for 20 minutes, you move on and move it back to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| little later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| Yeah, let me be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| I just would suggest we postpone until they come back in 10 minutes or 30 minutes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| say deal or no deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| We just go on and handle the business that's before us and keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| You know, the questions that I have put out there are the ones I think that need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| You know, just to let you know where I'm coming from, I have big concerns about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| compatibility of those buildings, but I hear the neighbors saying they're willing to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| I'm a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| I'm a lot closer than probably everybody in here but the folk who are over on Eastburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| and Judge Bozeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| So I would encourage that, Mr. Seymour, if you all are willing to sit down and have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| kind of discussion, and we can move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Can we limit the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| I'll have three of my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| If Ms. O'Dell could bring two people with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| That's been part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| What we will do is the minute you are ready to talk, we will come back to that item on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| But counsel needs to approve this before you take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| I move that a postponement began at this time and end at the time that the parties come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| back to tell us they are ready to give us their conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Raise your hand since there's lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| Any discussion on that motion to postpone until the parties come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| Well, actually, let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| We only asked Arthur if he was good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Ms. O'Dell, does this seem like a good idea to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| I just feel like we're kind of being pushed into a little box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| I mean, I'm not saying that I disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| I'm just saying that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Come to the mic so that we can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Ms. E, I feel that that's actually a good...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Thank you, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| That's actually a good request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I think what you're hearing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Let me just speak real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| As counsel is saying, this feels like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Because I heard Sarpy say, this feels like a good project but with some significant things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| that the neighborhood should be worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| It also feels like from where we sit that this kind of can be worked out and we'd love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| to give you a chance rather than sending everybody home for two weeks and coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| And I guess, Ms. O'Dell, I know that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Ms. O'Dell, I know that feeling of getting put in a box and it might be worth thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| I'm going to say my expectation of what you come back and say is that it's worth taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| time to talk further as opposed to we've got it worked out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| If that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Thank you, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| If I just may...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| There's no point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| In talking to Mr. Donaldson, Eastburn is open now and I think we're missing some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| Eastburn's an open road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| It's closed because the pastor...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| That is not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Well, I think we understand the disagreement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| I think everybody here understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Before they go out, though, Mr. Donaldson, Eastburn is not an open road right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| It's very important...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Whoa, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| We need to follow council rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| So, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Eastburn is a platted right-of-way up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| There is no extension of that right-of-way through the property...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| ...at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| If they wanted to put a little driveway to connect to that, that's okay, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| a right-of-way road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| This property does have frontage on Eastburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| We haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| So, anybody else want to comment on that before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| And then I want to say something real quick before we take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| We're ready to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Mr. Hawkins, do you have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| I just echo what Councilman Becker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| All those in favor of postponing periodic for a little while, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Let me...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| And let me say this, if I could, if everybody could, before you leave, to the church and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Regardless...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| We understand the passions involved here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Nothing brings out passion like land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| I mean, it just doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| And we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Let me just remind everybody of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| Regardless of what happens tonight, this church is still going to be there and be a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| church with a great mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| The neighborhood is still going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| If there's a way to work this out, I think you hear a strong sentiment coming that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| seems like something that's a good project, but with some worthy objections and is worthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| of some really heartfelt, fair discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| Let me also just very quickly agree with Councilman Becker and what Councilman Hawkins has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| I don't want either of the parties, the pastor, the developer, or Ms. O'Dell, to feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| we are pressuring them to come back with an answer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| It may be that you all say, hey, because besides the Eastburn, I think we've got to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| of the deed restrictions and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| So it may be that the answer is let's put it off two weeks, and that way we can make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| and put a nice, neat bow around it if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| And because I'm real concerned that in the heat and passion of everything, people may agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| with some things that in the morning they wake up and go, wow, I wish I felt pressed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| I wish I had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| So as you discuss, just be cognizant of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Sometimes time is a cooler and allow folks to really think rationally and come up with the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| possible scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| Pastor, do you have a brief word to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| I do just have a brief word, Mayor, and that is I think we need to use as much as we can language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| that unites us instead of divides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| It's not the church and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| The church is part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| It is not the church versus the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| I am a neighbor, vice mayor is a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| And so it's not the church versus the neighbors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| It is some within the neighborhood and others that have opposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| And that's language that divides, in my opinion, not unites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| I'd just like for us to use that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| It's like the neighborhood is against the church and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| That's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| We're postponing that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| We will move on to the next item until they return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5853)|

| 1:38:35| Just come back to me after the item is voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5919)|

| 1:38:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Yeah, I was going to say I've heard that the Fulton Boys basketball team has been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| waiting a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Oh, I didn't even know they were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5930)|

| 1:38:52| I didn't see them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| They're not that far on the agenda, but I was going to suggest that we do the items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| but if there's discussion, we postpone it because it's like four items away, but I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| to get a discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5943)|

| 1:39:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| We'll move 11-I to the agenda right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5948)|

| 1:39:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| I didn't know they were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| I didn't either, and I'm glad somebody told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| 11-I is a resolution honoring and congratulating the Fulton High School Boys basketball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| for winning the state AA Boys basketball championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| I think if there's some representatives of the team here...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5970)|
| 1:39:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Actually, maybe they're not here any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| Regardless, hopefully they're watching on TV and they heard council's appreciation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| but Coach Jody Wright and the Fulton High basketball team did win their first state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| basketball championship, and it really was a great game, and it was a fun team to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| I think several folks here got to see them play this year, so well noted, and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| pass along to Jody and their entire team our congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6015)|

| 1:40:21| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| We are, but I see Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| I was going to say, not only to say congratulations, my son attended Fulton and has three football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| championships, and I know Jody Wright and those guys, it's a great job, and I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| we're going to make sure that this is a well-done proclamation, do it up in our special fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| and get it submitted to them so that if they wish to display it, they can display it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| We will make sure we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6045)|

| 1:41:23| or does this impact the farmer's market on Market Square?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| I'm trying to get a better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6088)|

| 1:41:38| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Kind of what I thought from looking at it, but just was trying to get a better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Vice Mayor, is that an old light or new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| They're probably not going to answer to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| I remember the motion and then Councilman Becker's suggestion, but I wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6110)|

| 1:43:12| This says it's in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6192)|

| 1:43:47| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Mr. Anderson, I have a question for you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| Obviously, this is a patch to a building that has some significant issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| What are the alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| I suppose it's to spend a lot more money and build a new building or move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| Long term, what are our projections for the life of this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| Cindy McGinnis is here, the CAT Director, and she can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| While she's coming up, I just want to say this is when the 1st District claims Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| And you're right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| I just noticed this building is only 20 years old, which I don't think in the life of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| building shouldn't be that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| What happens when you get put in the 1st District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Cindy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| We discussed several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| One option was to do nothing, and that was determined not to be the preferable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| And the building has settled slightly, and in order to allay future settling, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| decided that this project would be the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| I remember, didn't we approve a contract prior to this when we hired the geotechnical engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| to assess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| That was for the engineering and the surveying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| I guess the missing link for me were the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| I remember approving the money to do the study, and then, you know, this is the preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| alternative, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| I don't need all the details in between, but sometimes it's helpful to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| this was option A, B, and C, and we picked this preferred alternative because of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| strong reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Mr. King may have the more technical answer that you desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| Well, I helped Kat a little bit with the review of the document that Foundation Systems did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| and they recommended this course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| Really, what's going on with that building, there is, as in many locations in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| there's underground caverns, and they're experiencing settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| What this project will do is inject grout to stabilize those areas that are settling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| So, I think this is a permanent structural fix to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| Now, there may be things in the future as far as interior renovations, but as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| the structural problem, we feel like this will repair the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6365)|

| 1:46:10| I thought with the karst in East Tennessee, you just kind of never knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Well, you never really know because you don't know what's going on hundreds of feet underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| but the best that we can determine using this geotechnical engineer, we think this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| permanent fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| You know, this is kind of an amazing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| I happened to know about it because our driveway sank, and we had to put boards there so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| we could drive up into our garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| And basically, it was great news we learned from our neighbor, who owns a lot of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| stations, that he constantly is having to shore up his aprons on his service station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| with this type of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6411)|
| 1:47:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6428)|
| 1:47:25| Mr. King, obviously, if you look at the breakdown, the majority of the cost listed here is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| over $110,000, and then second to that is about 10 percent of that for the actual grouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| So, if they do encounter problems, would you say it's more likely that they wouldn't have to drill a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| whole lot more, but they might have to inject additional grout because it's hard to estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| It is hard to estimate the volume of grout, so that can overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| But given the cost breakdown here, it looks like grout is less expensive than drilling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| so that may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Even if they got into more grout, the cost overrun probably wouldn't be that substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6486)|

| 1:49:14| Mr. Edmond, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| I think Mr. Becker thinks you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| My name is Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane out in Norwood Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| Councilman Becker was gracious enough to postpone this action for two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| to give our citizens a chance to see if we could find a better location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| for our recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| We are unable to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| We are not going to stand in the way of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| However, what's before you is not the recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| It is a rezoning to – it's a split piece of property right now, part R1, part C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| The motion will make it all C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| It will go toward the existing houses on Mettler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| David Brace of the city has stated to us openly that they don't need this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| to do the recycle center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| I would encourage council to turn it down since it's not needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| and even half this lot will give a little bit more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| It's not needed and even half this lot will give a little bit of buffer protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| to the existing neighbors over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| Councilman Becker, any follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| I was going to say the city doesn't need it and just to check with, I guess, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| That's your understanding as well, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Your understanding is that we don't need this property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| to do the recycling center, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| I think the city, along with Goodwill, made the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| because the parcel is split zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| But the center can be built on the part that's currently zoned C4, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6641)|
| 1:50:50| I don't feel strongly one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| If anybody has any strong feelings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| Ms. Riley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| I feel strongly that the portion that is still zoned residential provides a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| for those homes that are adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| And although a split zone is perhaps not preferable land use policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| I think in this particular case, it's preferable to continue the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| if the recycling center can still coexist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| As I've said before, zoning lasts forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| And if the entire parcel goes C4 and the recycling center goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| and some other use comes in that's egregious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| I would have great concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| So I move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6690)|

| 1:51:37| I was planning to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=6697)|
