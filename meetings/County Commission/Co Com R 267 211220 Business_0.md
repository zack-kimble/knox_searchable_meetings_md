| 0:01:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| As we come to a point of the year where we celebrate the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| I would like to remind everyone that while many people consider this the happiest time of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| for those that have lost, those that are suffering from depression, this can be a very trying time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| Also, as Chairman, our Chairman does not get to do a devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| And as a pastor, I think he is the most qualified to give us our devotion before Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| So, Chairman Begler, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Well, thank you, Commissioner. I'd be honored to lead us in a word of prayer if you'll bow your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| Father, we do come to you tonight with a lot of joy in our hearts because of the time of year that we love so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=128)|
| 0:02:17| I pray that in the midst of it all, we are reminded that the reason for the joy is because of the hope that came into the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| in the baby in Bethlehem, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| We know that in the midst of it all, Lord, there's a lot of suffering around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| There are people that hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| There are people who have lost a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| And we know how magnified those losses and those hurts can be during a time of year when everybody is celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| So I just thank you, Father, that you are not a God who is unaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| You're not a God who doesn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| You are not a God who is disconnected from the suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| In fact, you are a God who stepped into the suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| And you suffered with us and for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| And for that, we praise your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| We pray for wisdom over this body tonight and over all those participating in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you for the hope that Christmas gives us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| In Jesus' name, I pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=196)|

| 0:20:04| In its place, I just want to bring up one thing that I know is dear to all of your hearts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and that's infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| So we at the Chamber have just completed the last piece of our Path to Prosperity Strategic Vision recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| which is an infrastructure strategy called Infrastructure Redefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| I think we sent it off to you all, but if you don't have it, we're happy to get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| It aligns very closely with what you all are working on, with the mayor's office is working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| especially with the update to the general plan that you all are proceeding with forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| It has three major recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| One is to advocate for short and long-term traffic congestion relieving plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1239)|
| 0:20:48| If you look at a lot of the metros that are typically referred to as these economic superstars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| many of them are starting to fall down under their own weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| because they did not properly plan for the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| whether it be roads, bridges, planning, those other things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| and we don't want that to happen to us, so we're trying to get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| A second piece of this is we've talked about this before when I've come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| Infrastructure plays a significant role in workforce development, talent retention and attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| as well as business recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| And so we want to really support policies and plans that will help us do that as we continue to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| and we continue to move forward in our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| And finally, it is more than just roads and bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| It is land policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| It is ensuring that we have the right buildings to support the companies here that are trying to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| making sure that we have the land availability as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| So we think we got all those captured in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| We worked with a lot of groups, NPO, Knox County Planning, TDOT, and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1309)|
| 0:21:58| So I hope we captured as much as we could on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Any questions for Mr. Odom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Merry Christmas Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Update on property tax bills by Knox County Trustee Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| Welcome, Mr. Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you, Chairman Beeler and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| I hope I have better news than I had a few weeks ago, last time before this esteemed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| I think you were sitting as a finance committee then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| I haven't heard from any of you in the last week or two, well, maybe one or two of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| that you haven't got your tax bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| So I hope that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| If you haven't got it by now, it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| I'm going to blame the post office because we've got over 120,000 in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| We took them in batches as I sent you a few emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| I think Mr. J, Commissioner J started asking for some details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and we responded every day or two as we were getting them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| I think we started at 38,000, then 21,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| See, I was here on the 17th of November, and we started dropping the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| That weekend, we started dropping some, and we dropped a lot Thanksgiving week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| which that was a mixed-up week, and that was a three-day week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| But nevertheless, I found no rhyme or reason to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| I'm in 37919, sort of the Bearden area, and I have two parcels that I get billed for directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1420)|
| 0:23:50| That batch went to the post office, say, on a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| I got a bill the following day, and then seven days later, I got the second bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| I guess I'm trying to blame the post office for some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| I never knew we were the reason or the software snafu was the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| that we couldn't get them out the last week of September as we traditionally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Our cash flow is recovering rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| We will soon, I hope by the end of the year, we may not have it to where we were this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| That being the heavy COVID, the dollars came in stronger during the depths of the COVID crisis a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1463)|
| 0:24:33| than they had in previous years, but nevertheless, I think we will recover the bulk of that by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| I may even, Finance Director Caldwell and I have had some conversations about reestablishing our bond portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| Those of you on the Investment Committee are aware of that, and we follow that daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| I don't want to digress because you're here to hear about property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| but as you know, we earn 50 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| That's half of a point at First Bank, and the three-year treasury that I can invest in is between 88,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| has been up to 103 in the last couple of weeks, so if we can pick up some additional yield there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| we will certainly look at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| I was asked in a conversation with Commissioner Schoonmaker last week, the dollars expended to EGov implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1518)|
| 0:25:30| I had a discussion with Finance Director Caldwell again this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| The implementation, there were four implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| That's a one-time charge, $135,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| The annual licensing fee, which would be a recurring fee, $244,935,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1543)|
| 0:25:51| so $380,595 has been paid to EGov as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1551)|
| 0:26:01| There's still a lot of work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Obviously, the property tax, sending those bills out to you, to me, to people in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| all the 470,000 taxpayers of Knox County, that's the biggest, highest-profile thing we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1571)|
| 0:26:19| and so that's what caused the agony on our part and the concern on your part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| and on the finance department's in that the cash flow, would it be impacted negatively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| Of course, yes, it had to be impacted negatively, but because of our strong balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| it was never any real issue that we started worrying about making payroll or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| That was never even remotely the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| but there's still a tremendous amount of back-office work to be done in implementing this software package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| To give you an example, we had our wire transfer last week from something called CoreLogic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| That's a consolidator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Home Federal, they bring a check down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| TVA Credit brings a check down, but Wells Fargo, Bank of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| all these huge mortgage lenders are out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| They use a third party called CoreLogic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| and they consolidate 59,000 Knox County taxpayers into one payment to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| That came in last week, $60,250,000, again, representing 59,000 taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| When that hit our system, it took us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| We tried to filter that into the 59,000 mortgages holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| It took our system down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| We were offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| If you went online to pay your taxes Friday night, you couldn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| or you could better than me because we were down several days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| That's part of the software, and there's some other issues that we have to work through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| but primarily us getting the eGov package functional to do what it's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1672)|
| 0:28:01| I'm not here to give you any excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| We're just happy we were able to follow through on what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| What we were told by our vendor also that would happen Thanksgiving week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| we still have delinquent bills to send out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| but we are caught up on your personal real estate property or your real estate bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| You should have gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| That's, I guess, the gist of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Again, I hope it's better news than what I had four weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| I'll certainly entertain any questions or suggestions from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| I want to call on Commissioner Jay and then Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you, Mr. Shouts, for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| I think we're all pleased to hear that things are out and the response is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| and the cash flow is rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| While you're still working through some of the issues on the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| are you getting the support that you need from the EGLE team to be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Is the level of attention at the same level where it was when they appeared before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and are they seeing it sort of finishing the game here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| We got the level of attention after that meeting 33 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| The gentleman that was here followed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| I think he got the message from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| That attention fell off the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| We had a long discussion Thursday with their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1779)|
| 0:29:48| This gentleman was not involved, but he became involved the next day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| and it has picked back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| It's picked back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I will not say it's the level that I wish it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| but it's to the level I think we can make things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| It can be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you for the update, and if we can be of assistance, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Trustee Schaus, like you, I do have two parcels that I get a property tax bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| I want to let you know that on last Wednesday, the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| I did receive both of those in the mail at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Good. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| On the payments to EGOV, is there any outstanding payments that they're due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| That we owe them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| We made that payment when we first started hitting rough orders three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| We considered withholding that payment, but it was we thought that might make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| bad matters worse, so we did submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| That's at $244,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| We are current with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Then under the contract that you had with EGOV, because they missed deliverables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| was there any financial penalty to EGOV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Discussions I've had with the law department, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| I'm not aware of any way to recover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| The lost interest revenue that we would have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| I think David might want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I think Charlie Sturkey researched that, and that was in a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| I don't think we had a way to recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| It wasn't big dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| I mean, it was down to probably approaching $1,000 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| because that's $30,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Then at the close of business this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| do you think you'll be 90% that you have collected compared to the previous year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| What kind of percentage do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I'm hoping I will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| It's coming in very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| People are coming out to pay their bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| They're walking to our office, our other offices around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| I'll be happy to give you a report at the end of the year to let you know where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| It would be a good exercise for me, because I monitor it virtually every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| and we're eating away at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| As I was sitting here, we were down roughly $12 million compared to this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| So to stipulate that out, that's down to like $165 a day in lost interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| So, again, a lot of money, but in the scope of $200 million, not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| Well, personally, I'd just like to say I appreciate your dedication in following through with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| I know a lot of people would have probably just thrown up their hands and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| I'm out of here, but I know that was probably a lot of sleepless nights for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| I appreciate your dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I want to thank my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| They're the ones who are in the trenches really doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and I've still got people upstairs now working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| and I don't know when we'll get back to normal hours, but that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| We appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Ed, you said whenever the big check came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| and you tried to process the 59,000 parcels that the system shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| you were able, I guess, to work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| But is there a way to run a stimulation to make sure this doesn't happen again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| whenever this large deposit comes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Well, we'll have to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I don't know if there's a way, but we'll do our best to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| The money came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| We have the money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| We're earning it, but it just didn't hit the 59,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| It's parceling it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| If you've got a mortgage, you might not be credited as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| There's no penalty to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| There's no downside to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| But when you put that in, the system was unable to interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| where to put all those pieces for credit to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| I'm assuming that was kind of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| So they went in and manually fixed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| It's still being processed as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Is there a way then in this system to offline run a stimulation again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| before we get to next year to see if the same thing is going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| That's something we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I mean, obviously I won't be the trustee a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| but I want to leave this in the best hands possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| and the best system possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| And when we figure out what happened and why it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| we'll make sure to do our absolute best it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| That's probably for someone who's much more a computer science person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| than I am, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Seeing no more lights on, Mr. Shouse, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| For the update, for all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| At this time, we will move into the first segment of public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| related to agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| And I want to first, to begin that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| invite Sheriff Spangler to the podium for a special recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2118)|
| 0:35:34| Welcome, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Real quick, what I would like to do is recognize some of our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| and some of the things that they've been doing and have done, should I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| I think you'll remember a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| even Commissioner Biggs brought up about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| recognizing somebody who put out a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| And I told him I was way ahead of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| It's just now that we're getting to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| But what I will say is that what you'll start seeing after the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| every quarter, you're going to see our officers of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| and our officer of the year come in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| because I think it's important not only to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| but for you to see what these officers have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| and are doing within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| So with that being said, I first would like to call down here to the lectern with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| It would be Officer Robert Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| And if he has any supervisors with him, I'd like for them to come as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2182)|
| 0:36:36| This is Officer Simpson, and along with him is Captain Brian Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Back in October of this year, at approximately 1742 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| for those of you, that's 542,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Officer Simpson observed a female on the side of Chaud Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| screaming for someone to help her one-year-old child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Officer Simpson observed a small child lying on the ground not breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| After feeling no pulse, Officer Simpson helped perform CPR on the child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| and Officer Simpson, along with that assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| was successfully able to get the child breathing before the first responders arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| With that being said, this is an everyday occurrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| and I say everyday occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| This is what goes on on a daily basis with these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| But we want to make sure that we recognize them for the job that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| because it's not just putting somebody in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| It's not just writing a citation to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| It also shows the compassion that these officers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| And for his diligence and even willingness to pull over somebody screaming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| not knowing what's going on, again, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| We go into the fire and not run away from it, not to take away from fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| I don't mean it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| But to show the courage that this individual made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| And I wanted to be able to show you all the video of that when I watched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| It's very heart-riching to watch a 1-year-old lay on the ground not breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| But you can imagine that on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| But I want to say to him and his fellow officers and his supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| which the supervisors have a lot to say about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| and a lot to do about the way these officers operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| And so with that, I want to say thank you to both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Thank you for what you did and for saving a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2305)|
| 0:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| He was going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| He's down with laryngitis right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I don't know if that was on purpose or if it's just his way of getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Next I'd like to call down would be Officers Doster, Stainback, and Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2330)|
| 0:39:02| And their supervisors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2342)|
| 0:39:21| And along with Officer Monroe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| And as you see behind them, their supervisors, four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| We've got Captain, three sergeants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| So it says an awful lot of the support that these men have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| And this happened back in October, approximately about 1.30 p.m. in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| These officers were on their way to a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| These officers were on their way to a call and observed smoke coming from what they appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| or at least thought was coming from a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| They detoured off of that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| And sure enough, when they pulled into the subdivision and got down a road to the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| there was a truck, a pickup truck that was fully engulfed sitting beside a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| And obviously the home was starting to melt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| The garage was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| And obviously these officers went out, started knocking on doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| making sure that people got away from the danger that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| and also grabbing anything and everything they could to help with whatever it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| to help put that fire out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| And on the video you see, I believe it's Officer Doster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| gets a water hose from a next-door neighbor's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| and it only stretches to the edge of the driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| so he's having to arch this water over into this truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| But doing that, he continually stayed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| while the other officers assisted, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| whether it be knocking on doors and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Again, these officers are on their way to the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| No hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Smoke's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Obviously it's very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| It's a lot of smoke coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| And here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| These officers go into it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| And this is the one that Commissioner Biggs was referring to about helping put a fire out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| If they had not done what they did at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| that house would have probably had been gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| The garage was already starting to melt heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| And with their assistance, before rural metro arrived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| and I'm sorry that he's not here, Jeff Bagwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| because on the video he made the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I always knew that policemen always wanted to be a fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| I'm not sure how he meant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| But with that being said, I want to say to these men, thank you, congratulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| and to the supervisors, because I know this group of supervisors right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| put a lot into their people and expect a lot from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| but the support that they give them means more to me than it does to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| So, guys, thank you and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| I gave them an opportunity to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2511)|
| 0:42:05| They said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| I think you recognize a couple of them from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Last one I have, and as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| these are either people who have been nominated for Officer of the Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| and or recognized for a letter of accommodation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| and we want to make sure that we recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| We do that and have been doing that for the past three years up until COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| We would recognize them with a dinner every quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| and recognize all of those and give them their awards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| So we want to continue doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Last but not least, I'd like for Captain Jeff Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| to come down with his supervisors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Captain Smith is one of our correction lieutenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| and the story I'm about to tell you here is totally away from corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| but it tells you what these men and women do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| With him is Chief Purvis, who is over our jails, all three of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| Back in November, Captain Smith, while off duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| while driving on Cemetery Road, which is in Maryville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| heading back from his house when he noticed black smoke coming from near a church building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| When he pulled in the parking lot of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| he discovered a vehicle that was totally engulfed in flames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| When he exited his vehicle, he observed a female exit from the vehicle that was on fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| not just the vehicle, but her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| The female was charred and smoking, turned away from Captain Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| and began walking back to the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Captain Smith prevented her from reentering the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| and instructed her to get away from the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| She complied and walked her to a safe distance from the burning vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Captain Smith notified 911 of the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| and had Fire, EMS, and Blount County Sheriff's Office respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| The thing about this was, again, walking into the fire and not away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| But what he didn't know at the time with this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| was attempting to commit suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| She was trying to get back to the car, and he pulled her away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| not knowing the situation and not knowing what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Off-duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| So these men and women, again, we run to the problem, not away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| And I want to say congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Most of all, I want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Anybody could have turned away and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| it's not my deal, it's not in my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| But with that, I'd like to also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| He was recognized by the Blount County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| at their employee appreciation luncheon this past Friday for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| So he was awarded and recognized for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| So, again, with that, I want to say thank you and congratulations for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2691)|
| 0:45:01| Commissioners, thank you for allowing me to come in front of you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| and take up some of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| But, again, I think it's important that you know what these men and women do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and are going to do for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Commissioner and Mr. Chairman, could we take just a minute to recognize Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| This is his birthday today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| I think I'm going to pay for that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I can see the evil eye from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| I thought you were going to see him there for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| but fortunately it was a narrow escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Mr. Murphy has signed up to speak on two items that are on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| items 26 and 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| If you'll state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| You have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| I'll waive speaking on item 48, so just addressing item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Speaking tonight in my capacity as an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| and this was the approval of all the funds in the plan for the American Rescue Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| First, I do think those are, you know, I've read what our plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| Those are all really good uses of the funds, appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| You know, I'm glad that we're doing that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| Where I was concerned is, you know, these are windfall grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| and as I looked at a number of these, I said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| these look like these are things that we should be funding through our normal course of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| you know, county government, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| So they aren't free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| You know, we aren't taking on debt for this at a local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| but we are at a national level to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| And that's something I felt strongly enough that I wanted to bring up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| You know, some of the examples, again, I think these are all good uses of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| but, you know, the question is, you know, are these uses that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| should be like a one-time, you know, opportunistic one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| or are they things that we should be funding on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Like, you know, there's a million in the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| 1.4 million for criminal court software upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| and it's important that we do keep our software up to date to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| And we've got $6.3 million for stormwater projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| a number of which are listed as critical needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| Stormwater control, prevention, and all that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| and something I think we should probably be doing on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| Water and wastewater projects, $41.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| and that's going to our utility districts for, you know, these are needed projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| A lot of it is driven by, you know, the exponential growth we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| but I know that West Knox Utility District, you know, they sent in a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| and one of the things they said is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| they stated that the increased revenue that they're getting from new subscribers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| isn't sufficient to meet the increased infrastructure demand from these subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| So, you know, their rate structure isn't matching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| So, you know, these are, you know, those are some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| We've got, you know, $4.7 million for the Shod Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| That's a great, you know, to get that done a little bit faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| You know, $1.75 million for greenways and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| Again, all of these are great, great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| but, you know, that's, you know, in the area of $60 million, $70 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| something like that of, you know, things that should, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| probably should be regular expenses that we should be incurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| So I know it's never, you know, popular to raise utility rates or taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| I do understand in our country we have a funding model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| where some stuff comes from the federal government like the school lunch program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| even though it could be locally funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| We don't locally fund our schools, but the lunch program comes from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| But, you know, this is something, you know, that I hope that we ask ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| you know, are we doing enough right now to fund our infrastructure, our parks, our utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| You know, some of the things we should regularly be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| You know, it's kind of like if you run a little short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| and you have to ask for money from a family member or somebody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| You know, sometimes it's okay to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| but you also want to make sure that you kind of fix things so you don't have to ask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| So that's, you know, these are things, you know, I hope we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| But, you know, I certainly hope, you know, that we can look and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| how do we avoid having to ask, you know, depend on windfall projects in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| This concludes the first segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| We will move through the remainder of our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| and then we will entertain public forum again at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=2965)|

| 0:54:37| It looks like 2022 will be even more active, and we know that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| use decisions, they're the hard ones, they're the most controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| ones, so that's probably coming up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| I just wanted to give you an idea of what we hear when KCPA, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| talk to neighbors and they engage with us and they ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| One of the first things they say is how do they do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Doesn't, you know, the sector plan, doesn't it say, you know, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| parcel should be, you know, this X here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| And, you know, that's the first thing they always ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| And so on that note, we are really happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| We're starting on the updates to the general plan and the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| That is the big picture look that we really need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| You know, KCPA, we're 100% for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| But between now and when that plan update is complete, we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| have 12 land use plans today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Those are all in the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| And they're 5 to 10 years old, but they represent the most up-to-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| thing that we have, and KCPA, we're here asking you to really think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| you know, hard about, you know, upholding those plans between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| and when we do finish this general land use update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| You know, why is it kind of important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Well, the plans, you know, there are criteria for amending the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| plans, but, you know, the criteria are wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| You can drive a bus through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| You can come up with a really loose reason for it, like, you know, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| new stoplight, a widened road that's a few miles away, sewer, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| having become available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Or, you know, the generic one is, you know, that there's just increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| residential housing demand, and that can apply to any parcel in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| So it's really easy to update the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| And they are, you know, updates, they're legislative in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| You have the authority to do that, and as long as there's some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| of, you know, if there's a reason, then the courts are going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| But with that great legislative authority you have is great responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| And that's, you know, one of the things that we hear all the time is we hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| you know, we need planning commission and county commission to really look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| at the big picture when the land use plan, the sector plans are amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| You have to figure out, you know, if the things that, you know, if amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| this, you know, is that in an area where we're on track for utilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| parks and providing the increased emergency services and schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| education, you know, all that's considered when you do the full sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| So that's, you know, kind of a good basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| But when we do it one by one afterwards, those, you know, those are questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| that often don't get asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| So that's, you know, that's really the reason that I'm here today, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| is about, you know, that it's tough when we do those land use amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| you know, case by case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| One thing, you know, there'll be an item I think next month that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| considered this month, the sector plan at planning commission and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| And it gave 163 more students, you know, into the three Hardin Valley schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| And those three schools are currently 610 students over capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| So we already have a school system, schools that are overburdened by a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| and we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| The community identified this as a potential impact, and they asked what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| plan is to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| And they did reach out to the school board office and the school board rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| and didn't hear back before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| And then at the planning commission meeting, nobody engaged and asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| well, are the schools here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Can they answer this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Can they talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| And that's really the discussion that when, you know, we have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| dialogue with neighborhoods, and they wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| why aren't these questions getting asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Why are we just kind of looking like, well, this kind of looks okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| You know, there's more residential demand, so, yes, we'll amend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| and we'll rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| I think, you know, there will be a lot of cases to come in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| over the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| You know, the housing market is really crazy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| The demand is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| One phrase I hear all the time right now is lot creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| You know, we need more lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| If you approved every low-density residential sector plan and then planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| residential at two to three, five, eight units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| it comes in front of you over the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| that's still not going to solve the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| That's still not going to make things more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| and get it back into whack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| But if you do that, at the same time, you are going to make the load| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| on the parks, schools, and roads more intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| And those are the questions that we really hope that you will ask during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| I think the sector plans, you know, they were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| They were, you know, when they were put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| even though they ranged from five to ten years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| but they still had a pretty good vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| They had at least a coordinated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| The Hardin Valley Northwest Sector Plan was only five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| It had really robust input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| You had the Transportation Mobility Plan for Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| which is only three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| And those give you good guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| So I'd really ask, you know, when you do a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| what's the justification and what's the impact here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Why, when we did something five years ago with a lot of community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| are we amending it, you know, right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| So that's our request that you really, in the next year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| lean into the land use designations in the current sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Wayne Doster is our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| And after that will be Jeremy McCord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| Hello. I am not Wayne Doster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| I'm Jill Herman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| I'm going to fill in his spot for him tonight, if that's okay with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| That's fine, officer, if you'll just state your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| All right. I'm Officer Jill Herman, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| I am a patrol officer for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| As you heard from my coworkers last week, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| they gave you a lot of statistics and breakdown of our wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| But I'm here because I want to share my experience and my story with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| But first I want to tell you a bit about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I'm a daughter to Stan and Tracy Herman, sister to Kevin Herman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| an aunt to the most perfect nephew, Rhett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| We all reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| I am single. I do have three dogs, Max, True, and a very active puppy named Dottie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| I take care of all my bills and mortgage on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| However, I could not have gotten what I have now without the help of my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| I'm 30 years old, and I'm still having to get favors from my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| Originally, when I was looking to buy my very first home, my loan amount was $105,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| So I don't know what really you could buy a livable place, especially right now, worth $105,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| But my parents, they helped me put a down payment for my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| I had a transmission go out on my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| They helped me put a down payment so I could afford a vehicle that I could drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| I can sustain what I have now as far as my mortgage, my new car, payment, all of that because I have to work side jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3673)|
| 1:01:23| I work side jobs constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| I work before and even after my nine-and-a-half-hour patrol shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| I work it on my four days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Sometimes I'll stack multiple side jobs on my days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Just so I know I can make it that month and not have to stress or ask for mom and dad's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| And I do all this without having a significant other or a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| And many of the people I work with have that, so I can't even imagine how many more side jobs they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| But I started with Knox County in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| I worked in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| I was fortunate to get selected for the academy in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Once I graduated, I went to the field officer training program and learned a lot from my FTOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| I worked patrol for a year-and-a-half and then actually left Knox County looking for a more higher-paying job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| I went to Clinton City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| After my two years with Clinton, I was looking again at other agencies that will offer more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| somewhere I could keep doing this profession I'm proud of, but something that will help me keep my head above water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3741)|
| 1:02:29| I came back to the sheriff's office because there's really not a place like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Our facilities, the people that we do have that have stayed here to train younger officers like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| there's just not a place like Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| And since I've been back, I've seen a lot of familiar faces, but I've also seen a lot of new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| I looked and I counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| From the 36 people that started in my academy in 2017, there's only 10 of us that still work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| The other ones have gone to the plants like ORNL or Y-12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| or have gone to other local agencies like Loudon or Oak Ridge just for better pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| Currently on my shift, I'd be considered one of the senior officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I have a total of five years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| I'd say there's about seven others or so that have at least 10 or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| and that's not accounting for my captain, lieutenant, and sergeants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| And my squad holds 23 patrolmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| Our agency has tried to keep up with training new officers, holding at least two academies a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| but unfortunately they can't keep up with the amount of great officers we continue to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| Our agency is understaffed in the jail on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| We were very thankful for our bonuses, the two bonuses, the $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| because that was that month I could actually spend more time with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| I didn't have to work extra or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| It does take a special kind of person to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| We encounter the public most often on their worst days where the call would be domestic-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| or suddenly losing a loved one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| We see a lot in our line of work that no one really should have to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| I'm here today just to speak for my fellow brothers and sisters in blue and ask for more pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| We need it. We deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| I'd love for our agency to keep and sustain the men and women that we do have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| and if we can't get the raise, you'll continue to see the higher turnover rate we're seeing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| If we have to call 911, I would want you all to have the faith that we will show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| If we can't keep up with the surrounding agencies and their raising their pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| I guarantee you that this department will only probably respond to highest-priority calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| But I do want to close and say I am proud, and we're all proud to serve you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| and I hope that you all appreciate us as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| and can find it that we do deserve more pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Thank you very much, Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Jeremy McCord is next, and followed by Becky Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3915)|
| 1:05:24| Welcome, sir. If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| You have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Jeremy McCord, Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3928)|

| 1:05:34| I'm also employed by the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I've been here since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| I'm going into my 15th year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I want to thank you all for the budget increases that the Sheriff's Office has seen over the previous years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| to previous cycles to where we can get more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| But I want to say from my point of view that I understand a lot of people from the Sheriff's Office are going to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| They're going to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| They're going to tell you their story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| And each and every story has its own individual merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| But at the end of the day, you all care about us as human beings and hearing our stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| But the caring stops when it's time to write the check, when it's time to look at the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| when it's time to ensure that if the sheriff brings forth information like was presented last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| well, he can move people wherever he needs to on this pay scale that was discussed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| Is that money going to be there next year and in the coming years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| The sheriff, through the budget process, can do a lot with his budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| but it does require a lot of cooperation and ensuring that that money is going to be there residually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| I understand that a lot of people do not want a tax increase, and as a homeowner, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| We're going into 22 years now with no property tax increases, and that is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| That's great for all of us and everybody in the community that owns a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| However, I would venture to say that our income revenue from tax assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| and getting all the revenue in is not keeping up with inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| A dollar in 1999, it takes $1.35 to $1.78, depending on what source, to equal a dollar in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4024)|
| 1:07:15| That's the world that we're living in, and what I look forward to is communication on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| and what's expected residually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| We've had a previous speaker that spoke that talked about what are we doing in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Are we going to have the money for the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Well, part of that infrastructure and these people coming in and moving into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| is a service that we're going to provide as an agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| I have no intentions of leaving. I've thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| I've thought long and hard about it because it would be bare financially for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| That's any job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Everybody sitting on this board has probably worked a job where they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| my pay is stagnant, I don't feel appreciated, and I'm going to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| And if you haven't, you know somebody that did, and you probably had those voices of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| and those conversations that are tough to have when it talks about employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| But what I'm telling you is the people that put the uniform on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| and I'm not in uniform, I'm a detective, I work in major crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| The people that do our job are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Fundamentally, it takes someone special that you can train that has something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| to give them what they need to go through that door when there's somebody on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| that nobody here or anywhere else is willing to go and confront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| It takes somebody special to have the training, education, and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| that we lose every time somebody walks out the door when they leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| because of something as mediocre as pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| This is one of the largest, greatest communities in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| and in my argument, the southeast, because we've got UT football right here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| We should not be having these discussions, but we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| And I know that previous administrations and administrators have begged you all for money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| and we show up and we have all these people in uniform, and it looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| But once again, we're having to take time away from our families over pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| And I ask and I beg and I implore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| They've asked for you all to go on ride-alongs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| and I'm going to be the guy that everybody says is crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| I don't want you to go because you don't know what it's like to sit in a red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| afraid somebody's going to walk up and blow your head off because of the vehicle that you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| I don't know what it's like to sit and go into a restaurant and have to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| because there's no seats that are safe for you because you're in uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| It's only a matter of time before the dangers you see on Fox News, CNN, or whatever you watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| they're going to come here to one of us, and we have to be vigilant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| We are going to be the ones responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Everybody can leave. I'm still going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And the pay scale that we are on is just a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| Look at it. You all were baffled by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| So I ask the commission for exercising of common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| a lot of human decency and respect when it comes to the job that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| and recognizing that there are people that are here that want to make a career here, that want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| If I could leave tomorrow and make four times my money, I would not go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| I've had opportunities, and I've passed them up because this is my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| This is what keeps my family safe by coming to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And I thank you for your time. My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4231)|

| 1:20:27| grandchildren, care for aging and ailing parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| and special needs children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| All of these things put stress on an already small budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| As I said, I'm currently assigned to K-9 training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| I love what I do, but our workload continues to rapidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| increase, just as it does at the Regional Training Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| From 1992 until I was selected in 2008 to be a handler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| there were only 49 handlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Just to put it in perspective, I have assisted in training 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| handlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Twenty-one of those are from Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| and that's just in four years, with three more to set at any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| If I just simply take a new dog to their initial vet appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| go downtown to get paperwork, get handler's course material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| together, or even daily maintenance and cleaning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| comes along with having 17 dogs in our facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| I am causing my co-trainer significantly additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| We struggle to keep up with our training of established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| handlers due to constantly training someone's replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| which takes ten weeks to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| You have been challenged to route patrol for one shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| and I second that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| I then would challenge you to put into perspective what a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| month's work would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I challenge you to do this because most people aren't aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| that our patrolmen work rotating shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| That includes day shift, evening shift, and night shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| During that time, I would challenge you to spend time with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| your significant other, take care of your animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| find time to do home maintenance, attend a worship service and any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| other meetings related to that, play with your children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| attend their extracurricular activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| help them with their homework and any assignments related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| your own ongoing investigation, and then work another part-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| job on top of that just to get the same experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| all while greeting the general public with a smile on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| If we are trying to retain knowledge, experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| and leadership, something has to change quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| By continuing just to raise the starting salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| it in no way benefits our senior officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| A good friend of mine started the same day that I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| He began his patrol career one year after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| He became an FTO, a field training officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| who trains the new patrolmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| In 2008, he trained 20 new officers from 2017 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Ten of those are still employed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| During that time, we had officers that he was training making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| nearly as much money as him with no experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| And what other job can someone start out consistently making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| as much as someone that has far more seniority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| This is what makes officers bitter, less likely to stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| and it causes resentment from senior officers to new recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| A fair comparison in our immediate area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| They have a PO program where officers can test every four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| years to receive a significant increase in their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| That's along with the 2.5% that they're guaranteed each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| When I started in 2003, I was a grade 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Eighteen years later, I'm only a grade 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| At step 14 out of 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| I know you were told in the last meeting employees could move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| multiple steps at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Even though that is possible, it's not common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| I'm eligible to retire in seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| and have 46 steps left to go to max out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| That's virtually impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| I would like to close by saying to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| you will not find a more dedicated and hard-working group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| of men and women that are employed at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| We all knew the job when we swore in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| We knew it wouldn't be an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| What we did not expect was for our salaries to stall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| I was reluctant to share my story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| but after coming to the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| I felt we had a commission who seemed to be willing to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| find a resolution to our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Lastly, I'd just like to say thank you for your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| and if you never had to make that phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| that last call, phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| or stood there as one was called out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| you can't possibly understand or call your wife and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| everything's fine, you're going to see something on the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| I was involved, but everything's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| I can't imagine what that's like on the other end of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5075)|
| 1:24:44| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| and you have five minutes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Keith Lyon, president of Fraternal Order of Police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Volunteer Lodge 2, and also Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| Last week, I spoke to you about the type of competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| that police recruiting is in nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| talked to you about who the winners are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Right now, it's the state of Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| and also who the losers are, which is the West Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| What I didn't talk to you about is the kind of competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| that goes on locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| It's not really Y-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Y-12 doesn't hire that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Now, when they do, they do take a significant chunk of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| but there's a competition that's been going on for well over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| 30 years, and it's with the sister agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Knox County Sheriff's Office historically has lost one, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| five employees every time the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| has a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Now, you take that over a 30-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| that's quite a bit of loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| And over 10 years, if you stop and think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| on an average of losing three employees to their academy of class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| at the end of those 10 years, that's over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| That's 30 officers you don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| It's usually more because there's a period of time where KPD will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| hire two classes at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| That's 30 officers that Knox County doesn't have that they should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| And if you go and ask all these people why they left from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| Knox County Sheriff's Office to the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| it doesn't have anything to do with training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Both training departments are excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| It doesn't have anything to do with opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| There's always time to do different jobs in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| One answer, paying benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Now, as an organization, if you can't help Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| compete with its sister agency, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| how are you going to compete with the surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5198)|

| 1:26:43| Keep in mind, an officer is one bullet away from losing his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| and one bad decision away from losing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| It's worth paying more for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| These guys, they stay committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5212)|

| 1:27:21| You would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5241)|

| 1:27:31| My name is Debbie Carter, and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| I'd like to thank the Mayor, County Commission, and County Finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| that has been listening to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| and continuing to work with the officers representing the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| I started at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| I'm one of the lowest-level entry positions assigned to support services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| as a records and warrants clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| I worked my way through corrections, working at the city jail, the penal farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| and what is now called the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| I was a member of Special Operations Response Team, the Honor Guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| the Dive Team, and Boat Patrol while I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| I've been through the Patrol Academy, worked on Baker Shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| worked on the Traffic Unit, became a canine handler with a bomb dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| a response member of the Hazardous Devices Bomb Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| I was a DARE officer in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| I taught our in-services and academy classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| and was an academy instructor and mentor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| I'm not telling you this to brag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| I'm telling you this because so many of our officers have this same and similar training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| which allows them to do CPR, to go running toward burning houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| to apply tourniquets when someone's losing their life, and so many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| I've seen them fix mailboxes, buy groceries, buy air conditioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| and so many other things that they do for the community that you never hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| I would like to emphasize that all of our concerns would be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| regardless of who was the sheriff at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| This has been an ongoing battle since I've been employed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| The officers do not want this to be a political matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| and this is strictly about officers' financial concerns and the officers' and public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| As a sheriff's office employee and the length of service I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| continued pay raises won't have a huge effect on my long-term career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| However, I am concerned about what the future holds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| for those that are willing to continue to serve and dedicate their lives for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| The new officers starting with us or the continued employment of our current officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| means a huge sacrifice to their own happiness and their families' futures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| I feel law enforcement should be evaluated separately from the regular county employees' outlook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| We are, again, in the process of undergoing another survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| to determine if KCSL employees are underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| Regular county employees rarely work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, holidays and weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| see death, destruction, abuse, and injury to our elderly, children, and animals that live in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| The officer does it over and over again, day after day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| Over the course of the years that I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| most if not all of the previous surveys have shown that we are moderately to grossly underpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| based on the size of our community, agency, and services we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| If we compare ourselves to KPD, which is our sister agency in our own county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| KPD currently on their website offers 7.5% salary increase for bachelor's degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| longevity pay increases after four years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| they have a senior officer plan that gets recognition by rank and pay after every additional four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| a pension after 25 years of service at age 56, and up to $3,000 a year in tuition reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| KCSL used to be an agency that always had a waiting list for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| It was a premier agency that everyone wanted to work at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| There are no longer lists and only small numbers of prospects that are quitting during training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| or taking our training and leaving to go to another better-paying, better-benefiting agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| We are wasting our money to train officers for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| I'm not sure if Commission is aware that all officers are single-person units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| and respond to most of their calls alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Some calls do require a two-person response due to the higher risk of the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| and some of those calls are starting to hold for a unit to free up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| for another officer to back up the one responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| If you were the person making the call for assistance during an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| because someone was breaking into your home and your child was home by themselves making that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| or you were involved in a domestic violence situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| you were calling for help because you were being beaten and you were injured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| and your partner wouldn't let you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| how would you feel about having to wait for an officer to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| And then you have to wait because EMS and fire won't go in until the officer clears the scene to make it safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| Governor Lee himself just approved a 37% pay increase for the Tennessee Department of Corrections employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| to help fill the gap and encourage employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| knowing the dangers of being underpaid and short-staffed in a setting where criminals are always present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| The overtime pay that we're currently being paid and offered by the commission is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| However, it's just a Band-Aid to fix the bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| KPD officers court an overtime pay as a regular benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Why are we not offering our county officers that permanent benefit as well to maybe help keep some of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| As newer and younger officers enter our workforce, they are more family-goal oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| have younger children, and are not willing to give the extra hours for the pay that they're currently receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| The average cost for a two-bedroom apartment in Knoxville is $1,100 to $2,000 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| with a waiting list for any place that would be desirable enough for a marked car to park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| and the officer to feel safe enough to leave his family at home by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| Officers are trying to combat those costs by taking courtesy officer positions, which reduce the cost of the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| That means once they go home, they're never off of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5539)|

| 1:33:12| This also concludes our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5592)|

| 1:33:23| It's a discussion item regarding the legislative delegation priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| As we discussed at the work session last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| we are scheduled for legislative breakfast with our legislative delegation on January 14th at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| That will be at the East Tennessee History Museum on Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| Commissioner Jay was kind enough to send me a reminder of last year's legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you had a handout that you just gave around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5630)|

| 1:34:13| county commissioners, and the county road superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| I thought you'd like to have the opportunity to at least look through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and see some of the initiatives that they're going to be embarking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| They get into, obviously, K-12 education, criminal justice, transportation infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| and then, of course, the share of funding and revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Then, it's kind of interesting, on the last page, they also included the item that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5678)|
| 1:34:49| well, I guess it's the third, let's see, well, first from the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| the sales tax administration fee that House of Representatives member Dave Wright is sponsoring in the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5694)|
| 1:35:02| and Senator Richard Briggs is sponsoring in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| Also, they're including the additional sales tax that could have an opportunity to increase local option sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5706)|
| 1:35:15| on purchases from $1,600 to $3,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| That's kind of a quick overview there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| Also, if you go to the Knoxville Chamber website, they have a legislative agenda for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| It's very interesting to read what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| One of those that we need to look at, I think, on a local level as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| is to advocate for a long-term solution to the growing congestion on I-40 and I-175 through Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5741)|
| 1:35:54| That's a lot of different opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| Of course, in our discussions, we can figure out how the best way to come up with a handful of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| that we want to talk to our legislators about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| Well, I thought I saw Representative Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| He's hiding in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| It could be the ghost of Christmas past, but I believe it's Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| Welcome, Representative. It's good to have you with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| Former commissioner, former chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| Commissioners, I think last year we had 10, if I'm counting them correctly, that we sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5786)|
| 1:36:36| Look, I'm open to suggestions as to how we want to come up with our items that we send to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| or rather the items that we want to ask our legislative delegation to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| I'll look to former chairman Jay if you want to speak to maybe last year's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| I think the way we did last year that I would suggest we reconstitute is open a forum discussion pretty immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5817)|
| 1:37:07| I would take last year's list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| I believe there was only one or two things from that list that were actually accomplished and should be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5829)|
| 1:37:17| I do think one or two things went through and then just see if there are other items that people either want to add to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5837)|
| 1:37:26| or reinforce that they remain on there as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| I know there's one particular bill I want to continue to work on that didn't make it through last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| but I think we'd just do basically a between now and the end of the calendar year open forum and debate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5855)|
| 1:37:44| the first week for you to take all those suggestions and solidify them into a final document and post before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5864)|
| 1:37:53| That sounds like a wonderful idea, and I'll do that actually tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| I'll open up a discussion in the commission forum, and commissioners can respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| and we'll create a list by the first week of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| In fact, I was just going to say if I come across something else, too, I'll submit it to Drew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| and then she can forward it to you all if I see something in between that time period as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| I know you probably have these notes, Commissioner Schoonmaker, on the 10 that we sent last year, which ones actually did get acted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| Yeah, I don't have that list in front of me, but I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| If you could maybe update the commission on which ones did go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| I see Jane is in the audience, and we did want to talk about the February commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| Commissioners, as we talked about last week, our February work session was scheduled for February 22nd because the 21st is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5926)|
| 1:38:57| We found that this room was not available that day or really the rest of that week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| and so we moved the work session to the previous week on Tuesday, which is February 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| It has come to my attention from some fellow commissioners that our regular commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| which is scheduled for February 28th, falls on county government days on the Hill in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5953)|
| 1:39:23| And so I have spoken with or Drew has spoken with PBA and scheduling of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5963)|
| 1:39:32| and the previous Thursday was looked at as a potential date of moving our meeting so that commissioners can attend county government day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5972)|
| 1:39:42| This room is not currently available on that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| I believe it is the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| Transportation Authority is meeting in this room on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| Jane, if you would, I want to put you on the spot and let you come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| I just want you to get the opportunity to clear up any misunderstanding commissioners might have when it comes to scheduling and priorities and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6000)|
| 1:40:09| Certainly. I'm Jane Barrett, and I'm the CEO of the Public Building Authority, 400 Main in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| We scheduled this room at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Everybody sends in their requests at the end of the year, and we have about 20 entities that use this main assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| And so we had we always put city council county commission school board still has a few of their meetings here until their new facility is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6025)|
| 1:40:34| But those come first and then all others fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| So when we got confirmation that everyone was OK with the date, we moved forward with scheduling the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| So it is the Federal Transportation Authority, and they do have a public forum here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| And so they need a room that's secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| And they do have a group of 15 that would be present for speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| So that's our challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| We want to honor kind of the hierarchy of how we do this, but we do have to displace other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| So I think it was just brought to attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| And I talked to Commissioner Beeler about that as to what once you to review it and see what you want, because it is it will be an issue to reschedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6067)|
| 1:41:16| We've already talked to them, and they said they could not reschedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| So just so everybody knows where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| Thank you very much, Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| So, look, this was my position is I wanted to bring it to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| I don't want to autocratically say, OK, we're going to reschedule our meeting because somebody wants to go to kind of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| I want to know what the pleasure of the body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Obviously, this body does take a certain amount of priority when it comes to the scheduling of this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| And if need be, I'm sure things could be rearranged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| But I want that to be the pleasure of the body before I take any action in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| So I'm just going to look around and see what my fellow commissioners think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Just to be clear, we are now scheduled for a workshop on the 15th and a commission meeting on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6134)|
| 1:42:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| And we moved off of the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Because this room was not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| And rather than move to the small assembly, we felt this body needed to meet in this room, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| And so the 15th was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| And now I'm hearing you say that the 28th is the day on the Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| Which is a bit unusual for it to be on a Monday, if I recall, or at least last Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6174)|
| 1:43:03| So the 22nd, theoretically, is still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| It's just that the room is not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| The date would be available if we wanted to move everything forward a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| But we'd have to have the regular commission meeting in the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| I don't think that would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I know we meet the second and third a couple months of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| But I think we also need to bear in mind our commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| deal with zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| And we need to make sure we don't do anything that gets that schedule off from NOC's planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6214)|
| 1:43:43| Well said. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| So whenever we set our times, we also have to correlate with other agencies, like Commissioner Smith was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| So is it uncommon for us to meet the second and third, like you were actually just talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6236)|
| 1:44:03| But would anybody have any bones about backing up a week and going in the second week for workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| and coming out the third week for the actual commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| It says right here, Board of Education, from 3 to 5 on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6257)|
| 1:44:23| So that's probably not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| I'm looking through the times, and the one time that really sticks out to me is planning commission is going to be on that Thursday, the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| Would anybody have any bones about meeting on a Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Could you even do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| And then meet five days later for our actual commission meeting on the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| Or is that too soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| Would that work for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| Would they be able to get things turned around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| Yeah, they're a month behind, so we would be receiving a January agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Jay before we go any further with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| Right now the 15th was the workshop date, and the 22nd, I don't see why one month we can't meet at the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6305)|
| 1:45:14| We can still do the people's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| We've met as full committees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| It's unusual, but most of our meetings are not 60, 80 people in the gallery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| So I think for one month, if we're going to sort of keep a more regularity of the county business, I'd just assume meeting in the other room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6325)|
| 1:45:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| Commissioner, is that your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Okay, Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Just a clarification, you're saying then meeting on the 22nd in the small assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| And then the only thing that I understand, if we did do that, is then city council would be live on community TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6346)|
| 1:45:57| Ours would be recorded for playback later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| They can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| It's my understanding that community TV cannot do a dual broadcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| There go the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| I would personally vote for the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| I won't be here the week of the 7th or the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| I already made plans, but I would prefer the 22nd, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| I would just say I agree that the room is not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| We would prefer to meet in here, but I would lean toward meeting on the 22nd in the small assembly versus moving all the way up to February 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6392)|
| 1:46:42| just because that's just a really, really quick turnaround from our January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| You're not available the early week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| And I would remind my colleagues, too, that we did some of the most important business that this commission will ever do in the small assembly room with three districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6414)|
| 1:47:05| Commissioner Skinnecker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| And then just to clarify, with PBA, the information you gave us, there is nothing then on the 22nd in the small assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6426)|
| 1:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| She's saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Yes, we could also ask, with enough advance notice, I'm sure we could ask the Knox County IT team to also do one of their live feeds like they did on the Knox County website when we were on a remote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6437)|
| 1:47:29| and they were able to sort of put a particular feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| If CTV was delayed on recording, I'm sure Knox County IT would be able to help us stream it live just for that extra transparency and access to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6452)|
| 1:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Seeing no other lights, I believe I gather that it is the pleasure of the body that our work session will be on February 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| and our commission meeting will be on February 22nd in the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| We will schedule accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Did you want me to just brief them on what happened last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Commissioner Skinnecker, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| And Commissioner Busser, I'll recognize you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Last Thursday, I had the opportunity to attend a briefing with the Department of Education about the BEP funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| and Mayor Glenn Jacobs was present representing Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| and, of course, Bob Thomas and Ron McPherson were there and Christy Christie representing Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| It was interesting in their proposal presentation that they basically said that they wanted to revise the BEP formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6515)|
| 1:48:48| and what they were planning on doing was they didn't speak of any dollar amounts of how to increase what the BEP funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6528)|
| 1:48:57| or how much the state is going to be kicking in going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| but what they did say was that they were going to eliminate these certain grants, like if there's a grant for security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| what they're going to do is take those dollars and put it back into your designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| as long as you follow what their guidelines are to be able to make those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| They also wanted to move forward with a principal in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| However, they did not say that they would pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| They kept talking about a 12-month process that they wanted to get all this input from citizens, teachers, school administrators, public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6569)|
| 1:49:43| get all the stakeholders and have the opportunity to get all this information together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| but they never would go back to say, hey, how much we're going to increase the funding if we're going to change the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6589)|
| 1:49:58| So I kept sitting there thinking that the Department of Education just cannot come out and say they're going to change the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6598)|
| 1:50:10| It has to go to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| So trying to put two and two together, that if they're going to wait 12 months to complete this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| that means that the earliest they can do to present it to the General Assembly is January 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6620)|
| 1:50:29| So after the meeting concluded, the Deputy Commissioner of Operations, Mr. Sam Percy, came up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6629)|
| 1:50:37| He goes, hey, Knox County, we're glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| The good thing was there was a good representation from all over East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| from not only the county school systems but also the city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| So I said to Mr. Percy, I said, now, let me just make sure I'm understanding this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| that the Department of Education is not going to do anything until after August of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6653)|
| 1:51:03| after the General Assembly retires for this session, you're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| And he looked at me and goes, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| We're going to have the General Assembly make a decision before they leave at the end of August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| on what the BEP funding mechanism is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| And so I'm kind of taken back a little bit because I'm like, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| you just sat here for two hours and kept talking about a 12-month timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| You never said that the financial component was going to be decided by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| I said, you guys haven't even filed a bill yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| So this is apparently going to be something that's fast-tracked through the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| from the governor's office to try to get some new formula in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| So I find it interesting that one of the largest components of the state of Tennessee's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6712)|
| 1:52:03| which hasn't been changed in 30 years, is going to have this monumental change here in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6723)|
| 1:52:10| So my friends in the General Assembly, I really think they're going to be burning the midnight oil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6730)|
| 1:52:18| because they probably don't even know what's coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| But I kind of felt like that they should have told us up front, you know, here's the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| But when you keep saying 12 months, we're going to do all this, and we're going to reach out to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| get all this input, and you can go online, fill out surveys and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| So get ready because the legislature is either going to vote it up, vote it down, how to fund it, how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6760)|
| 1:52:51| It's going to be a very interesting time the first spring of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| And they don't tell you any of the numbers, which frustrated a lot of the smaller school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6777)|
| 1:53:07| because they're like, well, wait a minute, are you going to fund nurses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Are you going to fund mental health workers? Are you going to fund psychiatrists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| And then you want a principal in every school, but you're not saying who's going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6795)|
| 1:53:22| So it'll be a fun time, Mr. Wright. You can look forward to in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6802)|
| 1:53:29| He looks ready for it to me. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair. If we're going to change this in February, I understand we're going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| We need to start really letting the public know about it because we've had people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| even when we're doing the beer board, we've let people know and they didn't show up one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6827)|
| 1:53:56| So what I'm saying is we just really need to put that out to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| so they won't come here expecting to see a meeting when we're not having it the regular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Thank you. Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Any other business come before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| Entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Motion to second. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| We're adjourned. Zoning will begin at 7.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-business?start=6857)|
