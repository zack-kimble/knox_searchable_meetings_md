| 2:32:04| Council. I'm Kathy Mack, and I'm the Community Engagement Manager for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| And first and foremost, I am here as a voice for our young people. Our Empower Knox initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9129)|
| 2:32:16| we have partnered with several different members and organizations in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| to help come up with some unusual, unorthodox opportunities for our young people to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9140)|
| 2:32:25| successful life outcomes. And one of the things that we really have kind of pivoted with and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| a focus on is hearing the voices of our young people. Like our young people are speaking out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| they want to be heard, they want to be recognized, they want to have a voice in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9156)|
| 2:32:42| Our community is hurting, our young people are hurting, and one of the things that we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| is create a platform. So with our youth forum and our youth council that's coming, we're getting our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9166)|
| 2:32:53| young people together. We're getting them engaged in other things that's happening in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| to where they can have a voice to what's going on in their community. We're excited not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9177)|
| 2:33:04| with this partnership with Cities United and with our youth forum, but what we've been able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| with the Mayor's Community Empowerment Roundtable, the funding that we provided for a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| grassroots organizations who are doing the on-the-ground work, who you normally wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| see, but they're doing the work. They want to see their community be healthy and safe, and we back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| that. We back our young people, and we're going to see some actionable wins. We're committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9203)|
| 2:33:28| and we're going to be intentional about this work. Thank you, Ms. Mack. Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9208)|
| 2:33:36| did you have a follow-up question? Yeah, I just had a follow-up. If you all have a breakdown of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| the numbers, we've seen an increase in gun violence, but I haven't heard any demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9222)|
| 2:33:52| details regarding, you know, the victims, any perpetrators that we're aware of. We know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9232)|
| 2:34:00| the reports are coming from all over the city, but do we know, do we have a sense of the demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9240)|
| 2:34:08| of the victims? Unless Chief Miller or Chief Thomas have that handy, you can share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| Otherwise, we can provide that to Council by email tomorrow. I don't know if we have that off the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| of our heads. Chief Thomas? Yeah, I don't have that right off the top of my head, but I can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| that together. Are you talking about over the past year or just since January 1st, or what specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| would you like? Since January 1st would be helpful, because I know that's one number that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| shared a lot of, I think, what, three in January last year and 14 this year. Yeah, it's a lot higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9278)|
| 2:34:49| So, okay, we'll get that to you. We'll get that to you by email tomorrow. Unless, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9289)|
| 2:34:54| Chief Thomas, why don't you give her a chance to look it up? If she finds it while we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| conversing, we'll report back. I can get it in two minutes, so. Okay. If it's okay, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9297)|
| 2:35:05| Parker, I'll go to another question, and then we'll come back to answer that one. Yeah, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9305)|
| 2:35:09| Council Member Singh. Thank you, Mayor. Some of the last bit of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9309)|
| 2:35:16| really irritates me. It feels like, at times, there's this dog and pony show of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9316)|
| 2:35:23| do not work and have not worked, and we keep insisting that they are. I'd like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| Empower Knox and Save Our Sons, I haven't, let me come back. With Empower Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| what are some of the grants that have been given to the people who are doing this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| Kathy Knox, do you have the answers? There's one on the agenda. The very next item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| is an example of a community empowerment grant to do Safe Haven gym program, Love Your Neighbor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9346)|
| 2:35:54| So, that's one example. Charles Lomax is on the call, if you want to speak to that, and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9354)|
| 2:36:02| provide more, you know, if you want to give a general overview, and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9362)|
| 2:36:09| we can provide more specific details of every single grant by email tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| But just in general would be nice. Okay. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mayor. Charles Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| Director of Community Empowerment, City of Knoxville, City-County Building. With the Empower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9380)|
| 2:36:26| Knox initiative, it really is continuing the work and picking up where Save Our Sons left off. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9386)|
| 2:36:32| have approximately $100,000 of discretionary funding that we're able to utilize in giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9392)|
| 2:36:40| grants to a number of community organizations that are requesting funding. And so, as Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| mentioned, there is one on this agenda, and to date, we have given approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9405)|
| 2:36:52| around $75,000 to community organizations that this body has approved throughout the last fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9412)|
| 2:37:01| year. And so, I don't have that list in front of me of what those organizations are, but that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| something that we can get to Council and that we can share with you, along with the funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| that. With those funds that are given, we do follow up with those organizations, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| reviews that are done to see how those funds are being utilized and how the productivity of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9438)|
| 2:37:24| work is being done. And I just want to commend the work that Kathy has done coming in. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| done an excellent job. And we are talking with those organizations that are on the ground. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| in conversation with our young people as well. We've held two youth forums just within the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9456)|
| 2:37:42| month, where we are getting ready and preparing to launch our Youth Council, where our young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| are going to be helping to give voice and to shape some of the ideas that are needed from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| perspective, as well as helping us to understand from a policy perspective some of the initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9475)|
| 2:38:01| and things that they feel would be beneficial in their community from their eyes. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9481)|
| 2:38:07| that's, again, a work that we're continuing to do. And those are funds that we have given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9487)|
| 2:38:15| throughout the year to primarily youth-serving organizations that are on the ground, that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9495)|
| 2:38:23| working hands-on with our children. I'll just add. Thank you, Dr. Lomax. I'll just add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9503)|
| 2:38:31| Council Member Singh, that in addition to the Community Empowerment Grants, Community Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| Grants is a bigger fund of money that is part of the annual budget every year that goes to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9515)|
| 2:38:42| all kinds of youth-serving organizations, the Shore Foundation, Unique Academy, Girl Talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| YWCA, Emerald Youth, Boys and Girls Club. I can't think of all of them off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9529)|
| 2:38:55| but those are all organizations that are working every day on what I would call the root causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9535)|
| 2:39:01| and trying to give kids a safe place to be, give kids access to educational opportunities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| tutoring and that sort of thing. What's new about this budget amendment has not been done in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9546)|
| 2:39:14| formal way in the City of Knoxville with city funds is the violence interruption stuff. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9554)|
| 2:39:20| I'm committed to doing that in an evidence-based, community-informed manner, using the talents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9560)|
| 2:39:27| connections and credibility of people who are working in the community, but giving them training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| and resources so they do it in a way that we can make sure it's happening at 2 a.m. on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9572)|
| 2:39:40| night so that they're paid and that they say, okay, there's just been a serious shooting. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| family member of this young man and his friends and family are really upset and they want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| seek revenge. So that way, we want to support programs where people know how to intervene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| and deescalate and prevent that retaliation from happening. That's the one way. That's one way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9599)|
| 2:40:07| think about it. But we need to make sure that there's not just one person. People are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| that in an ad hoc manner. Lawrence Williams is just one person who sometimes will find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9613)|
| 2:40:20| about a crime and go down there and try to talk people down. And he does that out of the goodness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| of his heart because of his own experiences going from issues, challenge times to now being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9625)|
| 2:40:33| minister and someone who helps support our youth. But he's just one person. There are other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| who have that capacity or are doing it more informally. And that's what this budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| is, to make that something that we support and that we give them the resources and that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| rely on it on an everyday, 24-7 basis to stop those retaliations, to prevent killings and shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| in the first place. So I know that what we're looking at moving forward, I feel like it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9653)|
| 2:41:02| in the right direction. But it can't follow the same model that we've been following. How much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| money are we paying someone to distribute $100,000? About twice as much as that. That money should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9667)|
| 2:41:16| going to the people doing this. $4,800 to help Lawrence do the work that he's been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| is not enough. And the reason that people do it here and there or are ad hoc or not professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| is because there's not money to give them to do this work. So I'm looking forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| seeing what we do with this million dollars. I know that some of it's going to go with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| contract with Cities United. And I like how they look at the whole picture. They have a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9700)|
| 2:41:47| They have a plan. And then we move forward. And as Anthony Smith, I believe his name was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| mentioned, it also includes community. But how much of this money? A lot of people have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9712)|
| 2:41:59| risking their lives and doing this work already. I understand that there's accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9719)|
| 2:42:07| We need to know that people are doing what they're saying. You know, there are all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| rules and the regulations that we have to use and do because we're a city. But we cannot follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9733)|
| 2:42:20| what we've been doing with Save Our Sons and with Empower Knox. That's the most ridiculous thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| I have ever heard. Those programs that have been funded, I don't... That's all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9746)|
| 2:42:34| Thank you, Councilmember Steele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9754)|
| 2:42:35| Thank you. And I think our intention is that we have to make this work. So we look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| sharing with you and the rest of council the specific programs and the data to back them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9761)|
| 2:42:47| so that we can make sure that it is making a difference for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| I look forward to that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| Does Chief Thomas have the answer to about the race and the geographic location or age? I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9779)|
| 2:43:06| know. The demographics of the victims of homicides in 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| Right. So I do, Mayor. Thank you. As far as the victims, we have seven that were Black males.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9790)|
| 2:43:17| They're anywhere in age from 15 to 64. Three 20s, two in their teens, two in their 20s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9797)|

| 2:44:08| Thank you, Chief Thomas. And, you know, I wanted to clarify why I asked that question. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9848)|
| 2:44:16| important when we are beginning these new initiatives that we discuss why we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9856)|
| 2:44:23| certain moves, why we want to have a partnership with Cities United. Oftentimes it's what we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9863)|
| 2:44:34| say that can create misunderstandings in our community about how this violence is impacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9874)|
| 2:44:46| our community. It's why, you know, many at Austin East feel a bit protective of their school right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9886)|
| 2:44:54| now because there's so much attention coming to their school when no violence actually happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| inside of their school. When there are other schools in our community that are receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| threats. I just want us to make sure that we're creating policy based on data that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| and not just assumptions that we're making about where there is a problem with violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9910)|
| 2:45:17| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker. Any other questions or comments from Council? Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9917)|
| 2:45:23| did you have a brief comment you wanted to add? I do. I just want to, just to Councilmember Parker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| a conversation with the Chief, I do think you would want to do a historical look at that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| Councilmember, just to your point to make sure that we're putting the resources and the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| to the right target and to the right places. So I think that's a fair question. And the strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| that we're talking about are not just impactful for the 14 to 24-year-olds who we focus on across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9943)|
| 2:45:49| the country, but it would also help with whoever is in those cycle of violence. But I do think your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| point around the data, looking at a historical going about five to 10 years back and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9954)|
| 2:45:59| where have we historically seen violence happen in Knoxville? And the trend would probably be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| same as it is right now. But it's just really good to have that data so that you spend your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| time and resources and energy in the right places. So I appreciate that question. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9968)|

| 2:48:26| have up to five minutes. My name is Aloysius Gregory and I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10106)|
| 2:48:34| And I kind of want to go over three things that I feel like I see in the city that I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10114)|
| 2:48:41| First of all, the homeless is staggering. It's 7,467 homeless people that live in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10121)|
| 2:48:51| 558 of those are families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| 679 of those are military veterans. So I'm concerned about, you know, these are unsheltered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10135)|
| 2:49:06| people. Some of them because we don't have enough shelters to go around. In turn, that creates a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10146)|
| 2:49:13| problem for businesses. That also creates a problem for loitering and littering, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10153)|
| 2:49:22| we also have a trash issue. On the east side, I can't go anywhere without seeing at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10162)|
| 2:49:31| I mean, goodness, I could fill up a trash bag walking a block, and I have done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| So, you know, one thing creates another. So I think we need to come up with a better plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10177)|
| 2:49:45| for the homeless that we have. 1,133 are chronically homeless. That means all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10185)|
| 2:49:53| time they have nowhere to go. These people have no home, no anything. There's no way that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10193)|
| 2:49:59| can contribute to society because there's nothing for them. I mean, what are they doing? They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| going to the homeless shelters. They have to leave by 7 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| And then there's no, they have no direction from that point on. Some of them have mental illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10209)|
| 2:50:14| You know, are we reaching them? You know, are there programs for them? I mean, I've heard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| some and seen some, but they're not very productive. Another issue that I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10219)|
| 2:50:27| is the litter. Like I said, the trash is overwhelming. A lot of the times, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10227)|
| 2:50:34| and I'm not trying to be funny here, but if I go out west, you don't see trash build up as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| as you would on the east side. The businesses around there, they go and they clean up around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| their areas. And I think that as a community, we need to step up. We're the volunteer state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10245)|
| 2:50:52| for a reason. We volunteered 1,500 soldiers for a war that we believed in. So I'm sure we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10252)|
| 2:50:59| volunteer and step up and do what we need to do as a community. And the other thing that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10259)|
| 2:51:04| like is the most important, which is the violence that I've seen. The violence in our city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| grown. Knoxville is 3.7% national, above the national rate. I've myself had a personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10270)|
| 2:51:21| experience with violence. And I think that it's just ridiculous that we have to lose our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10281)|
| 2:51:26| and we have to worry about that on a daily basis. A lot of the violence that happens in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10286)|
| 2:51:35| it's like, let's see, Fort Sanders population, that area is 60% more violent than Beaumont is 58%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10295)|
| 2:51:45| You know, this is according to Tennessee government's list of the most violent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10305)|
| 2:51:53| the most areas, the neighborhoods that get the most violence. So when we do do the police funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| or whatever it is that we're doing, I just hope that we keep in mind and reach out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| communities and build that relationship because trust goes a long way. And we do have people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10323)|
| 2:52:10| here like myself that are working and trying to build our community. And we don't want any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| deaths. We don't want any more garbage. We don't want any more poverty. We want to excel as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10337)|
| 2:52:24| community. I know that there was a prison reform that was approved. And I did research on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10344)|
| 2:52:31| just because it concerns me because most prison reform programs can work, but most of them don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10351)|
| 2:52:39| because most people are repeat offenders. They don't find employment. And with the rate of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10359)|
| 2:52:47| crime rate is right now, the way that it's going, how is that going to help us? Do we have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10367)|
| 2:52:53| set in motion for this as well? Because if not, when you get out of prison, you're coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10373)|
| 2:53:00| And if you're going to be a repeat offender and there's nobody that's going to hire them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10380)|
| 2:53:05| if they're, you know what I mean, if they get out and they want to change their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| and they keep getting let down, and they're around this and they're around that, then that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| just, I think an accident waiting to happen. So I hope all these things have been thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10392)|
| 2:53:17| because, you know, we as a society, especially on the East side, we're not trying to lose nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10397)|
| 2:53:22| else. We're not trying to live like this. And we definitely don't want to have to fight our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| city. You know, we want to feel safe with the police. We don't want to feel like they're our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10407)|

| 2:54:15| Most certainly. My name is Sydney Clinkscales, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914. I've listened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10455)|

| 2:54:31| and other things discouraging. For one, I'll go ahead and get the discouraging things out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| way. Councilman Singh was right. We have to know, we have to discard the things that did not or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10477)|
| 2:54:43| not worked before. We cannot continue to go down the same path. It's disingenuous to believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| you can do so and be successful. Again, doing the wrong things. In specific, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10489)|
| 2:54:58| the hospital-based intervention, that's nice. The street outreach workers, okay, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10498)|

| 2:55:43| who lived in East Knoxville, this goes back not just five years, 10 years, 20 years. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| talking about the same things over again. So we can't waste time on information like that. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10548)|
| 2:55:56| again, real quickly, 76.9% of the murders have taken place in what's considered, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10556)|
| 2:56:02| East Knoxville, the bad rep that has gotten called the guns on X, Y, Z. And 69.2% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10562)|
| 2:56:10| murders are Black people. So that's all the information you need. And you can match that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| and run that back years. Again, we have to go about doing things new. I listen, the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10576)|
| 2:56:24| are on ground, they need greater funding. They need more expansion. Honestly, again, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10584)|
| 2:56:30| with Cities United, what their model is. Again, I understand it. However, we already have a Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10590)|
| 2:56:36| United already here in Knoxville. We just need networking. It doesn't need outsourcing. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10596)|
| 2:56:40| wasted money. I agree on that. One thing, again, when you're addressing the broad picture, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10600)|
| 2:56:48| again, it was brought up briefly by Mr. Smith, but you have to address jobs. You have to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10608)|
| 2:56:53| address the wealth disparity. Because again, you can go back into the beginnings of time. The poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10613)|
| 2:56:58| communities, that's where the violence happens. We don't need another study for that. We got 7,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| years of recorded human history that says that. We don't need another study. Personally, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10623)|
| 2:57:10| don't employ these kids or get them opportunities, I ran a program. You can go back in 1984, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10630)|
| 2:57:16| called it the NYC program. I went from housing project to housing project with a stick in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10636)|
| 2:57:21| bucket, cleaned up my very own community, paid me minimum wage. In 1999, I worked that program as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10641)|
| 2:57:28| one of the counselors. In 2009, I personally called over 900 children myself, got them galvanized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10648)|
| 2:57:35| got them tested, got them assessed, got them placed in jobs in city governments. We had them in day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10655)|
| 2:57:41| care centers. We had them in theaters. You name it, we had kids there. And not just run that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10661)|
| 2:57:48| not just for a year, but to continue to fund that program year out. It can be done. It can be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| together. Me personally, like I said, I called over 900 children myself, got over 63 contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10674)|
| 2:57:59| signed, again, with these particular agencies. So if you do not address the problem of giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10679)|
| 2:58:04| something to do, making money, because again, that's the problem. Again, these children are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| broke. If 42 percent of the working class people, and again, that's not just 42 percent of unemployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| that's 42 percent of the working class people in this particular community live below poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10694)|
| 2:58:19| what about the children? They have absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. So again, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10699)|
| 2:58:26| understand. Thank you. I understand that things, you know, in the community are where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10706)|
| 2:58:33| but again, you have a unique opportunity. And I said it before and I'll say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| this is simply about political will for you guys on your end to allocate greater funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10716)|
| 2:58:42| to the programs, utilize what's already on the ground. Again, not to burn nobody's hustle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| however, we already have the network here in Knoxville, Tennessee. We already know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| issues are. We don't need another study. We need to throw out what does not work and go what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| do know what works. Stan Johnson, my neighbor, a college friend, his greatest quote, it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10738)|
| 2:59:05| nothing beats a bullet. What stops a bullet, I'm paraphrasing, is a job. So again, thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10745)|
| 2:59:11| much for your time. I yield my remaining five seconds. Thank you, Mr. Clinkscale. Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10751)|
| 2:59:19| as to my knowledge, no one else has signed up for public forum. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| Yes, ma'am, that's right. Okay. Council members, public forum's over. This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=10764)|
