| 0:05:32| They have told her, I assume they have gone back out and re-inspected or re-tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| And basically for an overview, this is a venue for events, weddings typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=338)|

| 0:05:58| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| The reason they are getting a beer permit is just for certain events on site that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| might want to sell beer, but they will sell it only to people over 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=365)|

| 0:06:36| in accordance with guidelines given to them by the ABC since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| I think since the citation, but we have been following the ABC's guidelines for operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| of Hunter Valley Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| So Wolfie, have we done anything else out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Do we have a good feeling that they understand the error of their ways and were, alleged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=420)|
| 0:07:11| ways, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| They do not have a license, so they cannot serve alcohol until they get a license from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Arthur, what, as you say it is on site, why do we have an on-off premise now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| I know you want to take the beer truck around, but I think that is a totally different...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| No, no, we are just, we are asking that the off-site be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| It will only be for on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| So we will need to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Who made the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| I think last...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Or was it amended on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| It was amended last month, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| It was amended last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| It was deferred from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| And Mr. Seymour was here and asked that it be changed at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Well, the application we have printed out is off and on, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| That is the original application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| So it is on-premise only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| I think, Sam, I think we talked about the beer truck being volleyed around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| I think that was kind of something we had an issue with, so I think that is one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Commissioner Brown, did...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=498)|

| 0:08:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Arthur, the only...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| You know, the thing that really disturbed me before was the fact when the Alcohol Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| was there, they seemed to indicate they were told that they had no jurisdiction to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| or why are they there or they shouldn't be there or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| I just want to make sure that we understand that if authorities come onto the site with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| any questions or to check on any credentials or whatever, they have full authority and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| everybody needs to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| I think we do, and we ended up...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| My last meeting with the ABC was on a very friendly note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| We sort of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| They said what they needed, and I said, fine, and I don't know whether they've been back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| out there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Whether they have or not, we do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| We have heard nothing further from them after our last conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Usually, they'll come back out after an enforcement action at some point to check further, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| they may not have done that here, but I assume they have been back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Ms. Barger, you have been here before, and I believe that has been duly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| We also see that you have nothing holding this up, and it will be passed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| We admonish you not to be here in front of us in the future, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=592)|

| 0:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I'm going to ask the staff some questions now at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Pending acquiring a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=952)|

| 0:15:57| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I make a motion that this application be approved pending the findings of the Fire Marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| for a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| And also the surrender of the existing license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| The motion is properly before us and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Seeing no lights or further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=983)|

| 0:16:31| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| If there be no further business, come for the Knox County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| Stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Thank you, commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| We will have two types of public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| We will have four, I think, public forum items that are now unrelated to the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| All of the other public forum will be at the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| The first person on public forum this evening is Commissioner Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I just wanted to let you guys know what was placed on your desk before you from a local mom-and-pop young couple bakery called Sugar Mama's Bakery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1037)|
| 0:17:29| This was brought to you by my wife and my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| So enjoy the fudge cream and the chocolate chip cookie, and thank you for letting me have this few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| The comment that was made earlier was about the daughter that we were campaigning before she existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| So she's growing like a really good little weed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| You're growing weed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Yes, that's a good thing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Growing weed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| The next person on, I guess the reason he said that is because we just got off beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| and we've never got a good cold beer on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| So now maybe we're going on to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| The next person on public forum is Ms. Lisa Blair Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1101)|
| 0:18:42| Ms. Rogers, your name and address, and you have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| My name is Lisa Blair Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| My address is 6311 Wild Oak Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| And I am here tonight to ask the county commission to consider an ordinance against firearm discharge in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1132)|
| 0:19:02| I don't think there is one currently, unless I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| And I'm here on a personal consideration because my family has a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| who currently likes to shoot his gun in his front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| and it's a concern for me and my family and my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| So I don't know where I need to go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| I'm looking for guidance from you as far as what do you need from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Do you need some sort of suggestion or what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Thank you, Ms. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Ms. Blair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| There is an ordinance in the county on proper usage of firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| You can contact the sheriff's department and get a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| And my suggestion to you would be anything that violates what is in the set of rules that you get from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1194)|
| 0:20:03| should be reported to the sheriff's department if you're in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| If you're in the city, I'm not sure how far out Wild Oak Drive is, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| It's a street over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| When I contacted the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| they told me so long as he was not pointing the gun at me or my house that he was allowed to do what he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Well, there are certain rules, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| I mean, they have to have proper backstops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| They have to have this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| So you need to get a copy of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| And then if it's not what I consider safe, then what do I do to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| Report it back to the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| They can investigate, and if there's a violation of it, it'll be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| I assume there's no violation of it at this point, or the sheriff's department would have told me so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| So what do I do as far as the county commission is concerned getting a new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| that is better for this day and time and isn't just considering forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| Because in the county now, there's all kinds of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| I mean, it's more densely populated than it probably was when these other ordinances were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| So I'm here to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| If a county commissioner chooses to take that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| and bring some suggestions or off-changes to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| then it could be discussed and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| That would be the proper channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| So I need to go through my county commissioner, and then she would present it to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| No, we could call him Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| Thanks, Lisa, for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| I was hoping that you would just kind of tell them your story of what had happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and made you uncomfortable about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| We've had this issue come before us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| and the law director has given us the opinion that really there's nothing much that we can do here at the county level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1313)|
| 0:22:02| that this is more of a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| But it's something that I think we need to be discussing because, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| the county is much more settled and housing is much more dense now than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| And it may be time for the state to take a look again at what the state law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| and maybe strengthen those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| And that's something where the commission could assist you in contacting the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| And we can certainly get together and discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| But it's something that I think all of us need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| And, as I said, this is not the first time it's come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| And, Bud, would you like to jump in and just kind of say about what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| give us the same information that you gave us the last time this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| which I think was within the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| The issue we really have, and it's good you can bring it to the attention of your commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| but this is a second amendment and a Tennessee constitutional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| And so to deal with the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| it would take a state legislature and an act of the legislature to put this before the people for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| Currently under the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| the only thing that even the legislature has to regulate is the right to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| Nothing else is covered and gives even the legislature the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| because the people have prohibited it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| The other thing that you can do and what we're talking about when you call the sheriff's department to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| is the potential of what they call, is this behavior resulting in reckless endangerment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| Then, you know, JJ's officers and so forth will look, they'll gather the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and if it's true, they can take action on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| But beyond that, at the county level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| there's really not much, if anything, that the county can do about firearms at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| because we, the county, are only allowed to regulate one element of firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| that the state legislature has allowed us, and that is either to carry or not carry in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| Otherwise, this body has no jurisdiction over firearms at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| It's a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| But we can certainly help you, we can certainly be a go-between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| and help you make the connections that you need to with the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and offer some guidance and some support there in terms of contacting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| and interacting with them and letting them know the situation that you've experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| and hopefully encouraging them to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| So thank you for coming today and for letting us know what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you, Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| Next public forum speaker is Clerk of Courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| former chair of Knox County Commission, former chair of Knox County Commission, Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you, commissioners, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Jolie, am I hooked in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1509)|
| 0:25:18| I have some numbers I want to give to you, and I think you're going to like what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1518)|
| 0:25:26| I'm hooked in down here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1526)|
| 0:25:35| Well, I went through dress rehearsal today and it worked, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Can we bring it up to you, Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Well, I have my clicker here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1544)|
| 0:25:57| I apologize, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I know you've got a lengthy agenda, and like I say, I went through dress rehearsal and it worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| so I apologize for what's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| And while we are dealing with technical difficulties, Attorney General Nichols is the next person to be on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1568)|
| 0:26:21| We may shuffle one back and forth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| If there be no objection, General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Randy Nichols, Knox County Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| And I'm very reluctant to jump in front of Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| As much money as he's giving to the Family Justice Center and the efforts he's making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I'm reluctant to jump in front of him doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| I've been asked to give you a brief update on the safety center idea, the behavioral health unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| whatever it may be you may wish to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| I'm pleased to report to all of you that things are progressing quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| We are meeting as late as today in a lengthy meeting today on some other ideas that touch it, that surround it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1621)|
| 0:27:09| that we think will complement it when we start dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| We're not quite ready just yet to ask you to put it on your agenda for any appropriation of monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| We're a little bit away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| But I think you're going to see that good things will be presented to you for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| as early as January or February of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| Finally, it's beginning to gel and come together where we think we can understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| we can parse it, and put it back together into pieces that will fit our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| So the work's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| I think it's going to be good work, and I think it will be something that we'll all be proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| and I think it's going to save us some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| and I think it's going to help a lot of families in Knox County to re-assimilate with their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| and be able to better take care of them than we can do in a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| So I hope to be able to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| You'll have me back soon, and I can be a little bit more explicit with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| And in the interim, if you think there's any questions I can answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| I'll be happy, of course, to take any questions members of the commission would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| With that, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you, General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Randy, don't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Oh, we have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I almost got away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| You didn't think I was going to let you off that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| I can't get away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I would just like for you to, you and I have been in touch on this, to keep in touch on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| and as soon as you get ready for us to put a resolution together on the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| let us know and we'll do whatever we need to do to get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| I hope to do that real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you, General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I appreciate your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I know it's been a long eight or ten months that you've been working on it solely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Okay, continuing on with Clerk of Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Is that a good title, Clerk of Courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I've been called worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Oh, Chair of Commission, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Thanks again for allowing me to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Ladies and gentlemen of the commission, it was September of last year that an investigation began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| into what we called an undistributed account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Now, this was not a rogue account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| This was an account that was on the books, but as we began to look at this account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| we wanted to take a look at exactly what made up this account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| and exactly what we needed to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| We met with our Knox County auditors, we met with our clerk officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| and we determined that in that account we had $2,613,742.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| Now, this money had been accumulated over the time span of 40 to 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| We filed a report with the Department of Revenue immediately and said we need to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| And so our state audit team, our clerk finance team, our Knox County finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| and the Knox County law director all met and determined that that account needed to be frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| So that account was frozen in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| What that meant was we could take money out, but no more money was going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| Now, you may recall that the way this worked in the criminal court office was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| if people paid us money for fines, fees, and forfeitures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| that money was put into what was called the undistributed account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| and it stayed there until the account was paid in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| November 12th, a report was presented to me, and there were certain findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| and we agreed with those findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Now, I want to call your attention to the fact that we began this in September of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| The report was not issued until November the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| The reason for that is that we met many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| This was an extremely complicated matter to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| There were thousands of cases involved in this undistributed account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| and as I mentioned, it went back 40 to 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| We wanted to make sure that when we had everything done, everything was done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| every I dotted and every T was crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| There were three findings, and I want to talk about two of them now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and the third one in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| The finding from the state was that previous clerks had failed to report and pay litigation taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| It was also determined that this error occurred during the previous administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| No financial penalty was assessed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Now, the state could have assessed a financial penalty, but they chose not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and they said the reason that they did not was because we self-reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| We told them we were up front with them and said we've got an account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| We're not really sure what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| We need to look into it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| They did, however, assess interest, but as you might imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| trying to assess interest over 40 years was a bit difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| but we were able to come to an agreement on the interest that they had assessed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| So we met with the state on November the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| They presented us with what they believed we owed the state from this account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| We agreed, and the total amount of monies owed and paid to the state was $518,502.09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1938)|
| 0:32:27| So that money has been paid to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| They're happy campers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| But what about Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Well, as I mentioned, we froze the account, which meant that money did not go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| but money was still coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| So as people would come and pay, we distributed that money as we were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| Now let me also add that we distributed our monies monthly in our other two offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| our Sessions and Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| It was not being done this way in criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| I don't have the reason for you as to why that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| But the monies from the undistributed account that were dispersed from September 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| to August 2015 to Knox County was $420,526.22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| So that money was paid on a regular basis through August of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| Now, we chose to close the account in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| And again, this was in consultation with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| When we closed the account, that means no money was coming out, no money was coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| but whatever was left needed to be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| So we distributed over $500,000 to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| And so after going through all of the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| today we are going to present to Knox County a check for $1,164,281.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2021)|
| 0:33:51| So the total amount of monies from that account being distributed to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| $1,584,807.53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| That represents 61% of that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Now, you remember that there were two findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| There was a third finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| And if you've been up at 3 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| and you've seen those Ginsu knife commercials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| it always says, but wait, there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| So wait, there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| You remember in September of last year I appeared before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| and told you that our bank account had been drained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| After we had our first payroll, we had $9,000 in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| This was a violation of state law and county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Because under state law, we are required to have three months of monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| to pay for our payroll, our benefits, and operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| So first of all, thank you for not putting me in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| You gave us $600,000 that had been given to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| before I took office in excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| So that money was put back into our account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| What we decided to do was to really put our nose to the grindstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| to operate as efficiently as possible and go about collecting our monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| And I'm pleased to say that as of today, we are now solvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| We have $1.5 million in our savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| So that means that we now have the three months that state law requires us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| So because of that, we are now able to process excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| So on a monthly basis, if we have enough money to take care of our operating expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| and because we're solvent, we can now turn over excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| So today, we're turning over to Knox County another check for $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| which represents our excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| So today, commissioners, the clerk's office, and our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| are turning over $1,214,281.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| Now, you remember that there was a third finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| And the third finding was that we needed to distribute money on a monthly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| as opposed to the way it was being done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| We started doing that in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| The old method, which was the method previous to when we took office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| and I wanted to show you the numbers from October, November, and December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| that was paid to Knox County, was $82,515.36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| The new method, as we begin to transition January, February, and March of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| was $232,214.74, which is an increase of almost $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2182)|
| 0:36:31| Bottom line, more money is coming to Knox County and to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| and all of the other categories that we are required to pay into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| But I have an ask, and this is what I call the big ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| I will be coming before you again next month asking you for $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| from the monies that we have given you today to improve our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Not money to come to the clerk's office, but our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I think that I can convince you that we need to spend this money to upgrade our courtrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| upgrade the areas where we have attorney-client consultations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| upgrade our juror experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| And I think $30,000 is a very small amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| but that should be more than enough to take care of what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| We have chairs that don't have arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| We have chairs that are ripped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| We have chairs that have been there for 30 years, and they have tremendous stains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| I think we can do better, not only for our attorneys and our judiciary, but for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| So with that, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to present these checks to Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2254)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Tamara Shepard has signed up on public forum to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| Name and address for the record, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Tamara Shepard, 4612 Meredith Road in Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| I told a friend this morning that I would be coming down to the county commission this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| to practice a little advocacy through the rearview mirror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| My understanding from the Knox County Law Director, Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| is that the superintendent's contract on which you're poised to vote tonight is already a binding contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| having been signed by both the chairman of the Board of Education and by the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| I've nevertheless come here today to urge you to cast your no vote on the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| in protest that the board has adopted an extension of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| halfway through the term of the existing contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| which is an action that both Mr. Armstrong and the state attorney general have informed us is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| Concerning the letter from the state AG that was requested by Representative Harry Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| and delivered to Mr. Armstrong last week, allow me to clarify that the letter itself is not the AG's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| I'm hearing some misunderstanding on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| In fact, what the letter said twice is that his office would decline to opine on the issue now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| because his office had already opined on it in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| at which time the state AG had specifically declared that the practice of extending the term of a superintendent's contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2362)|
| 0:39:30| midway into the contract is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Furthermore, the state AG's office also pointed out in that letter that since 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| a 2005 court ruling in Heatherley v. Campbell County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| has actually upheld the AG's 2001 opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| The red piece of paper in front of each of you is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| I wanted to be sure that I copied you, if you hadn't seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| with a copy of the state AG's 2001 opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| I direct your attention to the second page, second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| What it says is, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| by extending the term of the contract by two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| the board has effectively given the director of schools a six-year term, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| It says, quote, the law does not state that the term of the contract may be extended, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| The law we're talking about is noted in code in the footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| But more importantly, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| here is the rationale that the state AG offered for its opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| that has since been upheld at trial, and I'll quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| The Education Improvement Act of 1992,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| and you hopefully know that that is the system that gave us an appointed superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| and an elected board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Education Improvement Act of 1992| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| established a uniform system of accountability to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| for what is happening in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| The EIA established a single system of school boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| elected for staggered four-year terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| who hire superintendents under contract for terms up to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| The superintendent answers to the board who answers to the electorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| Here's the meat and taters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| By providing new board members may be elected two years into a four-year contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| with the director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| the statutory scheme contemplates that the electorate will have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| to express its satisfaction or dissatisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| with the decisions in contact with the superintendent selected by the previous board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Ladies and gentlemen, it was not accidental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| that we have this recurring schedule of new board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| stepping into the picture every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| to carry to their positions the desires of the electorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| If the school board who hired the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| could extend the term of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| that board has effectively put the superintendent's evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| and continued employment beyond the accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| and control of any new board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| elected two years following the selection of the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| Ladies and gentlemen, you swore an oath to uphold the laws of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and you now know with certainty what state law says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| regarding a school board's ability to extend the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| of a superintendent's contract midway through that contract's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| The system of accountability legislators sought in passing the EIA is crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| That the contract before you tonight was illegally extended as to its term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| is also crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| That you must cast a no vote on this item is also crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| Do your duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Continuing one more step with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Mr. Mark Rivera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| Mr. Mark Rivera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| Mr. Rivera called me earlier today about a request for a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2626)|
| 0:43:55| concerning marriage equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| Since then there have been several other sign-ups for public forum related to this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2642)|
| 0:44:12| I believe the request for public forum was to request commission to entertain a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2652)|
| 0:44:23| in support of marriage equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| The issue is not before us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| I am now looking for a commissioner that may support such a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2674)|
| 0:44:46| if there is no support for the resolution at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| The problem that I have as the chair of commission is that our agenda was set on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| It was submitted on the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| It was set on the 9th, reviewed this past Monday, and is before us tonight in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2702)|
| 0:45:14| If there is someone that can give a rationale why we should be entertaining a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| for something that is already a part of the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| and has already been passed by the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| and for which now I'm beginning to argue both sides of the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2729)|
| 0:45:41| I look for your commission guidance if we should continue further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| and I recognize Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| The only thing we have an obligation to tonight is, as it's always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| we have a public forum session in our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| in which any citizen can come and talk on any subject that they wish to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| That does not tie us to any sort of resolution in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2769)|
| 0:46:22| Those are totally two separate issues, just like we had last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| This is a totally separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| This is not on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| and the only obligation we have is for the folks to use the public forum for their speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Mr. David Payne, please, Mr. David Payne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| Give your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| David Payne, 1316 Mark Joseph Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Just a clarification, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| The speaker that was going to speak previously to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| he was proposing a resolution in favor of marriage equality or against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| Against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| He's not here to state what his request was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| So I moved home to Knoxville in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I was away for about five years overseas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| and one of the things that really struck me about my hometown after coming home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| was how much it had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| A lot more different sorts of people, a lot more things to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| but there was also a maturity, a shift and a deepening of maturity that I sensed immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| And part of that came politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| If you were a Democrat or a Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| I think we can all agree that Mayor O'Hara's election was a turning point for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| And I think that showed that our people and our community were really moving in a direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| if not necessarily more liberal or more progressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| then at least a bit more tolerant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Because some of the things that she campaigned on were very clearly things that our city needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| things that we needed to sort of incorporate into our brand, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| as far as being a more welcoming place and a more hospitable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| And I just want to say that if you are ever formally asked to consider a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| like the one that Mr. Rivera just brought to you or was considering to bring to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| please just say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| That's not publicity that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| It's not something that Blount County needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| And as the chairman of the commission just noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| it is something that the Supreme Court has already ruled on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| and it's something that is now a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| So I would appreciate it if you all would, going forward, consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| and consider those sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you, Mr. Payne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Gwen Shedlick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| Name and address for the record, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Gwen Shedlick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| I live in Blount County at 322 Abram Street, but I work at 10 Church and I shop in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Again, it has come to my attention that the commissioners were contacted about introducing a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| urging the Tennessee General Assembly to defy the Supreme Court's marriage ruling in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| I respect all opinions on the marriage debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| As a person of faith myself, I am quite familiar with the arguments that will, without doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| will continue in many settings like Sunday school classes and around the family dinner table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| I request that the Knox County Commission not take up a resolution on this matter for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| Such a resolution would not represent my views and the views of the many good people that I know in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Additionally, the resolution would have no legal effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| and it would nevertheless be divisive during the holidays when we should be focused on unity and goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| The resolution would invite negative attention to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| We all want more economic opportunity for our families and friends and neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| and have we had the time to consult with area chambers of commerce about this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| These resolutions encourage expensive lawlessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| and already the state is being billed for a $2.3 million case in regards to the June marriage case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| and the Supreme Court, as you have said, Chair, has ruled and the matter is settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| I think these are the reasons why Franklin and Blount counties have refused these past resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| and I ask that you demonstrate the same wisdom. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you, Ms. Shedler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Anna Masson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3028)|
| 0:50:38| Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Your name and address for the record, please. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| Anna Masson. I live at 821 Evolve Way, Knoxville, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| So the day that the Supreme Court decision was passed down was one of the happiest of mine and my wife's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| We'd already been planning our ceremony, and to find out that it was going to be legal was absolutely awesome for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| And since it was going to be legal, it kind of put a little hitch in our plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| and we were able to have Madeline Rajero marry us in her chambers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| and that was something very special for us, and it meant a lot to us to have someone in that position perform our ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| And we're now beginning to start a family in Knoxville, and it was an ease on our hearts and minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| knowing that our marriage was legally binding and that our child, whom we already love so much in our hearts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| even before their conception, would be able to have both of his or her parents recognized as a married couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| and not to have to add another step to the already complicated process that their mother and I would have to endure to have this child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| and to be able to be recognized as a family and make sure that both of his or her mothers are just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| And clearly, recognized as a family is something that we want to make sure continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| And like everyone else has kind of said, a city resolution trying to nullify something that's already been decided by the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3126)|
| 0:52:18| is in no way something that me as a resident here wants to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3138)|
| 0:52:28| or it doesn't do anything but spread hatred and intolerance and shatters the illusion that our family had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3148)|
| 0:52:37| that we were respected and valued residents, and I hope that if something like this comes before you again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| that you will choose not to take up the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Thank you, Ms. Masson. Elizabeth Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3165)|
| 0:52:55| Name and address for the record, and you have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| My name's Elizabeth Owen. I also live at 821 Evolve Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| I'm Anna's wife, as she mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| And so we both grew up in Tennessee and have been residents of Knox County for a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3191)|
| 0:53:20| I moved to Knoxville to go to UT and chose to stay here because I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| I love this city and this county. I love this part of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| And it just broke my heart to hear that someone had written a resolution that y'all were going to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3210)|
| 0:53:39| that was looking to take away rights that we had fought for for so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| and that the Supreme Court finally granted us in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| All through June, every day that was a decision day for the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| I was looking at their blogs at work and I was trying to find out what was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| And so the day that it finally passed, I saw it and I texted Anna and I just couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3244)|
| 0:54:14| It was so amazing. And it was actually my mom's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| And it was just so amazing, such a gift for our family, for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| that we can be fully recognized as citizens, as residents of this country and of this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| Growing up in a state that had previously refused to recognize us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3271)|
| 0:54:40| or would have refused to recognize us, it was really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| And growing up knowing that there were politicians and other important people in my area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3284)|
| 0:54:56| who didn't think that I should have the right to marry the person that I love, it was really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| And I know that if this resolution were to pass, or if the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| were to pass a resolution attempting to overturn the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| that it wouldn't be legally binding and it wouldn't do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| But I'm afraid for all the little kids who would see that happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| and the message that it would send to the little kids and other residents of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| and beyond the state. We don't live in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Other folks would hear about it and would feel that reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| and would know that they would not be fully accepted for who they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| in our state, in our county, in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| And I just think that that would be a real hardship for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| It would be bad for our economy. It would be bad for us in every way that you can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| And so I urge you all to not take up an issue that is legally a dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3357)|
| 0:56:08| and to consider what it would mean for kids coming up and for others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3368)|
| 0:56:16| if you were to take it up, that it would be really an unkindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| Thank you, Ms. Owens. Gloria Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3383)|
| 0:56:33| Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| And thank you for lifting the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Gloria Johnson, 2506 Bryce Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you so much for allowing me to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| I've heard that some counties in East Tennessee and Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| are trying to pass anti-marriage equality resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| I never imagined Knox County would be one of these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| I hope there's no plan to try this here, especially in the way some counties are doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| by adding it last minute to the agenda without ever posting it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| That's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I know some of my friends have personal objections to marriage equality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| but they know the importance of being accepting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| They also know that no matter what they believe in their home or their church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| it's not okay to discriminate against those who believe differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| That's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I've seen what happens when my LGBT friends and neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| are discriminated against by citizens and by our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| I've seen students bullied and ostracized at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| sometimes resulting in tragic endings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| This resolution sends a terrible message to LGBT youth and adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Your rights don't count here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| You aren't equal in Knox County. You don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| That's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| I'll never forget the day of the SCOTUS decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| I can't tell you how many people came up to me to tell me that for the first time in their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| they felt like a complete U.S. citizen, fully respected and acknowledged by their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| I can't imagine what it feels like not to be allowed by my government to marry who I love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| but I can sure guess, after seeing the joy in my friends' faces, what it meant to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| And I was honored I got to celebrate their joy with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| This is who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| This weekend, I came across a Facebook post from a friend of mine from Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| Here's what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Y'all, in six hours, at the age of 54, I will be married, legally married,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| in my church, in my very own state, in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| I never dreamed this would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| God bless the USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| This is who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| She met her partner more than 30 years ago, about the time I met my husband, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| My marriage lasted about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| They've been together for more than 30 years and have a beautiful family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| I can't imagine any rationale to keep them from getting married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Marriage equality doesn't require any religion to change any of its tenets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| It just stops the government from being able to discriminate regarding who can marry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| For me, the cost to people is most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| but it would be remiss if I didn't mention the cost of discrimination to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| Legislation like this will be legally challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| It will be expensive, and the challengers will lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| The taxpayers will pay the cost of that legal battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| That's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| The taxpayer will also see the cost and loss of economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| as businesses choose to locate or relocate in areas that are more inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| That's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Knox County can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| We can acknowledge that the rights of a minority should never be something the majority votes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| That's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| I hope that soon the term marriage equality is rarely uttered or heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| but we all simply refer to marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| That is who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Love is love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3604)|
| 1:00:16| Now, listen to me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| All of the signups that I have now for public forum are in relationship to the Secure Us contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3619)|
| 1:00:28| Is there anyone else that has signed up other than the Secure Us contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| And I see Mr. Rogers raise his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Please, Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Steve Rogers, 1120 Palo Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Good evening, and thank you for affording me the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| For natural speaking patterns' sake, I'm going to say the word you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| but it's more of an everyman one, like one would do such and such, or one believes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| But it's not natural to say that, so I'm going to be saying the word you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| The laws of the United States of America are built on the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| which is codification of the law our country has agreed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| to set the social structure in this great nation, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| You don't get to debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| It's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| An opinion of it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Opinions are feelings that someone has about something they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| Well, we know that federal law supersedes state and local law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| unless provision in the federal law allows exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| You can't feel your way around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| You accept it, grow up, reevaluate your feelings based on that knowledge of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| I felt that I had to start with that information because it came to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| and apparently to quite a few other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| that someone had a proposal to add to today's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| an agenda that says despite the greatest legal structure on the planet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| someone's feelings are hurt that everyone gets married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| to whatever consulting adult wants to also marry them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| Now, I don't know the person's reasoning for that, although it is highly unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| But I do have some facts that are measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| These are concrete, tangible things that one can know to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| and then let their personal moral compass guide them to an opinion based on those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| One, no one's marriage affects your marriage, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Your neighbor down the street, regardless of the gender of any person in that marriage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| has zero effect on your marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| If your marriage is weaker because your neighbor got married,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| your marriage sucks and don't take it out on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Number two, I understand that you might have a religious objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| That is exactly why this country was built on not using any one individual religion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| to determine the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Otherwise, Red Lobster would be out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| That's a shellfish joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| What you do in your church is up to your own church, really, 100%, truly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| You do your own thing because that's the way it's structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| You don't get to tell other churches what they can do in their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| regarding the love of one or two of their congregants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Three, on the religion thing, you can get married in places that aren't churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| You don't need a minister for a valid marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| In fact, the marriage being sought to protect is a government function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| And yes, I know churches have the ceremony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| but if the paperwork isn't signed and in the courthouse, are you married?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| So marriage is secular when the law is talking about it, which is brilliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| No one denomination gets to bully any other denomination around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Four, in Knox County, there are so many churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| that are glad to have the law set up the way it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| because they can fully support the members of their church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| This law gave power to more churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| because they can now perform a ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| and attach government certification of benefits to the couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| who is participating in that ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Honestly, churches getting more freedom to operate should be a win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| for the opponents of gay marriage, but whatever, logic isn't for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Point number five, perhaps you have a historical misunderstanding of marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| Your denomination most likely wasn't the one to invent marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| In our country, Native Americans were performing marriages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| including same-sex marriages, long before European culture came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| And in Europe, pagan cultures had marriages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| before Mediterranean religions came northward, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Read a history book that isn't from the Texas Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| Point number six, there is a risk that you brought forward this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| because you don't understand the function of marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| You might think that marriage is a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| wherein a woman is turned into a baby-making machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Clearly, this is false and ludicrous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Women are complete human beings whether or not you believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| the thing about man losing a rib to make her or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Women don't exist to churn out babies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| and marriage isn't even the process by which that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Clearly, sex education in Tennessee needs to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| if marriage is to believe the way babies happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| So, if marriage is just a way to control sex, then you're doing it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| There are tons of marriages that are beautiful and perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| and don't have babies coming out of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| whether by choice, medical reasons, bad luck, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| The lack of a child does nothing to affect the validity of a marriage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| unless you're a sociopath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Point number seven, maybe you think gay couples being married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| and adopting kids will harm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| You have that confused with gay conversion therapies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| which have been proven to be harmful for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| and ruled to be abuse under law in many jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| What you meant to say is that there are numerous studies from around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| to show a net positive experience for children raised in same-sex households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| This might be crazy, but maybe kids just grow up healthier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| when they're surrounded by love and not bigotry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| But I'm just going off the research and common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Eight, this one's a classic, it's not natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| Homosexual relationships have been documented in hundreds of species on this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| That's impressive considering that complex animals with social structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| are super infrequent in the grand scale of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Basically, homosexual relationships in a species| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| are an indicator of complexity in a creature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| So if you want to continue doing whatever you're doing in your church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| based off a Hebrew translation of Koine Greek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| translated by Englishmen with an ax to grind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| feel free to do that in your own church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| The rest of us, we're going to be over here rejoicing in the love of two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and the freedom to do so in a country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| that is stepping up to the plate when it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| pursuit of happiness for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I fully expect you guys to shoot anything like that that comes before you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| Love wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| I stated a moment ago, I would like to add the stipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| that the remainder of public forum is attached to the Securus item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| which is item 301, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Is there anyone disagreeing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| If not, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I've been zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Your subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| The way is not until after 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Whenever we have an item before us, the pros and cons each have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| In this Secure thing for the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| are they going to have five minutes each or five minutes total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| They have requested that their public forum be moved to the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| So they will still have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Whether it's five minutes now or five minutes then, it's still five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| A piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| You want to hear them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| No, that's not the way we do items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Yes, sweetheart, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| They've got a total of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Commissioner Broyles, we are now moving into honoraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Commissioner Broyles, item 101, will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| Yes, we're going to defer that to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| I was hoping that he could be here tonight, but unfortunately he cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Dr. Carsello, Madam Clerk, would you read item 102?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4074)|

| 1:10:57| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| I just wanted to say briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| that it's been an incredible honor and privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| to serve with Dr. Carsello on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| I have learned a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| about government accounting and auditing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| under his leadership on the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| and we will miss him tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| So I'm grateful we have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| to honor you tonight, Joe, and keep in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| Former Commissioner and current Knox County Trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| I didn't step up here to say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| but thank you for allowing me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| I was honored to be Dr. Joe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Dr. Carsello's Vice Chair for six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| on the Audit Committee and learned a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| and it was interesting hearing the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Some of them were tumultuous times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| and I think we did a few good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| and thank you for all the years of great service, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| About every other month, there is a magazine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| that comes out of the University of Tennessee Business School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| I believe the headline on it now says Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| My copy came just a couple of days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| and as I pointed out to you in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| when the Business School magazine comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| Dr. Carsello has frequently appeared in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| and he is in this month's issue of that magazine also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| Dr. Carsello has been with us for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| He's become so good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| that he's been recognized just not at the county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| He now has to fly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| I guess he's getting the University of Tennessee frequent flyer miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| to and from Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| in a capacity of advising and working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| for the United States government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| I think it appropriate that we recognize him at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| for the work that he's done for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| for Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| for the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| and most importantly for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you, Dr. Carsello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4406)|
| 1:13:41| It's very nice to be recognized in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| I'm not going to say a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Back on when I joined the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I never thought I would really be involved in local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| It certainly was not an ambition of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| and we've lived here a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| and as the resolution said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| it was a tumultuous time in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| and it seemed that every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| under the prior years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| there was a lot of controversy in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| and I thought maybe I could help a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| by improving trust in financial reporting and controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| and so that's why I came forward to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| and the seven years I served, I enjoyed it, learned a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| and it's like most things in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| the things you remember the most are the people you worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| and it was a pleasure to work with Dave and Finbar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| and Ed originally and Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| and then Amy came on later and David and Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| and so it was a pleasure to work with all of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| obviously to work with Chris Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| who I think he does a tremendous job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| and Maya Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| So I enjoyed it, I enjoyed the relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Hopefully we made a small improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| I think you have a wonderful group continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| I think David Shields will be a wonderful successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| I have a lot of confidence in him and the people on the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| A really strong external auditing firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| good internal audit group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| So I think you're in good hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| and in reference to my trips to Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| just since the media's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| the University of Tennessee does not pay for those trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| The United States Securities and Exchange Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| pays for those trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| But thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| and it's a pleasure to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| Madam Clerk, would you call the name of the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| what's 103?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| We've got a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| We need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Okay, the next resolution is 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| It's honoring Robert H. Sturkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| for his years of distinguished service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| as commissioner at the West Knox Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Mr. Sturkey, is Mr. Sturkey in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Mr. Sturkey is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Let's make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| and we'll get it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Motion has been made to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| and the resolution will be delivered to Mr. Sturkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| Motion's probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Commissioner McKenzie will lead our devotional invocation this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| There are kind of three aspects, phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| I'd like to give attention to during tonight's devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| First of all is Le'Veon Dobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| He's the young man I think we've all heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| We've heard the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| so I definitely won't recount it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| because it's beautiful and tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| But I just wish he could see the outpouring of love nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| for his selfless act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| He was a hero walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| There are very few people that walk toward the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| and he had a moment to think and he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| Martin Luther King, Jr. said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| if a man doesn't have anything worth dying for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| then he's not fit to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Le'Veon's protection of womanhood allowed him to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| Some may question that decision, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| because that was a fabric that he was made of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| Again, it's a beautiful story, but it breaks your heart as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| I'd just like to, to his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| thank you for creating such a lovely young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| Second, this will probably be my last opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| to lead a devotion before this august body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| as a sitting commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| A couple of y'all guys may want to invite me back or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| but I'll be leaving office next calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| A couple of things that during this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| what will be eight and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| about eight years up to this point, right Dave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| has kind of stuck out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| A lot of it centers around our pledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| our pledge of allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| As we have, what you'll probably hear in a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| is during the portion that says one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| we generally pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| Commissioner Brown doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| It got me to thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| We tend to want to separate that one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| It's one nation under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| That's what this country was created for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| All right, I feel like a Baptist preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| I got a lot of preachers in the house here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| I'll go long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| But, you know, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| that hadn't gone unnoticed, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| That may upset some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| I don't really care, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| This was a nation created under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| The second part of that pledge that happened years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| and I've tried to in my own way continue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Commissioner Harmon, as the pledge goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and as it winds toward an end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| it says liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Commissioner Harmon always emphasized the all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Got in the microphone and emphasized that all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| And there's nothing on the other side of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| There's nothing on the other side of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| There's not all but the people I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| or the entities that I like or the things that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| I mean, you know, it's liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| And so that just really kind of rang true to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| And the last, you know, I've had a lot of occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| to pray before this body, and I will in a second or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| But one thing that you all may or may not have noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| or learned is every time I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| I lead each prayer off with a few lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| from the last stanza of the Negro National Anthem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| So as you pray with me, kind of listen to the first part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| and I think you'll agree that that was a beautifully created song| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| and poem and prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| So let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| thou who has brought us thus far on our way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| thou who has by thy might led us into the light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| keep us forever in thy path, we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| Most gracious heavenly Father, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| we just come to you tonight with knowing that you can do all things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| Lord, as we work through this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| as we have worked through this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4914)|

| 1:21:59| and we will tonight, Lord, but let everything be said and done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| It will be pleasing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Lord, we may not agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| We may not win every vote, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| but let us understand that this is the process ordained by you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| because we are one nation under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| And Lord, as we deal with these resolutions and basic laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| we know that they're for all Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| not just a few, but all county citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| So take care of us as we deliberate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| Bless your son in the season of his birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=4950)|

| 1:36:20| Can I ask a question? Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| While some of us may not agree with the terms of the contract, but where does this, this being a consent item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| where does this place us if, I mean, if there are 11 no's, I mean, it's still a binding contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5795)|
| 1:36:42| So, Mr. Law Director, where does this place us with the school board and the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| As I stated the other night, this is a pro forma act on behalf of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| If it were not for the consent agreement, it would not be over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| The state, the Board of Education has the statutory power to enter into a contract with the director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5822)|
| 1:37:10| and they alone, with their vote, created a valid contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| And the agreement that was made said that all contracts would come over to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5836)|
| 1:37:24| And so it will have no effect on the offer extended to Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| whatever this board votes and whatever way it deems to dispose of this issue at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| It is an item not on consent because it was never on consent and was never voted to be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5857)|
| 1:37:45| But it is an item that can be addressed by this body any way it wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| But it will have no legal bearing at all on the offer of the Board of Education for Dr. McIntyre's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5869)|
| 1:38:00| Further questions, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, I struggle with the whole word consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| Commissioner McKenzie, we're not going to discuss it. All we're going to do is vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| We've already, we've had a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| I don't understand why this item wasn't included in the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| Following our rules, the item did not pass unanimously at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| By our definition, it must be considered at this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| But at this session, we cannot discuss the merits of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5919)|
| 1:38:52| So I guess, Mr. Law Director, since it cannot fail then, since we have to pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5932)|
| 1:39:01| should we just at this point, we've heard the yea and the nay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| shouldn't we just strike the gavel and pass the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| That was a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Under the rules, the votes, however they are, will count, however this body deems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| But the effect, there is no effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Like I said earlier, without the order of the agreement, this wouldn't even be over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5971)|
| 1:39:41| So it's over here to be disposed of as this body sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| But the disposal, whether you pass it or whatever you do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| has no effect whatsoever upon the school board's vote to enter into a contract with the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| And your rules will prevail as to how you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| And the chairman will usually declare the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| A no vote here is just saying, well, we can't tell them what to do about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| because they've already voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| We don't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| That's basically what it comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| But you don't agree with what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Is there a call for a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6030)|

| 1:40:39| You can think of what the rule is on roll call votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| I believe we've gone through the first district, second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6042)|

| 1:41:53| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Could we have a short recess, please, before this next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| Are you expecting it to go long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| We will have a ten-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Let me rephrase that, since it's not in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| We will have a ten-minute recess if there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| Thanks for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| We will resume where we had left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| Is that item 301, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| It is on page 7, which is the resolution approving a contract with Securus Technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| Incorporated for the provision of an inmate communication and management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Motion to approve has been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| We have several names of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6174)|
| 1:43:05| Public forum will be, for those that have signed up, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6185)|
| 1:43:13| But one of the trends that I saw in last week's public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| as relates to this Securus Technologies, Incorporated contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| two items that revolve around the Sheriff's Department policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| are not policies of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| In other words, we, the setting commission, cannot influence the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6218)|
| 1:43:46| on his decisions related to visitation policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6226)|
| 1:43:53| Also, the Sheriff, as a standalone entity elected by the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6233)|
| 1:44:02| prepares and presents a budget to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| effectively insulating Knox County for having control over the Sheriff's staffing decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6246)|
| 1:44:16| So as we go through public policy discussions this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| related to the contract before us for Securus Technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6261)|
| 1:44:30| whatever we want to call this, video link or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| the visitation policies of the Sheriff and the staffing policies of the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| are not part of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| And talking about it or addressing those to us probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6282)|
| 1:44:54| well, I'm not going to say it's a waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| I'm saying it's a comment to a body that has no control of those two particular policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6296)|
| 1:45:12| Commissioner McKenzie, before we commence with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| You put that very, very well and succinctly in terms of what's before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| I would, however, say that in terms of the Sheriff's budget, I do think that in a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6328)|
| 1:45:37| and what we heard last week was there were budgetary considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| which facilitated the decision to end in-person visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| So, you know, as folks are out there thinking about what they're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| I'm glad you made that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| What's before us tonight is not in-person visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| That decision was made by the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| But, you know, it was at least somewhat driven by his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| And every year there's a budget that gets presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| So I just want to make sure that everyone understands exactly where we are in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6372)|
| 1:46:24| Kumi Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6384)|
| 1:46:40| My name is Kumi Morgan, address 241 Hawthorne Avenue, 37920 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| So I've come to speak on the Secures contract and my concerns with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| In terms of who has to ultimately pay the cost of having only video visitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| it's families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| It's punishing families of incarcerated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| It's punishing incarcerated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| It's punishing the over 70% of people in Knox County jails that actually haven't been convicted of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| And that's something that is actually, we can't just talk about a contract with video visitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| and not talk about the fact that video visitations is something that the county is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| and this company is doing to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| And the only way for them to make money is to ban in-person visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| So to talk about this contract and to not talk about the fact that they were banned because of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| and of the previous contract that they have right now doesn't do justice to what actually is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| There's also a lot of concerns with Secures in general as some of the folks that have been researching this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| have found that, you know, they state on their website that all of their rates are subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| And I went through, I've been picking through their contract repeatedly that's online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| and I can't find anything that says that the rates that they have right now are not going to be going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| There's nothing that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| And so right now it could be $0.20 per minute for on-demand or $6 for 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| They only get a week, I mean one hour per week to actually have a visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| There's nothing that says that those numbers won't be going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| and I think that's incredibly concerning because who has to pay the cost of these video visitations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| It's families and loved ones and incarcerated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| And there's a dehumanizing aspect of this that is going to come when you criminalize anyone in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| and when the Sheriff's Department stands up in here and says that there's a 30% increase in the jail population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6518)|
| 1:48:48| and it's understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| I don't think the solution is to add more staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| I think the solution is to decriminalize and to lower the prison population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| And one way of doing that is certainly to address recidivism rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| and recidivism rates are directly tied to not being able to have in-person visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| to be able to visit people, to be able to see the people that you love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| And so I think this contract is incredibly harmful because it's a way to continue to cement the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| that in-person visits are banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| They're going to be doubling the amount of video visitation kiosks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| They're going to be adding remote visitation kiosks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| And while this is something that could be helpful to people who aren't able to visit jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| it needs to be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| And I understand that it isn't in the contract to ban in-person visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| but this company as of May had it in their contract that you had to ban in-person visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| because they understood that by having in-person visits people would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| unless they couldn't, they would have in-person visits with their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| and then this company and the county wouldn't be making any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| And in this contract the county is going to be making over 61% profit from phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| and over 50% profit or about 50% profit from the video visitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| And so when we talk about budget, where is all that money going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| And how come the county can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| I don't believe that we should be having additional staffing members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| I think we should be decriminalizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| But if the county is saying that they just can't have video in-person visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| because of budgeting concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| I think we could look at the money that they're generating from these video visitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| could be a way of addressing the fact that they don't have the budgetary means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| to be having in-person visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| So I just urge you all to think about the big picture of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| and also I urge people to look at the contract in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| Just the way that folks have been talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| doesn't seem like people have actually read this contract in depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| and considered the real cost of who has to pay for these visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Second, Mark Brown II will be followed by Lita Meyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6652)|
| 1:51:04| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| My name is Mark Brown II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| My address is 5273 Brick Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| And the reason why I'm up here today is I want to urge you all to deny the securities contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| for the simple fact that they demand that there could be no visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| And that right there is inhumane in its very self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| You're denying these people the right to see people that they love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| The only means that they may have to have rehabilitation, the people that they love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| so when they get out there is no place for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| We need to find a way to stand by these people, to represent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| because they are not just inmate X5432D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| They are a human living person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| They are people who have made mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| If they had not made the mistakes they made, they very well may be on this commission right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| I would also like to leave with a statement that the moment that we stop caring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| and looking after one another is the moment that we lose our very humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Lita Mayer followed by Vivian Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| Lita Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| Lida Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Thank you for adjusting the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| It's Lida Mayer, and it's 4721 Clark Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6738)|
| 1:52:30| One thing I have discovered today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| if I ever want something on the agenda for the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| I'll do it in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| I tried to reach a lot of people who would be here today if they'd known about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| and they're gone. They're out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| It was very hard, the roads to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| There may be people who would have signed up if they could have gotten in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| Over 70% of the inmates at the county jail have never been convicted of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| They're there in pre-trial status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| 20% of the people there, over 20%, are on pre-trial status on a misdemeanor charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6786)|
| 1:53:17| But they're still lumped in the same boat with all the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| I know that one of the gentlemen who was here with the jail last week at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6801)|
| 1:53:31| stated that if people wanted personal visits, they shouldn't be in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| And I know that Amy Broyles asked if any of you had visited someone at the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6818)|
| 1:53:44| and you haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| Probably if someone in your family was arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| you have the money to post the bond, to get them out quickly, to get them a good attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| And even if you can't get them out quickly, you would be able to pay a good attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| to at least give them messages from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| because that's the only person that they can see face to face is an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Not their priest or minister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| No one but a very limited number of people who pay enough money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| if they can afford to pay it, to see them through a camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| It is very much a class issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Most of you probably have computers at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| An awful lot of the people in the county jail do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Their families do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| They may have access to going to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| There used to be county clerk's offices like in East Knoxville, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| that had computers, but they wouldn't have had access that supported this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| But they closed that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| So there's very limited options for a lot of people other than driving out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| if they have a car, beyond the bus routes to go out to the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| to use the kiosks that they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| And if they're late because whoever was giving them a ride didn't show up in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| or the taxi didn't show up in time, they missed that much of their visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| that they've signed up for 24 hours in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| I challenge you to try and go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| or even go online if you have computers and try to find out what that process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| because it's hard to even find out what you're supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| because I've tried that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| I know that Mike Hammond said he was glad he wasn't in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| but if he had been, he'd have gotten bonded out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| There's no question in my mind that there's a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| And if you have the home computer, it has to have the high-speed Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| and it has to be the right program, has to have the camera, has to have the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| And that's just a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| I'm sorry, I'd say most people in this room don't have that capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| so they are going to end up going out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| especially the people who actually land in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6964)|
| 1:56:11| The original commission meeting on this item, there was no argument about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| It was less than two minutes when they signed the current contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| which apparently had options in it for changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| It's a subsidiary of the same company, and yes, they were subject to change their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| I know that Amy Royals asked a number of issues, a number of questions from the county jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| Did you get answers back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Because we haven't, the questions we've asked, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| The current cost for an hour a week for a year would be $1,246 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| People who can't afford that, that don't have a way of getting out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| they have no visits, they have no way for this wonderful service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| But it would be great if they had that as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| Randy Nichols addressed mental illness as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| Lack of personal visits increase, prison violence, recidivism, mental breakdown, and suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7031)|
| 1:57:19| It's a 250-page contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I haven't read it, but have any of you read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| Has your law director gone over it thoroughly, you know, and vetted it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| Are there going to be changes that we don't expect at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| And is this just another issue of, you know, we're seeking liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| Is this another issue of socioeconomic status and race and class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| It's an echo of the powerlessness that caused the bitterness of the chastening rod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| So I ask you to give this further consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| make sure that there's not going to increase to their normal dollar an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| I mean dollar a minute rate that they seem to have in other places in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| You know, are we going to be there in a year even if it starts at a lower rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| Ken Williams will be followed by Michael McCaffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7092)|
| 1:58:21| Vivian Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| Michael McCaffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7111)|
| 1:58:50| Name and address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| My name is Vivian Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| My address is 5909 Meadowland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, area code 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7136)|
| 1:59:04| Thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| I come to you as a parent of a child that is incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7148)|
| 1:59:19| I didn't want to come because I didn't think I could stand here and talk to you and not cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| I'm going to try real hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| But I have a son who's at the prison, and when I go to visit him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| it's very uncomfortable because we're in such a small room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| There are at least six kiosks there, and there are at least two to three people at each kiosk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7180)|
| 1:59:52| trying to visit somebody, and you can't hear what somebody's saying on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7192)|
| 1:59:59| because there are so many voices going at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| So the visits are very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| Also, most of the times when you vote on something, you get the information that is given to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7206)|
| 2:00:18| I come to plead with you before you make this decision about this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| Please go to the prison, like the lady said, and see what it's like at one of the visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7224)|
| 2:00:32| Maybe your child will never be in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| Maybe you'll never have to go sit at a kiosk to see and talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| I plead with you as a parent to take into consideration that our children are as special to us as you are to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7241)|
| 2:00:54| And you need to go and take a look at what you're voting for before you cast your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Michael McCaffrey, followed by Crystal Gorley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7263)|
| 2:01:11| Michael McCaffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| Crystal Gorley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| Crystal Gorley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7279)|
| 2:01:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| My name is Michael McCaffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| I live on Lula Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| And one of the reasons that the Securus Corporation supplied for this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7294)|
| 2:01:44| was that it would help cut back on drug traffic that apparently is ostensibly occurring through these visitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7304)|
| 2:01:55| And the fact is that that wouldn't really curb the drug traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| Drug traffic really goes through staff and guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7321)|
| 2:02:09| Instead of this, in fact, cutting back on drug traffic, it would most likely increase it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7329)|
| 2:02:17| because these prisoners becoming dehumanized would be more likely to turn to drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7337)|
| 2:02:29| And recidivism would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| It is a big mistake to privatize correctional institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7354)|
| 2:02:42| because the company that is doing this would make a lot of money from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7362)|
| 2:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Crystal Gorley will be followed by Dr. Valentino J. McNeil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7371)|
| 2:03:02| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| Yes, my name is Crystal Tamera Gorley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| I reside at 235 Carter Road, Apartment P1, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7387)|
| 2:03:17| Looking at the video visitation from a standpoint that violates the correctional and policy best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| the American Correctional Association has stated the claim that inmate rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7404)|
| 2:03:32| was the initial goal in which they were striving to reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| However, with a lack of family-friendly communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| which is defined as written correspondence, in-person visitation, and reasonably priced phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7421)|
| 2:03:49| to say that rehabilitation is the primary goal for the Knox County Detention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| could not be more discomplacent from the actual truth within itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| The micromanagement issues that can typically be found within a securities contract are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| For all nonprofessional visitors, customers or officers will eliminate all face-to-face visitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| through glass or otherwise at the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| and will utilize video visitation for all nonprofessional on-site visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| Securis specifies that the county must pay for any free sessions that the county wants to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| because Securis has stated in their terms and conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| which can be found on Securis.net at the bottom of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| that they do not provide free on-site sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| which means that Securis is restricting the free on-site sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| and that pushes families towards paid remote visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| So who is actually paying for the free on-site visits in which we have been told will be provided for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| Because Securis is not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| How long are they going to be able to speak with their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| if the Knox County Detention Center is fiscally responsible for the free on-site visits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| Is it 5 minutes? Is it 10 minutes? Is it 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| Or is it, you know, an extended period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| And also, the surcharges, the taxes, and the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| which are found under the friends and family terms and conditions on the Securis.net website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| states that service fees, in addition to the service payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| and in consideration for the use of the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| you agree to pay Securis a fee for the use of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| You agree to pay Securis a fee for each scheduled Securis video visitation session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| at the applicable rates then in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| which will include applicable fees, taxes, surcharges, and other charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| The applicable service fees will be provided on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| All service fees are non-refundable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| Many police officers, they thrive on the ideology to just don't get arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7547)|
| 2:05:53| and that would be great, given that we would live in a perfect world, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| So, however, in order for an arrest to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| a police officer must use his or her discretion in whichever way they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| From here, a detainee must deal with being socially ostracized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| while sitting in a detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| even though they have yet to be found to be guilty of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| thus making them a pretrial detainee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| Regardless of how you feel about these inmates, bottom line, they are people, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| They should not be treated like chattel, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| it might not be wise to use another man's sins just so that you can pardon your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7595)|
| 2:06:44| Dr. Valentino J. McNeil will be followed by John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| We must pause for just a second, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| while I make a discussing announcement here with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| The hour is 7 o'clock, but since we have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| we must continue with this motion, and at the completion of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| we will resume some other discussion about our actions here at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7632)|
| 2:07:20| Doctor, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| Reverend Dr. Valentino J. McNeil, 5430 Haskin-O'Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7644)|
| 2:07:36| First, I'd like to say that it is utterly disingenuous to talk about this new securities technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7656)|
| 2:07:47| and not talk about the policies of visitation in our current Knox County jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7667)|
| 2:07:56| They are one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| When you remove physical visitation with video visitation, they are one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7680)|
| 2:08:10| And so if we're going to have a genuine, truth conversation on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| you absolutely, unequivocally cannot talk about the policies of the current county sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7696)|
| 2:08:25| I want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| Otherwise, we are wasting our time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Secondly, I don't believe that county jails or any correctional facilities should be a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7711)|
| 2:08:40| I truly believe in discipline, and those that violate our laws need to be punished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7720)|
| 2:08:48| I wholeheartedly believe that, and that's what keeps us a nation of laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7728)|
| 2:08:58| a nation that does not have anarchy in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| However, I'm not against technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| I have an iPad and an iPhone, and I honor technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| But also as a human being, as a person who has dedicated my life to taking care of the human element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7753)|
| 2:09:24| I am a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| I was a United States Air Force chaplain, and my life has been dedicated to serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7765)|
| 2:09:34| And when you divorce yourself of the human element by using technology to look into their eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7774)|
| 2:09:44| and be void of physical touch, you allow them to lose their humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7784)|
| 2:09:53| And when we are in a society that allows people to lose their humanity by the processes and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7793)|
| 2:10:01| that we promote and promulgate, we have lost ourselves as human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7801)|
| 2:10:08| And that's the real crux of the matter is, because I've made a mistake and deserve to be punished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7808)|
| 2:10:15| do I lose my very humanity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| Most people that are in prisons are poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| Their families are poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| And they cannot afford this stiff penalty of being paid to visit their loved one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7826)|
| 2:10:36| And so it is a classism, racism issue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| Because the majority of the people are poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| The majority of the people in the prison are the disenfranchised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| those that are of African descent and other ethnic groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| And so this is a new slavery in a real sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| The industrial prison complex, what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Let's get real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| We are making money off of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| Absolutely, we are making money off of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| And we are doing this at the stake of their humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| About a year and a half ago, I have a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| I had the unpleasant duty of visiting one of my parishioners at the county penal farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7884)|
| 2:11:35| I didn't get a chance to touch his hand, to look in his eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| I had to look at the kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| And I'm a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| And a pastor is supposed to have personal touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| This person could have easily committed suicide of the charge that he was challenged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| And I begged and I begged and I pleaded and I pleaded for the chaplain to allow me to go in and touch him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7918)|
| 2:12:07| And that very touch gave him hope that no matter what he was facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| that he could face it like a man and not kill himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| And so we're talking about human issues, life and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| And everyone there doesn't deserve a death penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| And so give them life by allowing them to keep the human element intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7953)|
| 2:12:41| John Butler, followed by Donna Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7961)|
| 2:12:52| John Butler, 1324 Yerkory Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7972)|
| 2:13:00| I come as a pastor and presiding elder, president of the NAACP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7980)|
| 2:13:07| and president of Knoxville Interdenominational Christian Ministerial Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| I have a concern about this contract in that it, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=7992)|
| 2:13:20| is a contract with extended years of 15 years, three five-year contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8000)|
| 2:13:29| And although you're not setting visitation policy at the detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8009)|
| 2:13:39| you are funding a policy at the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8019)|
| 2:13:46| This type of long-term policy says to me you're going to use this and you're going to use it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8026)|
| 2:13:54| So I think we have to look at that as an issue of how do we treat our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| Because the truth of the matter is that the people who stay in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| are the people who either have committed a crime that they can't make bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| or they don't have the money to make bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| And a great deal of people that I deal with are, in a lot of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| they can't make bond because they don't have the money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Poor people are the ones who go to jail most, stay in jail the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| And so I think that we have to look at how do we treat the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| Because if you're from a poor family, trying to get money for anything is difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8077)|
| 2:14:45| but especially somebody in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| So the least we can do is allow the families to visit in a way that they can spend quality time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8088)|
| 2:14:58| and not just quality money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| I've used the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| It is not a good system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Well, maybe I haven't used the system you're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| or that you're paying for for the detention center to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| But I've used the systems and it's not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| I've used the online system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| I wasted my money as well as my time using that system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| trying to talk with someone for any quality time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| So I think that my concern about the contract, especially the length of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8124)|
| 2:15:32| is that you have to make sure that we have something that's going to be an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8132)|
| 2:15:38| And I do think I could take my last two minutes wasting your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| talking about the visitation policy, the visitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| I won't do that because that's your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| But I just think about the times of the families who go to the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| sit around the kiosks trying to talk to families where other families are trying to talk to families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| and trying to deal with a situation where at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| this may be the best time for a mother or a father, grandmother, grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| someone to talk to that person who's incarcerated because now they're ready to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| I know as a pastor when I go in and talk to them, they've never heard a sermon before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| They're definitely hearing me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| So this is a time that we need to give for families to have an opportunity to really talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| and really spend time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| So please consider that as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| Vivian Williams talked so poignantly about visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| Even if you pass it, I would encourage you to go and see how that thing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| Go and see how you're spending the dollars and see if it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| Now I hope the contract has some kind of an out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| because when we see that it's not worth the money that we put in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| then what are we going to do then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8220)|
| 2:17:08| Donna Butler followed by John Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8228)|
| 2:17:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Donna Butler, 1324 Iroquois Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8237)|
| 2:17:27| I am a minister with Clinton Chapel AME Zion Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| a member of the Knoxville Interdenominational Christian Ministerial Allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8252)|
| 2:17:39| and a member of the Knoxville Branch NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8259)|
| 2:17:45| I come to speak with concerns about the detention center contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| I speak on behalf of families and loved ones of poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8273)|
| 2:18:00| and disenfranchised inmates in the Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| According to some data, usually over 70% of inmates are on pretrial status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8286)|
| 2:18:15| and have not been committed of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| I believe a great deal of the inmates who are on pretrial status cannot make bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8301)|
| 2:18:31| due to the lack of financial abilities of themselves and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8311)|
| 2:18:39| Considering that a large percent of inmates come from poor families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8319)|
| 2:18:46| and or disenfranchised communities and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| this contract could be economically unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8331)|
| 2:18:59| Please, please consider the concerns of the families of the poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8339)|
| 2:19:07| and the disenfranchised and how this policy may affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8347)|
| 2:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| John Mott followed by Nancy Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8362)|
| 2:19:37| My name is John Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| I'm at 4721 Clark Drive, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8381)|
| 2:19:50| Years ago, I had a boss that was new to the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| and since she didn't hire me, she wanted to know who I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| So I said I was my mother's son, my daughter's father, a brother to my siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8399)|
| 2:20:08| We define ourselves in relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| It's not just magic and looking in somebody's eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| We are defining ourselves in who we are in terms of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8416)|
| 2:20:22| The metaphor often used in child and family studies is that of a mobile hanging over a baby's crib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8422)|
| 2:20:32| And when something happens like incarceration, that mobile is disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| Maybe the piece has fallen out and the whole family is affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8438)|
| 2:20:47| To change metaphors, the thread is cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| The healthier the systems, the more systems one is involved in, the more health is that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8451)|
| 2:21:02| To lose personal contact is cutting the thread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| The prisons are full of people that no longer have family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8467)|
| 2:21:13| The jails are full of people that no longer are cared for by anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| They can't find anybody to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| You go through the process of getting a webcam set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| It hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| It's stated that you really didn't have charge over the visitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8493)|
| 2:21:41| He who holds the purse holds the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| Don't throw away your power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| You can take control of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| You can say we want personal visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| If you do pass this contract, we can come back with a new resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8512)|
| 2:22:02| Personal visits also have to be an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| But I urge you to put off this vote or vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8532)|
| 2:22:43| My name is Nancy Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| I live at 3117 East 5th Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| And I'm thinking as I listen to the various people who have spoken really powerfully about the need for us to consider the humanity of those who are incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8573)|
| 2:23:10| And as I came, that was my primary thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| But I'm also concerned about the humanity of each one of us as members of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8595)|
| 2:23:24| What kind of society do we want to live in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| It seems to me that we do understand, many of us understand, I think most of us understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8609)|
| 2:23:37| that we as human beings are defined by how we treat the least of those, our brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8617)|
| 2:23:50| As a Christian, but I think I would speak also for those of other faiths and no faiths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8630)|
| 2:23:59| I think we understand there is a powerful sense of Jesus' parable in Matthew 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8639)|
| 2:24:09| when he talked about the judging of the nations, not just people, not just you and me, but communities, societies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8649)|
| 2:24:22| And he's talking about those who are righteous and those who are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| Righteousness has to do with relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| And if you recall that parable, he is separating the people who have fed the hungry, who have given drink to those who are thirsty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8672)|
| 2:24:45| who have ministered to those who are sick, and specifically visited those who are in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| And they said to him, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| When did we see you hungry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| Because he said, inasmuch as you have done it to the least of these, you've done it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8699)|
| 2:25:05| And they said, well, when did we see you hungry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| When did we see you thirsty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| When did we see you sick or in prison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| He said, inasmuch as you did it to those, you did it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8713)|
| 2:25:20| Then those who had not said, well, when did we see you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| When did not minister to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| When did we not come to you in prison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| And it was those who had, and he said, inasmuch as you didn't do it, you didn't do it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8732)|
| 2:25:44| Now, I don't know what Jesus would have said about video cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| I just am not sure that that would have qualified as the kind of human contact that redeems people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| I am a counselor in private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| I'm licensed in psychology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| And I can tell you that study after study shows that people are redeemed, they're rehabilitated by human contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8761)|
| 2:26:12| I would like to invite you not only to visit prisons, but visit, as I did sitting here waiting to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8772)|
| 2:26:20| visit the website of Securus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| It has nothing in the whole website that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| The mission statement has nothing about helping people, helping human beings become more whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8788)|
| 2:26:35| It's all about control, about making money, and about law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8795)|
| 2:26:44| We all believe in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| We also believe that it must lead to redemption, even for those who are permanently imprisoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8807)|
| 2:26:57| that the imprisonment should lead to the ability to become more whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8817)|
| 2:27:03| So, yes, you may not have the option today to change this, but you are even more than the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8823)|
| 2:27:10| We all are part of this community, and therefore our sense of humanity, our sense of public concern, we have, each of us has individual power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8830)|
| 2:27:27| And you as commissioners have even more power to sway public opinion that this is not a good system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8847)|
| 2:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8858)|

| 2:27:55| Good evening. My name is Tina Sparks. I live at 612 Avenue A, Vestal 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8875)|
| 2:28:04| Thank you for letting me speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| I won't take up my whole five minutes. I don't have a whole lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| I am the sister of a person who was incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| I am the wife of a person who was incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8900)|
| 2:28:28| And I can only say that without human contact, without touch, feel, or touch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8908)|
| 2:28:38| eye contact, let me back up, 29 years, I taught kindergarten, 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8918)|
| 2:28:45| One of the things that I stressed with my babies all those 29 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| when you talk to someone, you look them in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| When you want to get to know someone, you reach out your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8938)|
| 2:29:10| You reach out your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| You cannot do that, either of those things, with a machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8955)|
| 2:29:22| I don't care what kind of machine it is. I do not have a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8962)|
| 2:29:28| I do not have a smart phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| I think a lot of people maybe don't have computers and don't have smart phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| That's all right, but we should still be able to have contact with our loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=8977)|

| 2:30:13| Someone has to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| You step up right now, and you say no to this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| and you say no to any other contracts, and you talk to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| I'm going to talk to the sheriff, and I'm going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9027)|
| 2:30:33| I don't care how many more employees you have to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| I'll pay whatever kind of tax I have to pay to get another person in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| so that you can make sure that nobody's bringing in things that they shouldn't bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9045)|
| 2:30:53| Well, that's what they're paid for, to do that, and they should just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| We had to go through all kinds of things here to come in to talk to you all tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| and I understand that. I understand that. I'm not a crazy person. I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9064)|
| 2:31:12| In the prisons, yes, that's fine. Hire more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9072)|
| 2:31:20| Machines are not the answer to everything. They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9080)|
| 2:31:26| They are not. They are not. You have to take pen to paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| Sit down and talk to someone. You have to be able to hug someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| You might be the only person all day that has personal contact with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9097)|
| 2:31:49| I'm sorry. I want to thank you all again for letting me talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| I want to thank Mr. McKenzie and Ms. Brawls over here for your support on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9114)|
| 2:32:06| And every one of you should be thinking about what would I do if I could not hug my baby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9126)|
| 2:32:15| hug my husband, kiss my brother, and say just if I had to do all that film machining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9135)|
| 2:32:22| I don't have the money for that machine. It's not right. That's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9142)|
| 2:32:29| It's very poor form. It is not right. And if you can't make it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9149)|
| 2:32:37| then how are we supposed to make it right? We trust you to help us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| We trust you to help us with this. And you say here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9163)|
| 2:32:51| well we can't speak to this and we can't speak to that. When are you going to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| It's been going on for too long. It's been going on for too long. My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9177)|

| 2:33:31| Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I hate you did that to me. That means I'm the sum up man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9211)|
| 2:33:38| My name is Harold Middlebrook. I reside at 2334 Dandridge Avenue, Knoxville, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9218)|
| 2:33:47| It is seldom that I come before this body because I believe that these are men and women of integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9227)|
| 2:33:55| of concern, and who seem to look out for the least, the lost, and the left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9235)|
| 2:34:02| But I raise some concerns because as I talk to people across this state and this nation, it seems to me that we are moving away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9242)|
| 2:34:14| incarcerating individuals for rehabilitation and moving to make it a profit-making entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9254)|
| 2:34:23| It seems that Securius, as I have read, is talking about how much they are going to give back to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9263)|
| 2:34:31| and to the county, and they give that money back to the county on the backs of those who are poor, who are left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9271)|
| 2:34:40| and who are lost because they cannot afford necessarily to afford an attorney to get their loved ones out of prison or out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9280)|
| 2:34:51| It seems to me that we ought not be talking about profit and who's going to give back what, but what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9291)|
| 2:35:01| To rehabilitate, to help those who have fallen. I am not one who is very technological. I admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9301)|
| 2:35:13| For years I kept a little regular cell phone that I really didn't want to have. But everybody kept saying to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9313)|
| 2:35:23| you need to get a smart phone. And so I made the investment to get a smart phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9323)|
| 2:35:30| Only to go out to AT&T, because my phone quit working, to have the people who operate technology to tell me that there was nothing they could do with that phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9330)|
| 2:35:46| and they would have to send me another phone in seven days. I have found that technology does not always work. And we need to understand that we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| take away the human touch, the human concern, and the feeling for all mankind. I'm not going to take my full five minutes, but I want to ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9353)|
| 2:36:12| Mr. Chairman, if the county commission cannot decide on what is going to happen, what is going to happen to the people who are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9372)|
| 2:36:22| affected? Why is this issue before you now, instead of in the sheriff's budget, if it is the sheriff's decision and the sheriff's policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9382)|
| 2:36:42| The reason it's before us is a contract would secure us to be approved by commission. We properly have before us a motion in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9402)|
| 2:36:52| second. Is there discussion? Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9412)|
| 2:36:58| Yes, I'm just going to make this quite short, and I want to thank everyone who came and spoke tonight, because I understand we're running behind for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9418)|
| 2:37:05| zonings, and that meeting looks like it might stretch on as well. Listening to some of the comments made and conversations that I've had, it seems that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9425)|
| 2:37:12| there's still a great deal of some confusion and misinformation regarding the contract video visits and also how an in-person visit works. So it's clear that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9432)|
| 2:37:27| obviously need to spend more time talking to one another. Although I agree that while I have not yet received any of the information I've requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9447)|
| 2:37:34| from the sheriff's department last Monday, but I'm certain that I'm going to be receiving that. I have looked at the available research regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9454)|
| 2:37:48| in-person visits versus video visits, and it is clear that banning personal visits are detrimental to the inmate, their families, and also to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| detention facility itself. And although I agree that this particular contract is better for Knox County as a whole than our previous contract, I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9475)|
| 2:38:10| voting no on this issue. And I hope my no vote, and the reason I'm casting my vote as no, is that it will help keep this issue in focus and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9490)|
| 2:38:25| under discussion. If there be no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. No. Two noes. Motion carries. Now, if there be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| objection, I would call for a brief recess of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9511)|
| 2:39:02| If there be no objection, we will move to zonings, for which Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9542)|
| 2:39:08| Madam Clerk will call the roll for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9548)|
| 2:39:39| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Now then, my fellow commissioners, there are four or five short items between where we are in commission and the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| department chief, Ms. Buchanan. Is Ms. Buchanan still here? She is. She's back there in the middle. I would propose that we sitting as zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9585)|
| 2:40:15| take a brief recess, reassemble at 740, and return to regular commission work to remove, to remedy the next five items, I think it is, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9615)|
| 2:40:34| short items, which will clear county employees that are waiting right at the moment. We are in recess. I would propose that we take a brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9634)|
| 2:40:45| recess, and return to regular commission work as the board of zoning. I'm going to call back to order Knox County Commission for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9645)|
| 2:40:56| moving through the agenda of Knox County Commission to Ms. Buchanan's presentation. I believe that's four items and one, that's four numbered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| Ms. Buchanan's presentation. I believe that's four items and one, that's four numbered items, four resolutions, and then Ms. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9662)|
| 2:41:25| So, so that everyone is aware, zoning is still in a brief recess. And what I have called to order is Knox County Commission. Setting is Knox County Commission, item 602. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9685)|
| 2:41:45| It's listed on page 11. It's a resolution approving a contract with Cherokee Health Systems for primary care services for children on TennCare or without health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9705)|
| 2:41:55| This item was not before us in completed form at the work session. I believe I had a motion to approve. And a second. All in favor. Aye. Say aye. Opposed. No. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9715)|
| 2:42:12| The next item is 801. Madam Clerk. Page 12. It's a resolution implementing the Knox County Fleet Safety Program to replace the Knox County Vehicle Use Policy effective February 1, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9732)|
| 2:42:27| Mr. Smith. Commissioner Smith. Because I work in risk management, there might be a possible conflict since I work on this. I'm going to abstain from this vote. And you will abstain. Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9747)|
| 2:42:40| Move to approve. Recuse. I've been told you need to recuse. Is that okay? Motion is properly before us. All in favor. Say aye. Aye. Opposed. No. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9760)|
| 2:42:57| Next item. Madam Clerk. Resolution 904. It's on page 14. It's approving a contract with ENA Services LLC, a subsidiary of Education Networks of America, Incorporated, for the provision of Internet service for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9777)|
| 2:43:14| The reason this item has been pulled is because there has been an appeal to commission questioning the validity of the contract. Would someone from Purchasing please approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9794)|
| 2:43:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Matt Myers, Knox County Purchasing, 1000 North Central Street. I'd just like to say that the process as dictated in our procurement code was followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9814)|
| 2:43:46| We had two subject matter experts in Purchasing evaluate the RFPs, and it wasn't a low bid, but it was a best value procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9826)|
| 2:43:59| This is due to a request being made of commission. This is not about the items of technicality that are in the contract, but was the contract process proper, and was the contract awarded properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9839)|
| 2:44:18| And I believe we've just had the question of that. Is there any other discussion? Motion to approve. Motion is properly before us. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9858)|
| 2:44:36| Dr. Buchanan. I appreciate your being here with us at this hour. Your presentation please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9876)|
| 2:44:53| Dr. Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue. Thank you for the opportunity to present our latest community health assessment to the commission. The community health assessment is really the state of the state of health in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9893)|
| 2:45:09| There's a lot of information in there, and I encourage you to look at it, and please ask us questions if you have questions. Collecting data and using it to educate people and inform people and inform decisions is something we do every day, but every few years we take the big picture look and look at the health of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9909)|
| 2:45:29| This information will be used by the community health council in the next step to create a community health improvement plan, focusing on the things that the community health council says are the most important things for us to focus on around health over the next five years. And I'll be bringing another one of these to you, or other commissioners probably, in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9929)|
| 2:45:51| So I really encourage you to look at it and ask me questions. This is a tool we want our community to use when making decisions related to health, and sometimes even decisions not related to health, because health is really multifactorial, as you can see in this book. So if you have any questions, you can ask me now or reach out to me later and we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9951)|
| 2:46:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, as I looked at this, and it's well put together, and I do appreciate that, but the disparity amongst white, African American is extreme, you know, and I'm not saying that it's not mirrored in other communities, but I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9972)|
| 2:46:38| So I would just hope that as you start again to put together those remedies and those teams, that we'll look at the stark difference in terms of health and the overall health, not just things like diabetes and mobility, but, you know, in terms of a lot of the other things that you point out in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=9998)|
| 2:47:03| So hopefully this will be a great dialogue to start some real substantial changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| Yes, I think among other community members and leaders as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10029)|
| 2:47:15| Thank you for your presentation, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| Now, so that you do not get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| There's one more discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| No, there are at least two other discussion items and announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10049)|
| 2:47:35| Unless there is an objection, I will call a brief recess of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10055)|
| 2:47:45| If there be no objection, I call a brief recess of county commission, and we will resume zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10065)|
| 2:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| Zoom away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| There's more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10083)|
| 2:48:08| So you got your zoning hat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10088)|
| 2:48:23| We have been called from recess to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10103)|
| 2:48:32| The zoning's, excuse me, let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| There are some sector plan changes in tonight's zoning business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10117)|
| 2:48:45| When we come upon a sector plan change, if the sector plan change is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10125)|
| 2:48:53| I will move immediately to the rezoning associated with that sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10133)|
| 2:49:04| with the exception of sector plan change 11E15SP, which is on page 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10144)|
| 2:49:18| That's 11E15SP on page 17 will be moved immediately prior to 11J15RZ on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10158)|
| 2:49:34| And for those that do not recognize all those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| presentation on Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10179)|
| 2:49:47| I would assume, without objection from those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| that those people that have signed up to speak as a part of public input on individual sector plans or zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10191)|
| 2:50:01| would like to speak at the time of that particular sector plan or zoning being worked upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10201)|

| 3:00:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| The request is for rezoning of approximately 6.33 acre parcel on the northeast side of Schaefer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10836)|
| 3:00:43| There were comments received from adjoining property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| largely in the form of e-mails expressing concern regarding the proposed five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10846)|
| 3:00:52| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended rezoning at a density of three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10852)|
| 3:00:58| to be compatible with the adjacent properties and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| The property, approximately half of it has a slope of 15 to 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| and the lower density would also be in compliance with the recommendations of the Hillside Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10867)|
| 3:01:14| If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| One final item, the recommendation of rezoning to three dwelling units per acre from MPC was a unanimous vote on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10878)|
| 3:01:28| Consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10888)|

| 3:01:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| I agree to accept MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10903)|

| 3:01:53| Per MPC recommendation, there is a motion properly before us to approve this rezoning as recommended by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10913)|

| 3:03:11| Mr. McClure, the applicant, is here and his surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| The recommendation of the Metropolitan Planning Commission was to amend the Northwest Sector Plan to LDR for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11008)|
| 3:03:35| It's approximately, I don't have the acreage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| 19.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11021)|
| 3:03:42| 19.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| The vote was 8-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| There was some discussion on this because the property is located in the rural area of the growth policy plan, which would limit the density to 3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11027)|
| 3:03:57| Because of that recommendation of the growth policy plan or mandate of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11037)|
| 3:04:03| you'll note that the recommendation for the rezoning was for 3 units per acre as opposed to the request from the applicant for a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11043)|
| 3:04:14| The Planning Commission felt that was a reasonable compromise to allow the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11054)|
| 3:04:19| but to recommend a lower density for the property than the 4 units requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11059)|
| 3:04:32| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| To the applicant, this is somewhat different from what requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11077)|
| 3:04:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| No, the sector plan is what we requested and we are, I think, in agreement with MPC on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11085)|
| 3:04:52| Our disagreement comes on the density for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11092)|
| 3:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| Seeing no further discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| Motion to approve for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| Seeing no other lights, the motion is properly before us to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11108)|
| 3:05:15| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11119)|
