| 0:08:27| ma'am, and give your name and address for the record, you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Good afternoon. My name is Kim Loth. I live at 117| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=511)|

| 0:08:39| I'm the president of the League of Women Voters for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Knox County. As the commission has plans today to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| commissioner travel, I'm here to speak on behalf of the League of Women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Voters on this matter. The League was obviously disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| when learning through an article published in the Knoxville News Sentinel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Commissioner Smith's comments regarding Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Broyle's missing a scheduled meeting to attend the Tennessee Economic Summit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| for Women. The League finds Commissioner Smith's lack of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| on this issue as further demonstrated by what he deemed an apology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| at last week's commission work session, both offensive and troublesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| This entire incident has been mislabeled a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| women's issue. My comments today are not about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| that Commissioner Broyles is the lone woman on the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| or about the fact that the conference she attended was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Economic Summit for Women. This is not a woman's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| It's an issue of good government and should be considered within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| framework. Commissioner Broyles did not miss a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| meeting to attend to Quiltingby. She correctly understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| that continuing education is best practiced for virtually every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| industry, including public service. She further understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| that the topic of the Economic Summit, the fact that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| $800 million is spent annually on violence against women in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| our state impacts every taxpayer in Tennessee regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| of gender. I cannot speak to Commissioner Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| intent, and my personal interactions with him have been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| However, these statements and the subsequent statement he made at last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| week's work session under the guise of an apology do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| nothing to serve the citizens of Knox County. Whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| it is in business or in government, research has repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| shown that outcomes are better when there is gender-balanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| leadership. Portraying our community as one where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| issues of large-scale impact can be dismissed as women's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| issues, or where a lone female commissioner appears to be the target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| of a personal vendetta, or where the values of continuing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| for county commissioners is as a whole questioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| is not only inconsistent with the values of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| it may very well diminish us in the eyes of the very people and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| we're trying to attract. The League of Women Voters of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| Knoxville-Knox County would like to encourage the commission to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| on this issue with a focus on good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Commissioners do have an obligation to be educated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| informed. The commission should provide a framework and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| budget that would allow this to happen. And further, the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| should value gender-balanced leadership for the positive outcomes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| created when we all have a seat at the table. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Ms. Louth, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Next on the list is Jay Duane Craigio. I hope I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| pronounced that one correctly. Name and address for the record, and you have five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| minutes, please. My name is Jay Duane Craigio, and I'm the Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| Director of the East Tennessee Hearing Loss Group. I live at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| 9123 Wood Park Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| 37923. First of all, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| give the county commission thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. I know there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| not a great deal that the county commission can do about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| other than give me an opportunity to speak of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| Across the state of Tennessee, there's something like approaching 300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Tennesseans. In Knox County alone, something close to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| 55,000 Tennesseans that suffer from hearing loss every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| day. And currently, the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| does provide hearing loss benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| for children under the age of 18, $1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| every three years for hearing aids. I just think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| something more needs to be done because hearing loss is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| that progresses with age. I mean, I do understand the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| of giving children hearing aids so they can hear well in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| but the older population is being left out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| equation. I mean, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| levity of the situation, every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| I hear people walking through stores or whatever with difficulty hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| My wife, Susan, she's hearing impaired, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| see the struggles that she has every day, and I know it's a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| problem. I worked for a year with the VA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| and audiological services and seen the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| that it made on the older adults that had access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| hearing aid benefits, audiological services, that they were no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| afraid to talk on the phone, was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| longer afraid to carry on a conversation in public or be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| ridiculed to ask somebody a question because they knew that they probably were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| not going to hear what they had to say. To me, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| is just disheartening to know that there's that big of a population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| within the state of Tennessee that suffers from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| hearing loss, and truly nothing is being done at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| I do realize that the cost of hearing aids range anywhere between $1,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| to $6,800 for a pair of hearing aids, and that cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| oftentimes is a burden to where people just can't afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| It's not as simple as going out to, say, a store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| if you're vision impaired. Glasses don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| quite cost that much, and I do understand that some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| mandates as far as trying to get payment for hearing aids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| would be a stretch to accomplish, but they should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| treated equally as other people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| That's all I really wanted to say, was to make people aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| that there is this issue and we're going to be moving forward with this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| trying to see if we can make a change for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Tennessean that is hearing impaired, not just the children. And once again, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| thank you all for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| I think this is probably, and thank you for coming, Mr. Cargill, I think this is probably, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| probably an issue for the state through TennCare and things like that, but we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| next time we meet with Representative Haynes and the delegation, we'll remind them that you came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| before us. Well, I've got a couple of meetings scheduled with some representatives and senators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| in the near future to bring this situation to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| but at least I did want to come here and let people know that it is a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| and once again, I do appreciate the opportunity. Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you. Thank you. I have a few others on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Commissioner, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| I was just going to ask if maybe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| you and I could get together in a couple of weeks. There's some contacts that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| here in town since I do some work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| or one of the issues that I focus on are individuals in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| community with disabilities. So there may be some people that I can put you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| in touch with to help do some networking to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| get more of this message out and maybe, of course, when you go meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| our state legislatures, there's power in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| numbers. That is correct. So hopefully maybe you and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| connect over the next couple of weeks. I'd be more than happy to do that, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Broyles. Thank you, ma'am. I have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| folks on the list that want to speak in regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| Old Knoxville High School. Bill Murrah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| You want to speak at the time that we discuss the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Okay. And Virginia Douglas? You want to speak at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| we discuss that issue? Okay. Any others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| before for public forum prior to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| My name is Jennifer Mertes. I live at 606 Hines Court. And I'm here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| to basically defend Larry. I know what he said in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Came across wrong. And I am all for women's rights. And, you know, I very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| much love your league. But to keep the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| going, to make it, you know, going against his character. I've known this man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| for ten years. And he is not anything against women or women's rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| or women's issues. He is for it. Now, have we all put our foot in our mouths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| at one time or another? Yeah. I don't think there's a person in this room that can't say that they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| But he did come forward and apologize. But what I've been seeing is still more attacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| going on. And it's unjust. It's not right. And the public attacks are coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| her personal Facebook pages. And she knows he's not affiliated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| Facebook. So, therefore, she can go through and still attack Mr. Smith and think that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| OK. And I'm sorry, but I'm standing here today because I very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| like County Commissioner Smith. I think he does a fantastic job for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| I've worked with him in numerous organizations, numerous charity works. And he does a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| fantastic job. Never once have I ever seen him portray a woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| or women's issues as not being important. And so I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| come forward today and state my peace on that. Thank you for what you do, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Can you give us your name and address again? I'm sorry, Ms. Mertes. Jennifer Mertes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| 606 Hines Court. That's H-E-I-N-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| All right. It is 156.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| The law director says we have to adjourn for four minutes and start back at two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1103)|

| 0:19:33| recognizing November 2013 as Epilepsy Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1173)|

| 0:19:41| Moved and properly seconded. Hearing discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1181)|

| 0:19:57| the mayor's office and the commission office wanted to take this time to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| the Epilepsy Foundation and the work that they do locally here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| And Mr. Brown, if you'd come forward and say some words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| I'd appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you, members of the commission. My name is Bill Brown. I'm the president of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Epilepsy Foundation of East Tennessee. The foundation serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| approximately 43,000 people in East Tennessee who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| epilepsy and seizure disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Probably around 10,000 or more in Knox County people suffer from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| seizures, loss of consciousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| falling down, shaking. Epilepsy is the fourth leading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| neurological disorder in the country. Migraine, stroke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Alzheimer's, and then epilepsy. Epilepsy is underserved. It's underfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| It's underrecognized. So we appreciate this proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| as to the awareness of epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| There is Epilepsy Awareness Month, and that's why we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| to make the community aware of epilepsy, how to treat it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| how to offer first aid, and also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| recognize the people that suffer from epilepsy and need assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Briefly, the foundation provides services to the epileptics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and those who suffer from seizure disorder. They provide medicine, emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| help, support group. One of the main activities of the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| is to provide helmets for tens of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| of children, bicycle helmets they can wear. It's a preventative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| measure. So when there's a bicycle accident, they don't have a head injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Head injuries are a leading cause of epilepsy and seizures. So one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| the main activities is prevention and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| referrals to doctors, whatever services the people who suffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| from epilepsy and seizure disorders in the county need. It's the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Way Agency, and it serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| a community that is in need of help and assistance. I'm with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| Michelle Carringer. Do you have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| I never have anything to say. I just want to say it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| an honor for me to serve on this board, and my big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| reasoning is our bike helmets that we hand out to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| We go to the Boys and Girls Club in several areas. So if anybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| listening today or here today that have a need where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| there are several children that you would like for us to come out, measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| It's very important that they have the correct size helmet that a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| parents or grandparents may not realize that you've got to have the right size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| helmet and that it fits in the right way to prevent an injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| And how so many people are unaware about how epilepsy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| does occur. You're not born| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| with epilepsy. It's not a disease. And as I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| out and speak about it, I'm amazed at how I have so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| adults come up and say, I never knew that. I thought that was something that people were born with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| So the key to everything is educating everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| and we certainly want to keep everybody safe. So all the skate parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| all that you drive by, if you ever get a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| just to take a minute and say, you know, where's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| your helmet? And there is a law for this. But as always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| if they're under 18, that comes down to the parents. So it's kind of hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| to make that law really stick. So if you're in need of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| helmets, let us know. We'll be glad to give you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| I think the next thing on the agenda would be the devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Would you bow your heads and pray with me, please? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Father God, hallowed be your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| We have great privilege to live where we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| In this great country and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| and county, thank you for this day, this beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| beautiful fall day. We're truly blessed by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I pray for this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| and for all the employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Help us to have courage, wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| and patience in what we do and what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| And help us to rest, also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| from our fretful strivings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| sometimes. And help us to rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| in the knowledge that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| sovereign and you have dominion over all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| In your holy and precious name, Lord. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Dr. Briggs, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=1493)|

| 0:39:55| the 114? Who picked the 114, audit or personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| That was a discussion with the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| I didn't know, are you done with that portion of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Yeah, I would like to know how we came up with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| The reason that we came up with that number was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| the top two candidates both are currently making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| approximately $110,000 and we felt that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| difficult to ask someone to leave a job that they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| and make a sideways move if there was not also some kind of financial benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| to that. We had initially talked about the next step up was $112,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| and that just an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| $2,000 perhaps was not adequate and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| the next step above that was $114,000. So that's how we arrived at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| that particular number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Commissioner Hammond? I mean, is this the same issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| No, I was not able to come when they interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| the candidates, but I've been following the information. But I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| hear from both candidates that are here. I'd just like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| hear their vision for the job and how they see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| and that type of thing. If we could give them maybe two or three minutes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| Is that what you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Okay, so if we're through talking about that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| I guess this is just more of a question. I was not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| as well and, again, I always try to let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| committees do their work. But I guess I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| have a question. I guess during the course of that dialogue there was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| candidate that I know he's done work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| for the county. He's done an excellent job. I know the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| finance director, John Troyer, kind of sung his praises and I was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| pleasantly surprised when Mr. Osborne was a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| for this position. So I'm just wondering why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| I guess that's a general question. I mean, since we're making hiring, I'll ask the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| why his name? Was there something inappropriate with the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| He seemed to be eminently qualified to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| a finalist, unless I missed something there. So I see Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Shouse's light came on. So thank you. I'll respond as best I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Mr. McKenzie. The gentleman was an impressive person. He had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| done some contract work for Knox County. I think the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| examiner's audit he was involved in, bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| line, and it influenced my decision, he had not done actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| other than that medical examiner's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| he had not done any really auditing function. He had not performed the auditing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| function for any entity in about 20 years. He was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| a financial advisor now, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| sells insurance and investment products and so forth like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| that. So of the three or the four we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| ranked, I think I can be fairly correct in saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| he came in third simply because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| if you're auditing right now like these two ladies are or you did something 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| ago, that's sort of how it came out as it did. He was an impressive gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| and I'm glad we interviewed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| We came to the conclusion it would be best to recommend the two top come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Commissioner Burroughs. I also wanted to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| that there were a number of, and I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| it here, I was going to find it and show it to you. There was a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| documents, documentation that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| asked to be submitted to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| before the interview process and the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| candidates that we recommended were the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| two who turned in everything we asked for and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| that was actually, I was very impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| with the third candidate and very intrigued with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| some of the things that he had to say about revamping the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| and doing things differently, but it did boil down for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| to what Ed just mentioned that it had been quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| but also he only turned in one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| I believe the five documentation things that we had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| So it was difficult to put him ahead of two other people who had done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| exactly what they had been asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| Commissioner Burroughs, did you say you were looking for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| matrix of... I've got it if someone needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| I have it also that I have to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| a lot of credit to the people and personnel for coming up with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| form and checking all the documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| certifications and memberships for which we were required to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| a viable candidate and the two that are here today with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| are the two that got across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| The final two are not on my packet I have up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| They're in the file at the house. Who are the final two candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Just give me their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| And what, Kington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Is there any other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| in regards to how we got to where we're at today before we hear from the two candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| Can Ms. Kington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2749)|
| 0:46:03| We'll need your name and address just for the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| My name is Cindy Kington. My address is 3478 Heathcliff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| and I live in Morristown, Tennessee. I am a property owner in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| Knoxville. We hope to move one of these days when we sell our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| If you would, just a brief for the commissioners that weren't at the interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| just an overview, maybe three or four minutes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| where you're at and how the process went for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| I've been with TVA just a little over three years. I came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| I'm the Director of Distributor Compliance, Eastern Region at TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Our group does compliance assessments of the local power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| companies throughout the valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| It's a contract compliance. We assess against the TVA power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| contract. Before coming to TVA, I was Director of Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Audit at Walter State Community College, which is a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| community college in Morristown. There I was in charge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| comprehensive internal audit program. I reported to the system-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Director of Internal Audit in Nashville. I did all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| sorts of work with Walter State, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| we did an enterprise-wide risk assessment during my tenure there. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| about a four-year process. We looked at all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| risks, not just the financial risks, but all the operational risks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Walter State had. We assessed the controls that were in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| against those risks. We looked for control gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| and put some additional internal controls in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| place to mitigate those. Prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| to that, I was a controller at a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| I've spent some time in public accounting. I also spent some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| when my children were young, I operated a small sole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| proprietor accounting practice out of my home for a while. So I've kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| got a diverse background. I've done a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| I love being a public servant, and I would very much like to be the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| Internal Auditor. Commissioner Brown. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Mr. Chairman. Ms. Kington, I'm going to ask the same question to both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| What is your relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| with Dr. Carsello? Dr. Carsello,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| I don't know him at all. I met him for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| when he interviewed me the other day. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Commissioner Hammond. A couple of questions, and thank you for your interest and thank you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| willingness to serve. How do you see this office? What is your vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| for the office? Just your thoughts about it. Okay. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| philosophical view is that internal audit should be a partner with management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| We should be right there at the table making sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| objectives of the organization are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Internal audit is there to ensure that everyone is following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| the rules. Everyone is doing everything according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| the manager's expectations. It should not be an adversarial relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| We should be partners totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| Let me ask you this. You will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| under the microscope by accepting this position because you will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| in the public eye, and any work that you do will be in the newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| which you probably don't get that where you are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| with that level of scrutiny. If someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| if you were to detect that someone was not doing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| they were supposed to be doing, I guess what I'm looking for is I'm looking for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| who has the courage to stand up and say, we've got to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| because this doesn't appear right. This doesn't pass the smell test, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| of who that person is, regardless of their political clout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| regardless of any, if you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| and your expertise says we've got some issues and we need to delve into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| would you have the courage to do that? Oh, absolutely. In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| to being a CPA, I'm also a certified fraud examiner, and I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| not come about that certification by accident. I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| a couple of situations where I have detected fraud, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| one big case at the college, I won't go into any details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| but I had to see that through all the way. We got two criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| indictments. So, yes, I have done that in the past. I also detected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| a case that another employer at a non-profit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| saw that through completely. We got an indictment there. So, yes, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| the courage. I've proven myself twice already on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you. Quick question. Sort of along the same lines of what he was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| I feel the same way. You're going to have office holders that want to buddy up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| and six months, they may go out to eat quite a bit, and the next thing you know, you might find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| something out somewhere. We need to know that you're going to have the courage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| if you find something, to take care of that. You said you were certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| some sort of an examiner. What was the certified what? Certified fraud examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| Fraud examiner. Okay. And then the non-profit that you worked at, I know what your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| is at TVA. What kind of budget did you work for this non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Oh, my goodness. It's been a while. Probably no more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| five million. It was a small non-profit. Was it based here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| in Knoxville or Morristown? Morristown. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| Any other questions, Mr. Kington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| This is not a question, but to give you a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| insight into the depth at which the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| talked with the candidates, I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| congratulate her on the fact that she raised a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Yes. My daughter is a teacher at Sarah Moore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| Okay. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Thank you, Ms. Kington. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| Ms. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| Good afternoon. What is your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Andrea Williams, 122 South Gay Street, number 401,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| If you would, just kind of the same thing Ms. Kington did, just kind of give us a brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| overview, please. Sure. I have spent my entire career at TVA. I am currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| the senior manager of compliance advisory support for the compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| office. I handle all of the back office audit functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| such as training and development, our process manuals to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| they're compliant with IIA standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| workforce development, our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| our IT support, anything, our board communications packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| anything that's kind of the back house that supports our chief audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| executive. Previously at TVA, I have worked in the distributor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| compliance area, and I've worked for the inspector general's office in various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| functions. I have experience in financial and operational audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| Sarbanes-Oxley compliance distributor, and now in the back office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| function of running an audit shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| I guess the same question, Chairman Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| Yes. Your vision for the office, again, you don't have a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| staff, but what is your vision for that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| I don't think you need a large staff to make a big impact, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| So definitely, repeating what Cindy said, audit is a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| It involves engaging management, engaging the stakeholders, making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| an audit department fully knows the risks across the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| and that the audit committee and the commission would be comfortable with the coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| It should be driven not only from information from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| but also information gathered from the audit group itself in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| engagements with our stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| And I guess the other thing, too, is I just want to reiterate again is what I'm looking for is someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| who is going to, regardless of political pressure, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| of personalities, et cetera, et cetera, when you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| at Knox County over the last few years, we've seen some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| that shouldn't have gone on. I'm looking for an auditor that, if they detect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| those things, will not hesitate to come forward and say, we've got to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| at this, regardless of where the chips may fall. Absolutely. And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| something that I'm completely comfortable with. That's our responsibility as auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| and to the public in this position. My experience with the Inspector General's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| office is also very public. Our reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| are given to Congress and they're made public. So every report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| that I issued, I made sure that if anyone picked it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| that it was completely factual and I could stand behind it. So it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| necessarily a political conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| at that point, but that it was factually correct and that the information was accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| to the public. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll ask you the same question I asked Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Kington. What's your relationship with Dr. Carsello? Dr. Carsello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| was a professor of mine in the master's program at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| when I was, that was 12 years ago. He was the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| core professor in my main class. I was a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| concentration, so I did not have any additional classes with him. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| the last time I saw him was at graduation until Thursday when I went to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| interview at the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| when he was the chair. Okay, thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Smith. Andrew, I've had in the past, I've gone to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| audit committee and asked, or not the committee, but to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| auditor in the past and some things I wanted to check into. And if I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| not correct on some, I did not want it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| If I was wrong, I was wrong. And I specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| asked it not, don't want, check the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| and if I'm right, I'm right. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. Within 20, both times, within 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| hours, it was all over the courthouse. Can we as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| if we want you or the mayor, if somebody wants you to check something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| can we have confidentiality with you that until the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| is done and the findings are done, that everything will be confidential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Yes, I think that trust, maintaining that trust is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| to be a partnership, you have to have the trust. And if you break the trust, then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| no longer have a working partnership between the commission or any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| stakeholder and the audit group. So I think maintaining that trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| is the most important aspect of maintaining a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| partnership. And if you will, just go over your certifications again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| She talked about hers. Go over yours. I have a Master's of Accountancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| in Taxation and I also have a, I'm a Certified Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Auditor. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| Any other questions of Ms. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Commissioner Brolles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Yes, one thing that I asked you specifically about at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| at the interview that I think bears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| repeating is I had asked you when we were talking about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| this can be a very public or it is a very public job and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| have you ever been on the hot seat before and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| you handled that and what kind of experience you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| dealing with that sort of thing. And you gave a very good answer. So I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| hoping that you could repeat that for the commissioners. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| Ms. Brolles had asked me how I handle being in the hot seat and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| example was I work with, I in my past have worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| TVA's power distributors and we would go in and audit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| distributors for compliance with their power contract. And I went into one distributor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| who was not happy with TVA and not happy that I was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| and it was a very difficult situation where it was very hard to get information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| but on top of that they were also conveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| to other power distributors that I was there and presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| a negative image of my office and of the work we were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| and the best way that I could handle that and I was getting calls from the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| it was a lot of information going on at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| and what I said was at the time and in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| situation I handled myself to maintain the best image for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| myself and for TVA because that's who I'm representing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| just like in that situation going forward I represent the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| and I'm going to handle myself in the best possible way to maintain my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| professionalism and my employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| Mr. Wright. Thank you Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| Chairman. Again out of my notes a couple of points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| I believe it was Commissioner Shouse asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| question is where does most of Knox County's money go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| the respondent was to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| other comment that I want to make alludes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Dr. Carsello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| I believe he was asked, you're not in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and I don't think he remembered you so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| there's no connection to Dr. Carsello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| The other thing that I want to make comment to was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| repeated question that Dr. Carsello did ask and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| how did the candidates prepare for the interview and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| your response was you had looked at the consolidated or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| CAFR you had also noticed there were repeated findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| and there was some question of segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| All very good answers for the questions asked. Thank you Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| Chairman. Commissioner Burles. Yes I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| was going to mention the same thing that Dave did that we asked all the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| what they had done to prepare and this candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| was the only one who had looked through the CAFR and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| also mentioned that the majority of our money goes through the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| and identified areas that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| looked into areas of risk that have not been addressed previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| and I also want to say we also gave the candidates an opportunity to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| us questions about what they expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| from us and their position and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| both of them, both of these candidates asked us excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| thoughtful questions so both of them were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| very outstanding in the kind of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| that they asked us during the interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Okay. Thank you ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Appreciate it. According to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| the commission rule would be that we take nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| and then we'll go first round of voting if no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Okay I just have one question. Did we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| recommendation from the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| What would that recommendation be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| We recommended, we decided to put forward both names, both candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Ms. Williams and Ms. Kington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| and we ranked them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| we ranked Ms. Williams first and Ms. Kington second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| but we felt that they were both strong enough candidates to bring them both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| We'll follow the commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| we'll take nominations beginning in the first district and then if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| no one gets six we'll continue the process until someone does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3715)|
| 1:02:03| Are we going around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| Commissioner McKenzie? Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Commissioner McKenzie passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Commissioner Burroughs? I'm going to nominate Ms. Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| she had the unanimous high vote of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| every member of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Commissioner Burroughs nominates Ms. Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| Commissioner Norman? Pass. Commissioner Norman passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| Commissioner Ornby? Pass. Commissioner Ornby passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| Commissioner Briggs? I'm going to put out Ms. Kington's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| name just so we have the two names out there so we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| Commissioner Briggs nominates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Ms. Kington. I hear a motion to nomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| I move. Second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| And so we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| Ms. Kington and Ms. Williams starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3787)|

| 1:03:43| Commissioner Smith? Williams. Commissioner Smith votes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Ms. Williams. Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Commissioner Wright votes for Ms. Williams. Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3831)|

| 1:04:03| Commissioner Shouse votes for Ms. Williams. Chairman, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| to change my vote to Williams. Make it unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| Commissioner Ornby changes to Ms. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| All right. With a unanimous vote of 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| Ms. Williams will be the new Knox County Auditor. Ms. Andrea Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| Mark, can she see you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| the process and about getting everything taken care of? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| In fact, that was going to be a question. I guess when do we start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| You want to start on the next pay period? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| Okay. Well, we need to make a vote on the resolution. We've picked a name to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| in the resolution. We need to vote on the resolution. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| or I need a motion to approve. Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Now, congratulations. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| Burles. Yes, I just wanted to also thank Ms. Kington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| for being an excellent, excellent candidate. This was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| I'll tell you what, we had a really great discussion at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| Audit Committee meeting. All the candidates were incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| impressive. So, thank you so much for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| and putting yourself forward for this. We truly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| But I also wanted to ask, do we need to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| on the salary as a commission? You just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| Oh, okay. So that's going to be it. All right. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| Mr. Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just would like to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| between now and hopefully the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| next meeting, I would like to meet with the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| so that we can put down some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| fresh rules and regulations regarding communications and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| job descriptions and so forth relating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| to the Audit Committee so that Ms. Williams starts off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| fresh on the right foot. Commissioner Wright. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| Chairman. And as Commissioner Burles was saying, thank you to the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| I want to re-express thanks to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| two that are here today, but also to Mr. Edwin Osborne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| for his appearing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| willingness to be a public servant because I view the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| internal auditor as being more than just a job. It's someone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| is looking for trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| help Knox County as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| public servant. And so, again, thanks to Mr. Osborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Commissioner McKenzie. Thank you for those words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| Commissioner Wright, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| dug in a little bit the last time he worked for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| and, again, John Troy is someone that I think everyone respects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| a great deal. Had nothing but kind words to say about Mr. Osborne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| so maybe he can stay involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| Commissioner Brown, I think, is actually the chair of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| Rules Committee and I sit on that committee so whenever you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| set a meeting, we'd be glad to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| I agree that this isn't going to be an easy job. As you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| say, some things you think you're going to make a simple decision and when you read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| about it in the paper, it's going to sound a little different than your simple decision and you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| have to unscrew all kinds of things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| misnomers, some true, some not. So good luck with that. I'm sure you have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| of experience with that with a major entity like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| TVA, but I do think it's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| to get a fresh start and, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| I'll use that term again, that if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| everyone stay within their lanes, we need to establish what those lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| are. Let's establish those lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| and then we can get Mr. Williams off to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| good, strong start. And at the end of the day, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| we're trying to do is to assure our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| the county taxpayers, that business is being done properly within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| the county side of this city-county building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| so we should be in great shape once that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| Commissioner Shouse. Thank you to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| commissioners for handling this professionally and we put a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| time into it and I think we, as has been said, had good candidates come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| with Mr. Osmond, it was maybe an experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| factor and how many years ago he was handling, he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| actually doing audits. And I think it's a good idea what Commissioner Brown has put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| We did discuss this a little bit with each of the candidates last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| how the, if you go back four years, five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| the internal auditor had 19 bosses and often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| it was a situation that politics dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| with, determined where people were sent as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| as practicality and as much as trying to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| improprieties and where things had disappeared in government. And, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| I think we've, with the audit committee, taking orders from the full committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| full commission, excuse me, I think we have taken a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| that out of, I'm referring to some things, the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| mayor and the people trying to get at him for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| I look, we mentioned this to the ladies and the gentlemen as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| interviewed, but I hope we can handle this, I hope this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| will be more professionally run and effective and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| the production that we need come forward from it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| also that it's run proactively instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| reactively. We also discussed that. The independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| auditor needs to be truly that, independent and do things on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| not everything at the direction of us. Everything's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| by us. There's a possibility for manipulation. So by them being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| independent, I think we can move forward and find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| and truly make our government run more efficiently and productively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you. Commissioner Hammond. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that as we get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| off on the right foot and as a new day is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| dawning here, I think it's important that Ms. Williams have input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| into when we talk about classifications, jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| descriptions, that type of thing, because for us to dictate to her how it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| going to be, she's bringing expertise to the table. And I think that we need to have her at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| to get her input on how the office is to be structured and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| the reporting procedures and communications is supposed to be handled. So, Ms. Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| we look forward to having you on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| Commissioner Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we round this up, I'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| on behalf of the Audit Committee, I appreciate you handling this item first on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| agenda. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| We beat that one to death. Let's go on to the one that's not going to be so difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| 802. On page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4275)|

| 1:11:47| We're going to hear a second. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| All right. We have three people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| Virginia Douglas, if you would come forward and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| You'll have five minutes when you get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4323)|
| 1:12:17| My name is Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Virginia Douglas. I live in Forstengill neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| but I'm a property owner in Old North Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I need your full address, ma'am. Your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| 918 Gratz Street. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| I've been studying this issue and I've been vacillating back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| on it as I read and as I talk to people. And I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| that there's been a great deal of controversy over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| the project which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| accepted. And I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| when we look at the true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| area that that is in, that the use it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| used for will be a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| The buildings around it are not retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| There are very few retail businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| which is one of the big things when these people say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| that everybody in the building will be staying in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| and not supporting local enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| There are not a lot of local enterprises there to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| And as I'm sure, because this is dealing with people of my age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| I'm sure that when new stores and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| new restaurants do come into the area, they will appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| to this group and, yeah, we will go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| and we will see what the new stores and everything are out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| But I think at this point that it is a good use and should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| accepted. Thank you, Ms. Douglas. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| taking your time to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| Next on the list, Bill Murrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| Mr. Murrow, if you would give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| For the record, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Okay. My name is Bill Murrow, M-U-R-R-A-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| That's my whole name. I always have to spell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| 1111 Gratz Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I'm a neighbor of Virginia's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| I've been a resident of the Fourth and Gill Neighborhood for 41 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| And I'm currently on the Board of Directors of the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| I am not here representing the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| I'm here speaking only for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| And I did speak before the workshop last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| So I'm going to try to change my comments so that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| bore people to death who were here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| But I did want to point out, say something that was the same as I said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| I didn't have any opinion about who would win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| the result of your RFP and evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| It really wasn't that important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| What was most important was that the building was going to get fixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| You know, the building has been mostly empty for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| And to have it renovated up to historic standards is something that's important for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| But at our last board meeting of the Fourth and Gill Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| we had presentations by the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| And the developer who was not being recommended pointed out to our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| that he thought that your RFP, the county's RFP and evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| he thought it was not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| So all of a sudden, I'm a board member of the Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| and that all of a sudden struck me quite strongly that it was incumbent upon me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| to try to determine was your process fair or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| And all of a sudden, I began to dig into it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| So I went to your county purchasing office and talked to one of the staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| I talked to the staff at the community design center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| because they helped with some of the community input into this evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| And I spoke with both the developer that your process recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| and the developer who is not being recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| I spoke to people in their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And all of them agreed without fail about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| Number one, the county's RFP and evaluation process was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| All these folks agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| I asked them the same question, and they all said it was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| And the second thing they said is the reason that the Dewhurst proposal did not win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| was when your evaluation process asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| how much money are you going to pay the county for the building, he put zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| And so he got zero points for zero dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| And the winning recommended developer received points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| because they offered the county $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Well, you know, there's some sense to that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| So it seemed to me that since there was consensus that the process was fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| that I would suggest that you honor your process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| unless someone has a criticism that I personally haven't heard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| But I did want to mention there have been some talk about some opposition in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| to the future, the proposed use of the building as senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| And I might say right off the bat that that sort of touches a little bit of a nerve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| because I live in senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| It's called my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| I just came, you know, recently off a 50-mile backpacking trip on the Appalachian Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| so I'm one of those frail seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| So people who say that seniors are not active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| I don't know if you've been to the mall and seen who all those people are walking around the malls for exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| It's not 14-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| You know, it's seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| I think the best way to deal with problems of any kind of crime in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| people said it was going to be heightened crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| You know, give 25 seniors in that building binoculars and ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| report anything they see that's suspicious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| and give them your phone number and see if your phone isn't lit up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| And the crime will be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| I wanted to just speak to another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| Virginia mentioned about the impact on businesses around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| One of the criticisms has been that if seniors live in that housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| it will somehow harm the businesses surrounding the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| Right now there are no zero dollars coming out of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| If you have 100 seniors living in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| and they have, say, $5,000 disposable income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| or extra income above their rent, food, et cetera, et cetera, to spend, hypothetically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| you're talking about a half a million dollars of new money being generated out of that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| that's going to be spent somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Now, if business people can't figure out how to capture that half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| that's not a problem with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| It's not a problem with the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| It's a problem with the lack of imagination of business people in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| Mr. Moreau, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| If you'd wrap it up, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Finally, I'll just say one thing in passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| The profile of seniors that we're talking about income-wise is my personal profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| My wife is about to retire after teaching school in Knox County for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| Her Knox County pension plus her Social Security will put her right in the middle of the income guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| that will qualify for housing in an old Knoxville high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Commissioner McKenzie, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| I thought you said you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Is that it for public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| No, sir. I've got two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Barbara Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4833)|
| 1:20:47| Ms. Simpson, if you could give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Yes, Barbara Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I live at 1302 Luttrell Street, which is in 4th and Gill Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| First I want to say I don't think that the RFP process was flawed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| but I think all of you have a copy of the evaluation that was performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| There were five evaluators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| They were asked to rate it as to quality of rehab, intended use and experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| On every one of those, the project that you're asked to vote on today came in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| They were not rated number one on any three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| So basically they are the second rated project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| They're not the best that this community can do with that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| and for our neighborhood and Old North Knoxville and downtown, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| There were many public meetings held prior to coming up with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| by the steering committee that was directed by the community design center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| Overwhelmingly, in those public input sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| the one thing that came out was some do not allow suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| One of those do not allows was low income housing, and that's what this project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| It's low income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| And the community said do not allow low income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| The community design center steering committee specifically stated in their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| that senior housing, given the current development of Oakwood School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| and other existing nearby senior living options, the market may be saturated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| So not only is it a do not allow low income project, it's a senior housing that we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| There's an abundance of senior housing in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| What they did recommend, it says reuse of Knoxville High School should provide a population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| to support existing retail and entertainment nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| And they also recommended mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| We're talking about there not being any businesses or restaurants or anything in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| That's part of what we want to do is get some in that area and probably in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| We need some community economic development in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| We desperately need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| We have lost Broadway, but we can regain Fifth Avenue and Central if we put the right things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5006)|
| 1:23:34| Now, I, too, am a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I'm 30 days younger than Mr. Murrah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| And I probably also fall into the low income category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| But because this is low income senior housing, I doubt that those seniors, most of them anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| are going to have anywhere near $5,000 of disposable income, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5028)|
| 1:23:55| The rents are going to be very high, and I'm not sure, frankly, that I could afford to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| But that's a whole other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| I understand that you have a dilemma here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| You can either vote this up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| We can't make another choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I'm not asking you to go with Mr. Dewhurst's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| I'm not pushing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I am pushing mixed use development for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| It's a grand building, and it needs a grand project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| I would rather see nothing done now than settle for second best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| We're settling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| The only thing that put this recommended project on top was money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| And that is really, really sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| So for $500,000 we're going to get second best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| I would really like to see this shelved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| I would rather see nothing than settle for second best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Todd Reckenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5096)|
| 1:25:06| Your name and address in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| I'll make it short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| My name is Todd Reckenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| I live at 3220 Clearview Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Careful, he's an insurance agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| I appreciate the service and commitment you guys make to serve the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| I appreciate your support in what you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I want to just give my public support for a couple different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| This building happens to be pretty strategically located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| almost identically in between where my wife and I have raised our family in north Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and where I work on downtown Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| It's almost perfectly to draw a map between the two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| This is where this building happens to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| I want to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| I think we have a real opportunity to be able to serve the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| by providing the opportunity to let Southeastern Housing develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| I've seen the work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| I know the character of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| I think it's an opportunity to be able to transform one of our most strategically located buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| into something we can be proud of and to care for those people who really need a safe place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| that they can be proud of and feel good about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| Lastly, it seems like to me it's an easy decision in terms of having a positive economic impact for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| As you guys struggle to be able to make the budget come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| we have an organization where you can delegate this responsibility to take this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| and develop it into something we can all be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| That's basically all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| There's nobody else for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| The purpose of my motion was to engage public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| If it be agreeable with the second, I would withdraw my motion and defer to Commissioner Amy Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5202)|
| 1:26:50| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Yes, I'll move that we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Does the seconder agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| If he withdraws his motion, there is no motion, so we need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| You know, as I look at this resolution we're voting on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| and I listened to the folks talk about this, I come to the conclusion Mr. Mayer is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5240)|
| 1:27:31| The process was followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| But Ms. Simpson is right as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| And I think the evaluators would agree with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| No disrespect to family pride, but the best project for that area is, without a doubt, Mr. Dewhurst's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5260)|
| 1:27:49| that tight proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| And so, you know, we're left with a, you know, in a dilemma with the process being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| But in my opinion, I'm giving you my opinion, the best project didn't win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| And it didn't win because for whatever reason, for whatever, I say dumb reason at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| the second place project chose to put a big fat zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| I don't know whether it was profit center or whatever, but that made no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| They asked you a direct question, and you really didn't, in my opinion, you were nonresponsive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| So I'll say shame on you for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| But, you know, as I look at it, so with that said, okay, I hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| I hate that they chose to put that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I think they probably could have gotten, put in half that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| They put $250,000 in that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| It probably would have beat the current thing that we're going to vote on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| But one thing I look at, and it's going to drive my vote, is what's best for Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5327)|
| 1:28:57| What's best for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| As I look, listen to yesterday's channel, whatever's talk show, they talked about downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5340)|
| 1:29:09| I guess George Korda talked about when he came, someone asked for directions to Market Square from West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5349)|
| 1:29:17| I remember the dialogue about how asinine it was to develop an ugly Miller's building to put an electric company there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5357)|
| 1:29:26| I remember those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| Why are we spending this money downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| We need to bring a big, fat wrecking ball, Commissioner Shouse was heavily involved in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| and just tear up downtown and just start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| And look at what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| I remember when the now governor talked about building a movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| No one's going to come downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| They're too scared to come downtown on a Friday night to see a movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| I went to see The Best Man on Friday, and it was just jam-packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Not just that theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| It was jam-packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| No one's scared of downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| Businesses are thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| But when those two cornerstone projects came, they were forward thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| They said, okay, it's going to take more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| It's not today's audience that we're building this for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| We're building this for tomorrow's audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| And mixed use is tomorrow's audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| We're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| Ms. Simpson's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| We're going to lose that corridor if we don't do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| And I'm not saying this vote up or down is going to lose that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| but I do think a mixed use project would be a linchpin to propel that part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5435)|
| 1:30:43| into something that's extremely positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| You know, you talk about walking through the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| The seniors are walking, and I see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| They're not carrying bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| They're not shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| They're there for exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| They're picking up one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| But who's buying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| It's that mother with three kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| It's that, you know, recently graduated college student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| It's Ms. Williams who's living downtown, sounds like, from her address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| You know, that's who this thing could be for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| So I'm not going to vote for this project today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I'm sure I'll be in a minority on my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| But I did want to say it's no disrespect to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| The process was correct, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| It was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| I wish maybe different questions could have been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| but foremost I wish Mr. Dewhurst or his team would have answered the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| in a way that wanted to win the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| And when they put the zero down there, they probably doomed their particular fate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| So with that said, I don't think because of that mistake that we need to compound that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| This is a huge building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| It's a nice building from an architectural standpoint, from a historical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| So I just think we could do so much more than that with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| and I think mixed use would have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| So I'll step kindly off my soapbox at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| When this first came out, I actually had exactly the same opinion as Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| And I probably spent more time on this one issue in the past month or six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| than on anything in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| I have really dug into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| I've looked at every bit of information on it, the RFPs, the proposals, the design center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5559)|
| 1:32:49| presentation, the ageless downtown seminar that we just had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5569)|
| 1:33:00| And I gradually came around to the position that this actually is the best use for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5580)|
| 1:33:11| I think that mixed use is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| and I think there's a lot of buildings around there that should be mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| But this particular building, actually, the way it sits and it's actually being a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5598)|
| 1:33:28| I think it is more suited to this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| Most mixed uses I see are sitting right on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| They don't have quite as huge a setback as we have with this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| Schools are designed to be facing inward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| Mixed use buildings need to be facing more outward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| So that's one of the things that I've been educated on as I've worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| I also want to say that I'm also disappointed that no monetary offer was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5641)|
| 1:34:10| I know that there was an offer of discounted rent to teachers for some apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| and there was just no way for us to quantify that in any type of monetary value to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5657)|
| 1:34:26| And additionally, as I looked into that and spoke with the law department and finance and purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5666)|
| 1:34:35| what I realized is that although that was a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and I hope that someone will do something with that, it really needs to be a little more well thought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| because what that would require would be someone, a county employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| who would have to go out every month and verify who's living in those apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| Are they getting that discount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| I mean, it was a great concept, but it's just not well enough fleshed out to be able to do anything with it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| So I hope a developer will take that and do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5702)|
| 1:35:11| One of the problems that I think we've had, there's been a lot of misinformation, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| circulating through our community about this, about subsidized housing, low-income housing, seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5718)|
| 1:35:29| And I think a lot of it, unfortunately, stems from either people who have not had a lot of experience with seniors yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5729)|
| 1:35:40| and or really don't understand what independent senior living is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| It's not a nursing home and it's not assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| And fortunately for me, as you all know, the last five years I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| I've worked very hard on senior issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| This is something where I actually do feel like I have some expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I also have two grandmothers who went from living in the home that they lived in with their husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| into an apartment in a regular apartment complex and then into independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| And one of them is still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| And what people are expecting out of this is not what my experience with the independent living senior facilities have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5781)|
| 1:36:30| Both of my grandmothers, when they lived on their own in their apartments, they were fairly active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| They knew their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| But once they moved into an independent living facility where they had a peer group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| and, more importantly, where they were not dependent, they didn't have to get out and drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| A lot of our seniors, when they're living on their own, are not as active in the community as they could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| because they know they should not be out driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| And that's one of the great things about independent living is that all their transportation is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| So actually, for both of my grandmothers, their activity level actually probably tripled or quadrupled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| once they got into independent living because they didn't have to worry about themselves being out on the road in the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| and they didn't have to feel, you know, seniors don't like to feel like they are being a burden to their friends and family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| by asking for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And being in a facility like this where that's not a cause of concern for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| they actually tend to become more active in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| They are out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| The place where my grandmother in Nashville lived was close to a retail strip mall area and a regular mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5861)|
| 1:37:50| and a place like Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| And they did frequently walk from where they lived over to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| My 95-year-old grandmother, who lives in independent living in Chattanooga, Tennessee right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| is still a shopaholic and gets out and shops every chance she gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5886)|
| 1:38:14| So I think there's just been a lot of unfortunate misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| and just a lot of uncertainty or unknown about what this is and what it's going to bring to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5900)|
| 1:38:30| And I think it's been very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| And I think I want to point out that I think one of the reasons that this has happened is because it's absolutely true that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| North Knoxville for a long time has been the dumping ground of every subsidized, low-income, homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| shelter, halfway house, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| So when somebody here is low-income, oh, my God, what are they doing to us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| And it makes it very hard to dial it back and have a really productive discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| But I have to say that I am incredibly proud of the 4th and Gill neighborhood and especially their leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| This has been a very difficult, difficult time and situation for our community to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5948)|
| 1:39:19| Unfortunately, I think there's some reputation repair that needs to be done as far as the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5959)|
| 1:39:27| I've heard from a lot of seniors who are concerned about what they've heard, that they don't feel welcome in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| And I don't believe for a minute that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| But I think the neighborhood leadership has done an excellent job of kind of keeping a lid on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| and having a good process, a good discussion, and not letting it get out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| So I do support this 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| And I have to say I started where Sam was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| And the more time and effort and research I put into it, I've gradually come around to where I think this is truly the best use for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| I support it 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| And I look forward to continuing to work with the neighborhood on getting more correct information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6003)|
| 1:40:12| And I think this will be an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| So thank you for indulging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| I started in the beginning and still continue to believe along the same lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| as what Commissioner McKenzie proposed a few minutes ago in regards to being a mixed-use type neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| My concern about this process here is that even though we got started off on the wrong foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| and maybe everything was done yada, yada, yada down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| last fall the school board asked the design center to do a study on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6049)|
| 1:40:59| Their recommendations were supposed to be the basis for this RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6059)|
| 1:41:09| And one of them was that low-income or subsidized housing was not to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| But the winner of this RFP is using supposedly, according to this document, community investment tax credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6076)|
| 1:41:28| which requires to be eligible the followings that they have to be for low-income Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| and activities for low-income Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| What I've heard, we've all got tons of paperwork on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| This is going to be a glorified hotel for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| These 24-hour concierge, re-taxi service here and there, there's nothing in this life free anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6112)|
| 1:42:04| All these things that you provide for people have to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| So where are we benefiting them that much other than the fact of having a one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6129)|
| 1:42:19| where that so many can be under one roof and kind of be shepherded in a safe manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6139)|
| 1:42:29| I still don't think this is the best use for this property, and I will not be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| We have a motion and a second on the floor for approval of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| Brad, can I make one more comment about the RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Quickly, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| Not the proposal, but the report that the design center put out was intended as a guideline, and that's how it was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6174)|
| 1:43:04| In the actual RFP itself, it did not have those do not use uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| and that was not a recommendation by the design center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| Frankly, those were comments made by the public at public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| I also want to point out that as much as I admire Mr. Dewhurst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| I do want to point out that in terms of which proposal is most likely to be successful long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| he stated himself in his interview during the appraisal process that he was not certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| that he was going to be able to make a go of his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| He was not sure that he was going to be successful with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| So that is another thing that weighed quite heavily on me as I was considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| Do we need a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| Sounds like nine to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Two nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6247)|

| 1:45:04| consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 9, entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| Procurement Code, to provide for various changes to the procurement code of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6310)|

| 1:45:32| No motion, no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| We've come to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| I think all we have is discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| So take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| Take a ten-minute break and come back at 340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| Come back to your seats so we can have our discussion items, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6354)|
| 1:46:03| Out of respect for Dr. McIntyre's schedule with school board tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| we're going to do the joint education first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| and then we're going to do Commissioner Norman's discussion item second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| Go ahead, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| On page 15, discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| So the Joint Education Committee, Matt, when we meet the first Thursday in each month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6393)|
| 1:46:43| one of the big things, this past meeting came on the heels of the school board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| where the teachers came and voiced some concerns about the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| So we ended up with a question, I guess, to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| and I think the commissioners that were there feel it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| But would it be appropriate for us to have a special workshop on the performance evaluation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6427)|
| 1:47:17| where they present to us what it is, what it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| You know, we kind of hear sound bites here and there, and we get e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| But allow representatives from the school board to come and talk with us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6444)|
| 1:47:36| So I'm looking to gauge the interest of the commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| And if you all are interested in it, we can come up with a few dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| and ask probably Terry to put that together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| So is that something we're interested in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| Unless I hear a loud nose or boos, I'm going to say the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| Everyone has a poker face here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Well, I think Chairwoman Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| and myself have talked about having another retreat, another day and a half retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| So we may incorporate that maybe in the February time frame sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| unless you want to do something quicker than that at Chairman's lunch or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| But, you know, our thinking was the Chairman's lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| we normally have two or three things on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| and we'll get performance evaluation light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| And, you know, we don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| There's volumes of things that the superintendent could present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| But we don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| But we did want something more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| If you think the retreat is the time to go into it for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| what I'm saying is an hour or two, not just a 15-minute overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| but a little more in depth and allow that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| and have them give us a greater understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| So I will say that I think generally we're interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| so I'll leave it up to you and the Chair of the School Board to put it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| either separate workshop or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| The other things that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| School Board member Doug Harris has really dug into the drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| the things that drive costs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| the natural things in the educational process that drives the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| And one of the things he talks about, I mean, that he presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6569)|
| 1:49:36| and he's going to have more details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| but I think these are some interesting numbers that I wanted to write down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| for you all's consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| It's 80% of the dollars, and these are Doug Harris's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| Now, he's done a due diligence, but they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| I don't know if they've been vetted or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| but I did want to present them because they were already being presented publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Eighty percent of the dollars go for education, classroom education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| Eighty percent of the school's dollars goes into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| And since 2008, they're only looking at about a three or four increase in cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| from 2008 to today, which is, you know, a fairly small number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| And during that same time period, the administrative cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| the cost of the administrative aspect of Knox County Schools has actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| I didn't get a number, but that's something that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| So those are three kind of bullet points that, you know, go into conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| I think those are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| And he's going to have paper for us at our next workshop to back these numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6638)|
| 1:50:48| I would say a majority of our meeting was good conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| and it was one of those things where Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Brawls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| and I weren't really proponents of that, but we feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| and Commissioner Hammond was, he wanted to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| I think he was on the road on I-40 over on the plateau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| or somewhere coming back from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| We didn't necessarily, we weren't pushing, and just to tell you what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| this idea of surveys, teacher surveys, teacher satisfaction surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| But one of the things I try to do, and I think everyone tries to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| is to bring the commission's thoughts and ideas to that joint education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| not our personal views, but the commission's thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| So we kind of got engaged in a conversation about that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| And, you know, from the school board standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| really, teacher morale, teacher process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6709)|
| 1:51:59| the whole educational process is under their purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| I mean, you know, we are the funding agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| but in terms of whether we're doing good, bad, or indifferent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| that's what we've been elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| That's what we've engaged the superintendent to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| And we don't disagree with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| But I think the majority of our conversation came where we talked about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| I mean, you know, the point I made is a return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| If we're asked to give higher and higher dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| and if we're really going to be asked, like we were a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| to do something drastic to make a substantial increase in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6755)|
| 1:52:46| we need to understand the return on our investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| And this was one data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| So we engaged in a conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| I don't think everyone agreed with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| I don't think I agreed with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| And I think that's the general consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| But it was a good conversation about we use that topic of teacher evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| teacher satisfaction surveys to engage in a larger degree and a greater topic about where we stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6783)|
| 1:53:14| what our role is, because, you know, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| and I think school board member Harris agreed, if it's just write us a check and shut up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| that's not going to happen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| But at the same time, that's not the way that they necessarily should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| By that same token, us getting into their business is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| just as bad in terms of us trying to do their job of educating the kids and running the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6813)|
| 1:53:42| And then we ended with a conversation about, well, with that surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6822)|
| 1:53:50| they have a bunch of data out there, okay, in terms of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| It was called TEL surveys that talk about the work environment, job satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| There's local surveys, surveys about strategic compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| So they have surveyed their staff, the teachers, the educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| and they have that data available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| Again, how much do we really want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| I mean, how much, you know, that's kind of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| They're fine to present it to us, but do we really want a volume of data to go into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| So what we asked the superintendent to do was, again, to give us a, not just a five-minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6866)|
| 1:54:32| but a general thumbnail sketch of what questions were asked, what were the general findings of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| And they've agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| And, you know, that's when we spend time at the end to talk about testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6883)|
| 1:54:51| and cheating prevention and independent analysis and a large drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| That was a direct, I think, Amy had someone ask her a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| And I don't know what the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| but one answer that came out of the process was some people may think that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| if I'm evaluating teachers and the teachers are being evaluated on a test score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| are they going to somehow mix those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| And that's just, that's not doable, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| but there are a lot of measures in place to prevent that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| And if a teacher is not doing their job from August through TCAP date, it's going to show up on the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6926)|
| 1:55:34| So that's not a, you know, can I somehow usurp the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| So we talked a lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| There is a lot of things, preventive measures in place for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| But in terms of a teacher being able, I mean, giving, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| grades that may be a little higher for this student as opposed to that student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| that's something that, I don't know how we ended up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| I looked to Dave and Amy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| It was Amy's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| But that's a whole different level, and that's more building supervision and principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| But in terms of the ACTs, the TCAPs, there are a lot of independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6967)|
| 1:56:14| And there's additional things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| They're not even, like if you're a fourth-grade teacher, you can't even test another classroom's fourth-grade class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| You have to test third grade or fifth grade or kindergarten or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| So there's a lot of measures that they continually put in place to give us an assurance that the students are being tested appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6986)|
| 1:56:37| So those are some of the things that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| The one item we've had on our agenda we hadn't been able to talk about up to this point, but it's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| and that was real property, the property, you know, that whole piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| I won't go into any more detail because I'm sure that's going to be the one thing that we dig into at the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| So there are several lights on, but I'll look to the other committee members to give me any input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7018)|
| 1:57:10| Commissioner Briggs, you had your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| You know, I understand what you're saying with all of that is, you know, one of the concerns that I have, a couple of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| One, what's the role of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| What's the role of the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| But on this teacher evaluation, I thought that some of these teacher evaluations were dictated by the acceptance of the race to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| And this is coming out of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| So I'm not so sure what we can do about it, and much less the school board and some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| because this is not coming from this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| And, I mean, I think it's fine for us to hear how they evaluate teachers, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7062)|
| 1:57:49| are we getting into something that we just have no authority over at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| And I'm not talking about the conflicts that happened between the school board and the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| but this is something that was hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| I mean, this almost gets to be a federal issue because the feds gave us the money to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| and if there's something not good about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| then it needs to be between the state and the federal people who gave us the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| Oh, yes, yes, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| And the whole point of this was, again, like I said, it was on the heels of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| and it was just an opportunity for us to hear what's being done, not to have any comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| to say I don't like this question, I don't like this evaluation, or it shouldn't be done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| No, that's not it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| So you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| Yes, there are contracts in place, I'm sure, between Race to the Top folks and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| and the state and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| But, no, this is simply a reporting of what it is because there's probably some misinformation out there about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7120)|
| 1:58:48| you know, whether it's positive, negative, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| So it would just give us an opportunity to understand what the evaluation process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| hear it from the horse's mouth about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| so when we get questions and e-mails, we'll be in a better position to say, no, it's really this is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| and exactly what you're saying, that this isn't a Knox County issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| And, you know, the one thing that in the meetings that I've had with Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| and some of the school board people that I've wanted to see is where we do standardized testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| Now, some of that just came out, I think it was with this, I can't remember if it's the NEAD or the NAED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7160)|
| 1:59:26| but those tests that they do in the fourth and eighth grades that are national tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| that we can compare ourselves to other people that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| I think it was Tennessee, there were major editorials in the New York Times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post that spoke about Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| and we were the only state they talked about as basically we broke the records on the progress that we made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| And one of the conversations I had with Dr. McIntyre, you know, first of all, I congratulated him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| and we need to really congratulate the teachers and not Dr. McIntyre because it's the teachers, not to take anything away from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| but it's the teachers that did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| And the other point I tried to make, if there are things that are just extremely burdensome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| that's not getting the results in the classroom, could we take some of that off the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| And that's something that I hope that they would, you know, they would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| And I understand that next year, I'm interested in results, so the kids learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| And I believe that next year they're coming up with another national standard where they're testing the kids in different grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| And this is a national test so we can see how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| And it's not based on T-caps, which are just sort of what we say is good or not good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| but we're comparing ourselves to children all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| And that's what I'm really interested in are the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| Just very briefly, I had a conversation with Steve Smith, you know, who runs the South College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| and they test all of their kids who are enrolling in courses before they start because one of the metrics that they're being judged on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7253)|
| 2:01:01| and this may have a major impact on for-profit institutions like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| and it's a problem over at UT and any college, is that they're testing these kids and they're coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| they're not ready and not capable of even doing the work that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| And that's what we ought to reach as a goal because all of these kids are going to need additional skills to get ready for the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| But if they're finishing high school and they're going to South College or UT or Pellissippi State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7282)|
| 2:01:27| and they just can't read and do basic math enough to do the work, we're not serving them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7287)|
| 2:01:34| And that's what we need to do is to get all of these kids ready to go to the next stage of their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| The goal is not K through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| The goal is a K-through job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| I changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| I didn't know that's all we had to do is just wear him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| Medication is wearing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| I think there are two discussion items before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| Let's stick with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| My comments are to the small joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| I believe the question was, what was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| Do you want a performance evaluation special workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| So let me really back up to what I think I've said in the past and I want to say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7345)|
| 2:02:34| If we have a long continuum from the end that I've always been on, which is bricks and mortar, going the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7354)|
| 2:02:45| maybe I'll say the other end of that continuum is, and I believe this to be true, the appointment of principals for local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7365)|
| 2:02:58| I believe that to be the most important job that resides with the superintendent of schools in Knox County School District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7378)|
| 2:03:07| And he's heard me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| So if you move from what I believe, it's not necessarily a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| but from what I believe about principals at one end or the capital expenses, bricks and mortar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| as I said a moment ago, at the other end, then we have all those points along the way in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7402)|
| 2:03:30| I guess if I come off the bricks and mortar end, the next thing that I would see as being the big point would be total dollars spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7410)|
| 2:03:40| because we have been given that title here lately as the funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| So I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| As we move further toward the other end, I believe the superintendent and I have had discussions about books that are used in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7428)|
| 2:04:01| and I say people may complain to me and I may direct them toward my member of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7441)|
| 2:04:11| As a member of this body, I don't know that I can have an opinion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| And as we continue to move on down that line, I listen to and I sympathize with, and I will do what I can as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7456)|
| 2:04:30| but as we move toward what does the Board of Education do, as we move toward making principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7470)|
| 2:04:40| I view more and more of that to be in the hands of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| So now, speaking of the small joint committee, we talked of teacher surveys, we talked of teacher evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7485)|
| 2:04:55| and we talked something about ethics and how do grades get assigned and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7495)|
| 2:05:05| And my wife and my staff asked me why I didn't speak much, and I thought, well, to myself, it's sort of beyond the realm of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7505)|
| 2:05:21| other than giving opinion, I don't know if I can add to the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7521)|
| 2:05:30| Now, that does change when we hit the next two items that were on that agenda for that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| and we did not get a chance to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| That was, believe it or not, the old Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| We didn't talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| And rural high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| We didn't speak to rural high school either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| I guess those will be on the agenda for the next meeting of the small joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7549)|
| 2:05:57| And I would like to enter in those conversations, but I'll not be in town that particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7557)|
| 2:06:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| I'm sorry, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| First, thanks for the committee's meeting and discussing these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| I think it's significant that that meeting did occur before this school board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| where the basic demonstration of teachers' feelings about evaluation, among other things, happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7589)|
| 2:06:40| And just by the way, I mean, I've been a teacher and been here for my whole professional career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| and I don't think there's ever been anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| I don't think there's ever been teachers show up in mass like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| There's some serious, serious issues for those teachers to show like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7615)|
| 2:07:03| I appreciate Sam and the things that he had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7623)|
| 2:07:12| When somebody says misinformation, though, I do think frequently about the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7632)|
| 2:07:21| and I don't want to say they put out misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| but I do tend to have my doubts about the way some of the information is portrayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7647)|
| 2:07:36| to possibly be in more of a favorable light than it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| And so I would question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| I have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| If somebody says something like 80% of that funding goes to the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| I've got big questions about how you come to that 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| And administrative costs are actually going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| I've heard that some of this strategic planning is actually going to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| significant increases in administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| And so those kinds of things really concern me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| and, of course, I'd welcome the chance to dig down into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7691)|
| 2:08:18| I'm glad that the teacher satisfaction survey was brought up by this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| and I hope that it would be considered further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| especially in terms of third-party issues, third-party conducting it and comprising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7708)|
| 2:08:41| I'm reading my notes here on Sam, so hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| Oh, to that survey, and I know that I did, I have read some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| it was a 2011 survey, and I did have access to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| and I read some of the questions, and I thought, especially on some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| the construction of those questions were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| they were such that it really didn't get to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| So I had questions about the question, questions about the semantics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| or how that question was actually constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| So I would think that a third party would be really good at getting to what teachers want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7763)|
| 2:09:32| And that's also a consideration if we have some kind of workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| and we want to evaluate the evaluation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| I certainly would like to have not only the perspective of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| but a perspective of who's being evaluated and some of those folks would be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7785)|
| 2:09:55| I guess that's, you know, I appreciate the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| and I appreciate the work of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| and I think they are serving a good function for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| But I would like to remind the body that that was a historic moment there, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| for that school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| And I'll have some questions, further questions for Dr. McIntyre, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7813)|
| 2:10:19| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| One of the things about the education committee that I like is the fact that we are becoming educated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7821)|
| 2:10:27| and that's part of the process is we are becoming educated as the commissioners on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| about issues before the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| And I think that the school board members who are on that committee are also becoming educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| about everything that we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| And I think they fully realize that education, while it is the most, the biggest part of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| it's not the only thing that we talk about when we have these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| I mean, we've talked about Knoxville High School today and development and a whole range of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| and I think they understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| It was interesting to me that Mr. Harris at one of the meetings pointed out the fact that when it comes to food service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7856)|
| 2:11:03| the Knox County Schools is the largest food service provider in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7863)|
| 2:11:09| separate from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| So when you think about serving food to 50-some thousand students and teachers on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7871)|
| 2:11:18| and you're talking about transportation and you're talking about all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| that was just something that I hadn't really ever thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| yet it's something that the school people deal with every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| I want to echo what Commissioner Norman said about the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| The last time I saw a group of teachers come before a body was a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| when Leo Cooper was chairman of this body and Howard Pinkston was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| And I remember the front page of the newspaper after the budget vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| and there was a principal wagging his finger in front of Howard Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| about the fact that the commission did not vote the way that they wanted them to vote on the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| And this place was packed that day, as I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| I was a reporter covering that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| Since that time, but that wasn't before the school board, that was before commission on a budget vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| And so I think that it would be helpful for us to not dictate to them how they're doing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7920)|
| 2:12:07| but to understand what is going on and how we can assist in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| And I think that anything that we can do to be of assistance to that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| What we know a lot about is what we hear in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| And I was at the Lady Vol game last night and was sitting with a group of teachers from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| And they were talking about the YouTube video that's gone viral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| and seen by about 100,000 people of the teacher who's coming in saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| I'm probably going to get fired for saying this, but I have to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| And, you know, there was a group of teachers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| And then there was a Farragut High School student who came in and challenged Common Core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| I mean, these things are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| And these things are what people are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| And I think that we need to become educated from our, again, as part of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| is let's educate ourselves on exactly what these issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| and exactly how it impacts Knox County because that's what we're here for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| is we're not here to vote on school issues and to meddle in business, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| But I think we are here to better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| and to know what those issues are and see how we might be able to assist in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Commissioner McKenzie, do you want to finish up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| or do you want to go last or does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| I don't mind to go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| I just want to ñ it may be better for me to finish up because I wanted to ñ yeah, I'll finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| And I don't know if Dr. McIntyre would have to answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| but, you know, we've talked about the Common Core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| We've talked about the teacher evaluations that they're very unhappy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| And I can understand, you know, maybe why they're unhappy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| You know, I've read in the paper about the amount of time that they spend testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| rather than instructing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| And what my real question is, and I'm asking this because I don't know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| how much autonomy does the local school board have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| and does the superintendent have on how the teachers are tested dealing with Common Core?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| My understanding was that was something that's accepted at a state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| and that's not decided by the local school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| whether they're going to follow the Common Core curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| And the teacher evaluations, is that decided locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| or is that dictated by the state by accepting the race to the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| I mean, I just have ñ I don't know how much of that is a local issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| and how much of that is a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| And maybe somebody could answer, if somebody knows the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| Well, you know, and that's kind of why I wanted them to come and talk with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| I mean, there's ñ and you can pull that string and ask a bunch of different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| We're not getting into their charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| but those are great questions that I think a workshop would benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| I mean, I can go and complain about HIPAA to my hospital administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| but this was passed by the Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| I mean, you know, there's a lot of things we don't like about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| and you can complain to the local people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| but they don't have any authority to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| And that's what I didn't know is how much is local policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| how much is dictated by the state, and how much is dictated by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| And, you know, and again, so ñ and I'll turn to the chair at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| I'm sure the superintendent's like, I don't want to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| That's not my point and purpose here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| but there's questions going out there that I'm sure he's, you know, wanting to give answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| So that's ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| Here's what my thought is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| The things that we've talked about today, evaluations, teacher morale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| what's mandated by what law and authority, and then Common Core, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| Those are things that we probably need to have a long discussion about and just ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| I don't know that we're going to gain anything by bringing him up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| But the only reason I say that is that I don't ñ I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| I personally don't think it's worthwhile for us to have all these special meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| do all these things for us to be voting on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| It's like we've done, I think, personally, too many times on things that has ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| that we just don't have any control over, we don't have any influence over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| I mean, we can give a sympathetic ñ you know, some things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| My point here is none of us up here as a collective body know all of the things that go into all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| And so to answer constituent questions, you can't do that in a 15, 20-minute session with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8176)|
| 2:16:22| I think that's going to have to be something that's drawn out deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| and us say these are the things that the commission would like to learn about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| and also have some things that the commission would like to convey to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| at a long meeting with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| But, I mean, but, you know, just to get back to what Sam initially proposed is that we're deciding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| are we going to have a special retreat, are we going to have special meetings and do all of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| And my question is, do we even need to have those meetings if it's something that we can't do anything about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8207)|
| 2:16:53| Well, you need to know what you can do something about and what you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| I mean, do you know what we have control over now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| And the answer is no, we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| And so I think it's important that we have the meetings to know, to be educated as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| to know what mandates what and what is the truth of the matter, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8227)|
| 2:17:17| I mean, there's propaganda going on all over on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| And so the commission needs to be educated on what's mandated by Race to the Top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| what's mandated by the State Board of Education, what's coming from the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| I mean, we need to know that so we can answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| Are you done, Doc, or are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| Amy, there are commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| It's okay, you can call me Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| I just agree, Brad, completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| I don't need to vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| It doesn't matter to me if this is something that we control locally or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| I need to have a meeting like this with the school board so that I can be educated well enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| to answer the questions that my constituents have when they come to me so that I don't just have to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| Of course, I will say, you know, please also contact your school board member and discuss it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| But it's nice for me to have the correct answers to give as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| So I'm not looking for something to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| and it doesn't matter to me if it's something that is controlled at the federal level or the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8298)|
| 2:18:23| or the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| I just want to learn about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| So I'm all in favor of us getting together with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| Commissioner McKenzie, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Yeah, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| The only comment I wanted to add, well, I wanted to respond to was really two, and maybe I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8314)|
| 2:18:43| One, our meeting was actually the day after the school board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| so it was definitely fresh on the agenda for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| which is why this process came about us talking about a special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| And then the second thing, just to be clear, those numbers that I presented were not Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8337)|
| 2:19:05| They were Doug, a school board member, Harris' digging into the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| Those were his numbers, and they're going to be vetted through the superintendent at some point prior to next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8351)|
| 2:19:20| I'm sure they're pretty accurate in terms of how he vetted the numbers, but I agree with you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| It would be good to understand how they got the equations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| That's always a good thing, and just not blindly believe in the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| So I just wanted to make sure that folks understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| But, you know, I think Commissioner Hammond said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| It's not, in my opinion, it's not just bricks and mortar that we can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| We can talk about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| We're not going to vote on anything dealing with school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| We're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| I don't think anyone on this body wants to do that, but I do think knowledge is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| And this joint education committee, in my opinion, and I think it's shared, there's some uncomfortable moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| I mean, you know, we're not just saying it's not a pat on your back session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| We're pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| They're pushing back in terms of those gray areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| It's a good dialogue, I think, and I think this greater body is being well served by having this joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8416)|
| 2:20:25| I think the days are being numbered in terms of how long I think it was commissioned for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| and we'll have that conversation sometime around that January, February time frame, to my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| So this may or may not go on, but I think this is a good process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| and some good things are starting to come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Let's go to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| On page 16, discussion regarding the November 6, 2013 school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| And I'd just like to say a few things about that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| and then, of course, invite Dr. McIntyre to respond if he wishes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| He doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| For those of us that were there, and I think the only commissioners there was Dave Wright and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| and so what I experienced, what I witnessed was about two and a half hours of teachers individually approaching the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8478)|
| 2:21:32| and voicing their concerns about schools in various ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| Most of them had to do with evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| But just, you know, just a whole lot of frustration, angst, stress, tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8502)|
| 2:21:51| I mean, it was a session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| It was, for the people that were there, I mean, it was moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| And the testimonies that were given by these teachers and what they're going through, these were moving things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8519)|
| 2:22:10| So one of the things that I want to know is certainly from the board and from the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8530)|
| 2:22:21| were you moved by those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| Were you moved by these sentiments that were so heartfelt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| And so teacher morale is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| I mean, if we're wanting results and we're wanting performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| imagine how well a person of low morale performs compared to someone who is very satisfied with their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8557)|
| 2:22:48| Now, another question would be, with that meeting, there's 300-plus teachers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| Are these the 300-plus disgruntled teachers in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| And everybody else, 5,200 of them, are really pretty happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| I don't think so because I knew a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| I knew several of them that there were some of the finest educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| and decorated, awarded educators in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| They were here wearing red, and they weren't doing that unless they were very sincere about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8602)|
| 2:23:32| So I'm interested in teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| I think we all should be interested in teacher morale in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| And I hope that the committee pursues that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8618)|
| 2:23:45| And probably, I don't see how you can get to it without some kind of satisfaction survey with a third party, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8625)|
| 2:23:55| There's a number of things that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| I mean, I knew that right after that meeting, I felt like the PR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8638)|
| 2:24:07| and the school system would go to work really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| They did, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| There's been nothing in the paper but very, very positive stuff in the new Sentinel about performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8652)|
| 2:24:22| And I really do applaud performance and increases and scores and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8662)|
| 2:24:34| I do wonder, though, about how we relate some of these things to this variety of stuff that teachers are confronted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8674)|
| 2:24:46| Okay, so how does this ‑‑ what does this have to do necessarily with the evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8686)|
| 2:24:53| with TVAS, with Excel, with TEAM, with incentive pay, all these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| I'm really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| When you say evaluation, I also want to know how that central administration is evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| If you're going to put an evaluation on the teachers, how fair is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8710)|
| 2:25:18| If you don't evaluate your top management and at least give them the same kind of scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| and subject them to the same things that you're subjecting your teachers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| There's a number of inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| We had a decline in the ACT this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| How is that consistent with these other scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| And we know TCAP doesn't measure at a national standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| So we've got to be careful about those kinds of publishings, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8751)|
| 2:26:00| There is a lot of questions, questions about strategy, questions about coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| questions about letters of concern, all these things that evoke such emotion in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8766)|
| 2:26:17| So those are all things that I wanted to bring to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| I wanted to give you the chance to discuss them or anybody here to make a comment about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8780)|
| 2:26:27| and certainly give Dr. McIntyre a chance to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| Any other discussion about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| I think we covered most of that in the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| All right, let's move on to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Discussion regarding transparency of commission travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| I'm sorry, I was waiting on you to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| Go ahead, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| I've got a school board meeting here in just a minute, so I will have to be relatively brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| But, you know, I want to thank Commissioner Norman for bringing the discussion item forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| I think actually a good chunk of the agenda this evening for the school board's meeting is to really talk about the feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8821)|
| 2:27:09| that we received from teachers and to talk about, you know, where we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| You know, I think absolutely we have seen some good news in terms of outcomes for our students in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8835)|
| 2:27:24| and the Knox County schools the last week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| We saw, as Dr. Briggs mentioned, Tennessee was the fastest improving state in the nation on NAPE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8847)|
| 2:27:34| National Assessment of Educational Progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| In fact, Tennessee made the largest gains in the history of NAPE when all 50 states were participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| And that is really the one sort of national assessment that's an apples-to-apples comparison across states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| And so Tennessee made extraordinary gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| Last week, the state of Tennessee released its state report cards for schools and for districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| And for the first time ever, the Knox County schools achieved straight A's in academic achievement on the state report card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8878)|
| 2:28:06| and also achieved Level 5 TVAS scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8886)|
| 2:28:13| So the composite TVAS scores for the district are now aggregated into an overall score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8893)|
| 2:28:21| And Knox County schools was Level 5 in terms of literacy, Level 5 in terms of numeracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| Level 5 in terms of combined literacy and numeracy, and Level 5 in terms of overall composite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| So, yeah, there are some great outcomes there for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| I guess where I am, and I think as someone mentioned, we need to say thank you to our teachers for their incredible work to make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8916)|
| 2:28:46| and their focus on student learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| We are fortunate to have extraordinary educators in the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| and there's been a lot of change in public education the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| There has been a lot of change in Knox County schools in the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| And, you know, I think what we need to do is to make sure that our teachers are supported in the great work that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| so that they can continue to keep their focus on student learning and student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| and continue to have the tools and the resources and the support and the professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| that they need to meet the really high expectations that our community has, that our state has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| and that we have in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| And ultimately, this is about making sure that we do support our teachers so that they can provide a great education to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8968)|
| 2:29:35| So, yes, I think it was an important conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| I think it's an important ongoing dialogue, and we've been trying to provide opportunities for our teachers to provide input, provide feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8977)|
| 2:29:48| We're in the strategic planning process for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| We're trying to have lots of small group meetings with teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| and other ways of hearing from our teachers about how we can support the work that they're doing in our classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=8995)|
| 2:30:01| And I'll just say this, and Commissioner Norman knows this very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| the job of effectively educating children is really nuanced, complicated, hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9005)|
| 2:30:12| and we need to make sure that our teachers have the support they need to do it effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| and we'll continue the conversation, and the school board will have some conversation about that specifically this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9017)|
| 2:30:24| I welcome you all to join us for that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Just real quick, you know, change is always difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| Is this something that is unique to Knox County, or is this a national problem too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| Because I know at the whole level, if you read the national and even the international magazines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9039)|
| 2:30:46| there's really a revolution where finally the United States is waking up, that we're not keeping up with the rest of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9046)|
| 2:30:53| And, you know, we saw the Ray, I think was her name, she goes to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9053)|
| 2:31:00| She sort of shook up the system, ends up getting fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| She's back in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9066)|
| 2:31:07| But, I mean, is this a problem that we're really seeing all over the country or even in the state with all the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| And I know teachers are under a tremendous amount of pressure right now to get results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9073)|
| 2:31:19| Or is this just a unique Knox County issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| I think it's a challenge across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| I think Tennessee is one of the places where you've seen the most change in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| I think there have been a lot of changes to policy, education policy over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| in an effort to no longer be 48th or 47th in the country in outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| And, by the way, on the NAEP assessment in the two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| we generally moved from about 47th or 48th in the country to now 38th, 39th in the country on those particular assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| That's considerable progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| But there's been a lot of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| And there's been, I think our teachers have done a great job through that change of keeping their focus on our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| But I think that it is a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| and it's something that we need to continue to make sure we support our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| and make sure that we show our appreciation to our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| and make sure that they have the tools and resources they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| I think where we are in the conversation right now is trying to find the right balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| I mean, clearly our community, our parents, expect, have high expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9142)|
| 2:32:29| and high standards for the work that happens in our classrooms and, ultimately, to make sure our kids are prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9149)|
| 2:32:35| But I also think we need to make sure that our teachers are supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| and feel supported in the very hard work that they do and that our community appreciates so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| So trying to find that right balance and strike that right balance, I think, is where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| and where the school board is at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| And that's part of the conversation we're going to have in about a half hour here at the school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9169)|
| 2:32:55| All that and no mention of a rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| It's a numeracy, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| All my words were monosyllabic until that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9186)|
| 2:33:07| Next thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| I do have one last question for Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| Have you found the Civil War maps yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| I'll have some conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| We know where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| We know where they are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| Hey, if I may, Mr. Chairman, real quick, a couple of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| So, yes, Common Core State Standards are a requirement of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| Park assessments are a requirement of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| Evaluating every teacher every year and at least 50% of that evaluation being based on student outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| is actually state statute in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| So part of what I hope to do tonight also at the school board meeting is also just help make sure we clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| what are state mandates and requirements versus what are local choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| And so those are just quickly a couple of responses to Dr. Briggs' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| A question regarding transparency of commission travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9237)|
| 2:34:04| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| Commissioners, there's three of us that have lived through Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| And we know what transparency is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| And that's why I brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| And I think everybody on this board knows that's why I brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| and this reason only why we brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| Just making it easier for the public to know who's going where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| I don't care who goes where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| Just we need to make it so the public can know who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| Before any of us got on commission, several commissioners were going all over the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| and Hawaii and all different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| And there was a lot of stink and things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| I just wanted to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| And I brought this as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| I could have just come with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| but I brought it before you for this body here just because I want your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| I want to know what you're thinking or sort of guide me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| Like I say, I could have just come up with a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| and that's what I'm going to do next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| I will have a resolution next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| But I wanted to hear from some of you, Mr. Chairman, and hear what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| I was waiting to see Chris Caldwell, but I think he's already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| You know, there's some things we just don't know what the budget of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9319)|
| 2:35:25| I don't care who spends what amount of money, but we need to know, you know, how much do we have total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| I mean, that's a lot of questions that I've been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| I actually have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| I was directing that to the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| So, Brad, you know, I've asked you to look, but if Brad doesn't have it, Amy, you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9335)|
| 2:35:44| I don't have the current budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| I know that I don't have the current budget year we're working in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| the approved budget line item for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| I think it's $20,000 for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| Actually, for 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9364)|
| 2:36:05| $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9365)|
| 2:36:06| Then my question, you know, who makes that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Is that the Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Joe Lee, does the Chairman make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| I'll answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| The budget is proposed by the Chairman to the Mayor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9375)|
| 2:36:21| and discussions are had with the Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9381)|
| 2:36:25| The practice of previous Chair tenures has been that the Chair always approve the travel once it's been requested, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9385)|
| 2:36:38| That is not a rule, and so I think that that should be placed under consideration for the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9398)|
| 2:36:48| to be added into the commission rules that the Chairman approve all of the travel by the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9408)|
| 2:36:57| where money is expensed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| I think that's been a practice but not a rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| and I think that should be a consideration of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| I can't tell you to approve it or not, but I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| Mike, that's your committee, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| Yeah, well, let's just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| Let's just send it to the Rules Committee and let the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| That sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| I don't know, there may be some others that want to speak on this subject here tonight, too, but we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Hey, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| You know, I'm simply speaking on the merits of this discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| And this has been a theme that I've been dealing with in terms of whether commissioners should go to meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9451)|
| 2:37:45| outside of Knox County or travels involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| We should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| We cannot learn here in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| I'm looking at my travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| Commissioner Burroughs, she has to travel, I guess, probably since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| Since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| Since 2006, everyone sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| You know, I've not been on travel since I went to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| I think me and Commissioner Ormby and Commissioner Anders were two or three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9492)|
| 2:38:16| That's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9496)|
| 2:38:17| We need to travel more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| We need to travel to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| One dinner is not enough to the body that every month we're getting money from, passing money on to our constituents in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9501)|
| 2:38:32| We can learn from our national bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| So I think $9,000 is atrocious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| For 11 members, $9,000 for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| That's not enough if we're doing our job effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| And I canceled a trip last year because my father became ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9527)|
| 2:38:52| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| I plan on going to the next NACO in Washington, D.C., until you all zero those dollars out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| because we can learn from folks in Macon, Georgia, or Denver, Colorado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9538)|
| 2:39:04| We can learn from folks that are actively involved with what it takes to do legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9544)|
| 2:39:13| It's not a boondoggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| Either we're going to drive or we're going to take a commercial flight and sit in a seat that hits me about an inch or two shorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9557)|
| 2:39:24| than I need it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| So this isn't, I want to take vacation from work to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| So if it's a dollars issue, I just did a last minute, Jolie had to jump on me for not turning in my benefits package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9570)|
| 2:39:40| Because, to be honest, if we want to talk about money, I choose not to use the health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| That's real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| So I'll bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| All the commissioners should not use health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| So if this is a money thing, $9,000 or $20,000, that's real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9592)|
| 2:39:59| I don't think we should do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| So it's like if it's a pet peeve here or there, we want to jump on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| If it's something that's not, the Pension Committee, they go out to California for a conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9606)|
| 2:40:14| but they need to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9614)|
| 2:40:15| They're dealing with millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| They can learn from the people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| So, you know, we're getting hung up on something, and we want to go back to that faithful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9619)|
| 2:40:25| I'm not going to spend the last three years or the next three years or whatever on this body going back to that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9625)|
| 2:40:34| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| We've come a long way away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| Every conclusion we want back to that date, that infamous date, Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9638)|
| 2:40:44| So this really bothers me that we're even having a conversation about someone going on travel twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9644)|
| 2:40:53| We're talking about $9,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| I say shame on the rest of us for not going out there and see what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| Go and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| If you don't like it, don't go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| But it's really work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| Now, you can go there and not go to the meetings, but that's not what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| So, you know, it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| I encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9672)|
| 2:41:13| I'm going to, you know, Rules Committee and Chairman allowing, I'm going to go to at least one meeting a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| because it's part of what I think I was elected to do, to get better in my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| In all of our jobs, we try to get better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| We don't walk in, we're not elected, you know, on one day and become experts the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| We try to learn and get better, and that's what this type of travel does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| And sometimes it may be geared toward a minority or a woman, but it's getting better within the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| It's growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| This was an economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| Yeah, it was geared one way or another, geared for rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| They have economic development for rural counties or for urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| That's targeted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| So, you know, let's not get hung up on what it is, but say, does this travel benefit, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9720)|
| 2:42:07| Commissioner Breaux and her district, Knox County, and our constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| And I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| So, you know, I hate to go on about this one, but it's very disheartening to me when we're saying travel to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9734)|
| 2:42:25| about the legislative process and we are legislators is a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| I just don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| So thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| This is always a difficult thing to talk about because I think there are two schools of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| One school of thought is that we shouldn't travel and that we shouldn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| The other is, no, you need to travel so that you can learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| I fall on the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| For example, on the pension board, when we took we have to take a separate oath of office on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| and that separate oath of office says that you are required to gain knowledge during the course of your tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9778)|
| 2:43:07| so that you can vote and do the things necessary to make sure that you're doing your fiduciary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| And I double-checked that this morning with our legal counsel, and that is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| We are responsible for overseeing the pension board, is responsible for overseeing a half a billion dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9798)|
| 2:43:24| with a B of benefits and monies for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9804)|
| 2:43:30| Now, the laws change constantly, and we are asked and encouraged to go to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9810)|
| 2:43:37| Yes, some of them are in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| Some are in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| That's just where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| There are very few in Wartburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| And so you have to go to where the meetings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| And so that's why I think it's important that we go, is we have a responsibility as pension board members to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9826)|
| 2:43:53| And so I don't begrudge anybody for going to those because they learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| and they are better able to report back to us things that they have learned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| and it helps us with our votes because we take some very important votes on the course of a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9840)|
| 2:44:06| with regards to the pension benefits for the citizens and for the employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| The other thing is, as a commissioner, the laws change constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| You go to Nashville on any given legislative session, look at how many bills are there that affect Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| Well, we can't know the impact of those bills sitting in this building all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9862)|
| 2:44:28| You know, a wise man told me once there are a lot of smart people in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9868)|
| 2:44:32| but not every, you know, there are smart people outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| So let's find out who those people are, and let's find out what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| and let's see what we can do to bring it back here to make our county even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| So you look at the legislative process in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| I agree. I think we need to be spending more time in Nashville, not less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| because there are things that are passed in Nashville we have no idea what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9890)|
| 2:44:54| and then all of a sudden our law director says, oh, by the way, the legislature just passed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| We didn't have any input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| They don't know the impact it has on us, and I'm not saying we need to be there every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| but I think that we owe it to our citizens to know what's going on with our legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9904)|
| 2:45:09| You go to Washington, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| I mean, look at everything that changes in Washington every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| I think NACO is one of the most valuable trips we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| I would have gone last year if I hadn't gotten sick at the last minute and had to cancel my trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| But I learn a tremendous amount in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| When you have an opportunity to talk to members of the White House staff, the congressional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| and plus just the other people all across the United States that you can sit down and talk with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9929)|
| 2:45:35| and learn what they're doing and opportunities that you have to learn from these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| if you can pick up one idea that can save us money or help us be a better county, then it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| And so I have no problem with the transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| I mean, if we need to put it on our website, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| But in terms of should we do this, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| I think that we need to continue learning, inform ourselves about changes in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9956)|
| 2:46:01| and do everything that we can to help make our county better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| And I think that this is one of the things that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9969)|
| 2:46:12| I'm going to say something, but I'll wait until the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| Well, I, unfortunately, since I had to spend so much time on Knoxville High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| I didn't have as much time to prepare all of this as I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| But I did pull all of the commission travel records from 2006 for all sitting commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9984)|
| 2:46:33| And I put together a list for everyone of their travel, where they went, how much it cost, what they were there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=9993)|
| 2:46:44| I'm going to have Jolie scan these in and e-mail everybody their individual one before I turn them over to the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10004)|
| 2:46:53| I think it's important that we do know where we're going and what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| I think it's important for the public to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| However, what we do is a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| This is available for anyone to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| I will say that I don't have going back as far as 2006 on some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10028)|
| 2:47:14| We've had to request records out of archives, so I don't have a complete record on, for example, Commissioner Hammond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10034)|
| 2:47:21| There are some things that are missing out of yours because they've been archived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| but it's not a big deal when I look at what you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| It is no surprise to me why I've always considered you one of the most educated commissioners that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10049)|
| 2:47:34| and why I've always considered you to be one of our strongest leaders on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10054)|
| 2:47:38| because you take the time to get yourself educated both in Nashville and in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| about what's going on and bring it back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10064)|
| 2:47:50| I think it's also important to point out that our rules, commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| state that two commissioners are required to attend the NACO conferences every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10076)|
| 2:48:03| Not they should, not they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| Two shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| And so far, Mike Hammond and Sam and I are the only ones who have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10089)|
| 2:48:17| Mike and Sam were both supposed to go last year and had problems and weren't able to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| I was able to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| I also want to point out that every bit of travel I've ever done for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10104)|
| 2:48:30| has been approved ahead of time by whoever the commission chair was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10110)|
| 2:48:34| because that was my understanding that that was how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| That's never been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| I've pulled our budget for every year from 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| We have underspent on our budget every year except for 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10123)|
| 2:48:50| As far as this being just an issue of transparency, I do take exception to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10130)|
| 2:48:57| based on comments made in the media and on the news story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| The only year that was given out was FY2013, which was incredibly misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10141)|
| 2:49:09| When you look at the entire scope of all of us and the travel that we have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| I don't have the highest travel expenditures on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| This was also coupled with my attendance record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10160)|
| 2:49:27| There was an attempt to make an issue of those two things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| I think that we do need to take a look at our budget, travel budget, moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10171)|
| 2:49:38| I added up and did some math real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| and an average trip to a NACO conference for an individual costs about $1,900,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| and we're required to send at least two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| There's two NACO conferences per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| There's one in March that's legislative in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10194)|
| 2:49:58| There's another one in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| Somewhere around the country, the first year I went, it was actually in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| So those are four $1,900 trips right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10204)|
| 2:50:10| Going to the TCSA COAT conferences in Nashville, that's an average of $440 a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10210)|
| 2:50:17| So it's not quite as expensive, but we're driving instead of flying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| It's usually one night instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| That's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| I'd also like to point out that of all six of the conferences that I've been to on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| that dealt pretty much exclusively with women's issues, they've averaged about $300 a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10231)|
| 2:50:38| Going back to where I think some of this has come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10238)|
| 2:50:46| I am tremendously disappointed, Commissioner Smith, in how this has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10246)|
| 2:50:54| This was not simply about transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| You did single out one commissioner, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10257)|
| 2:51:01| And I was not the one with the highest travel budget either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| So I think that's very disingenuous of you to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10265)|
| 2:51:12| And also trying to couple it with my attendance record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10272)|
| 2:51:18| And I want you to understand that since being elected to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| a shooting, two brain surgeries, a concussion, five cerebrospinal fluid leaks, viral meningitis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| eight kidney stones, a tumor removed from my upper chest, a uterine hemorrhage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10289)|
| 2:51:34| and the beginnings of menopause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| Now, the feedback I get from my constituents is that I work hard and I do a good job for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10297)|
| 2:51:46| They are the ones that I answer to, not to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10306)|
| 2:51:52| Now, having said that, I appreciate what Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| and Commissioner McKenzie have said about travel and its importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| Every one of us up here has travel expenses through the commission and through the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10320)|
| 2:52:07| I have not seen a single thing in here that looks inappropriate and toward unethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10327)|
| 2:52:14| The only one that there's not an expense for is Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| He's not traveled yet, but I hope that he will, especially now that he's got a new hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| Dave Wright has not traveled, but I want to point out that we have paid for Dave to do CTAS training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10344)|
| 2:52:32| I travel under the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| So Dave definitely does his continuing education through CTAS, which I am very much appreciative of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10356)|
| 2:52:45| But everybody else up here has traveled on behalf of the commission and on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| and not a single bit of it, from what I can tell, has been misspent, unethical, or inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10370)|
| 2:52:58| So, you know, if we want to have a resolution next week saying that this goes front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| and center on the website, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10382)|
| 2:53:06| I'm absolutely fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| But it's time to be a little more professional, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10388)|
| 2:53:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| Going back to your records in 2006, you'll find that I did attend the NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10401)|
| 2:53:27| Again, it's not on there, but I did attend the NACO, and I turned in only half my expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| I want to reemphasize again, I am not against people going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| Don't mind that a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| I'm pretty busy is what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| I can't go to a lot, but those of you that go, Mike, you do a great job and don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10421)|
| 2:53:47| What I do have heartburn is you wanted to be a commissioner, you were elected to be a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10427)|
| 2:53:54| you were paid to be in your seat, but you chose to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| You wouldn't be able to go somewhere else unless you were a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10438)|
| 2:54:02| That was my issue with it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| And that's what I'm here in the community is your first responsibility is being in your seat as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10444)|
| 2:54:10| And whatever conference you go to, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| I'm not going to get into this fight, I guarantee you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| I don't want to, but I do want to make a clarification that the pension board is really not done at the taxpayer's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10458)|
| 2:54:25| The pension board travel is coming from the employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| And there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| This is coming out of their retirement money, and this is not taxpayer money that's being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| I dispute that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| We put $10 million in there last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| You know, what I mean is you may be putting $10 million in, but you're also this is their pension money that we're traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| I understand, but it's taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| Well, I mean, yeah, you can say it's taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| I'm not saying it's not well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| I'm saying it's taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| It's property taxes go toward pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| Well, then, I mean, it's taxpayer dollars that's buying their homes and buying their cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| and, you know, buying their vacations to Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| But I still think that that's their money, and that's their retirement money, and it's not really the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10504)|
| 2:55:09| I mean, yeah, their homes are taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| and it's city money that has your home and your car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| and it's, you know, Medicare money maybe that buys my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| I don't know, but it's how you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| But still, I think you earned it, and I think I earned it, and I think they've earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| But that money is not coming directly from the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| Yes, I do have a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| Can we keep it short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| We've been on this for 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| I'll be happy to keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| One thing I want to point out is that the NACO annual conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| every year falls on the Monday that we have county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| We've tried to get that county commission meeting moved before, and the entire commission voted it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| That's something we want to revisit this year since some of us are required to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10547)|
