| 0:00:00| We're going to start our agenda portion of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=8)|
| 0:00:10| Yeah, we're going to miss the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| Oh, I thought we were going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=12)|
| 0:00:14| Well, there's not enough people here, so we didn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=14)|
| 0:00:16| Okay, so Lee needs to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=16)|
| 0:00:18| Oh, there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=18)|
| 0:00:20| Do you want to sit here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| He's doing the agenda first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| I've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=24)|
| 0:00:30| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=30)|
| 0:00:32| Are there any additions to the agenda that we need to know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| Thirteen people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Yes, I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| I've given a copy to Joe Lee and to Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| This is to a resolution to approve a contract with Beyond Benefits, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=49)|
| 0:00:56| which would be our COBRA administration services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=56)|
| 0:01:04| There's no objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| She has all the verbiage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Yeah, I just had a question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| I had a couple of letters, and some of you may have received these also from constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| really regarding when the records and the notes and all from our commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=83)|
| 0:01:31| you know, what we vote on and where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| when that's posted on the county's website on the Internet so they can review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| Evidently, I think from the county clerk's office, there's a several-month delay until it's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| And what this person had requested was that we at least have a draft form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| where the resolutions and the votes were put up on that sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| And I don't know if that's possible, or they don't like to do it because it's not been verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| You may want to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| The minutes run a month behind because we like for the commissioners to see them first if they have any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| And once they're approved, then we give them out to the public or whomever wants them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| Because I guess if we had a draft form that had inaccuracies in it, it could lead to a lot of misunderstandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| I guess that's why it's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| I didn't want to bring it up just because someone had requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| We definitely don't need any more misunderstandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| You don't cross a T, it just changes everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| I agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| I don't know if it's possible to just somehow get vote totals on each one up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| or do you think that would still be problematic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| They are welcome to call us, and we'll be glad to give them the vote totals, you know, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| And we have people call us after the meeting, and we give that out or a copy of the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| But so far as the minutes, we'd like for the commissioners to review them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| Well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| And I tell you, it's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| I agree with that 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I think, you know, until they're official, then they're not the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And I think it's just like the Chairman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| it could really lead to misunderstandings if there's some inaccuracies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Are there any other additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Any deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Any withdrawals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| Seeing none. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Well, Mr. Chairman. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| I think we probably need to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| We have 13 members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Let the Law Director go ahead and talk about the ordinance change so we can put that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| Before we get to that, Mr. Chairman, I did notice I think a lot of the budgetary items are on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| which I think we're going to end up setting a special meeting for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| And I don't know if this committee needs to do anything about that or will that automatically be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| We probably need to just go ahead and leave it on and see how far we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Mr. Chairman, do we need a motion to approve the agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Well, I'm going to wait and do that after we finish the ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| so we can add it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Someone can add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| And what would be a second reading of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| The first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| The second reading would be on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Well, that wouldn't be on this agenda then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| It wouldn't be on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| So we might as well just firm up the agenda and then deal with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| I think we both would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| I thought we had read or suggested that we would make this the first reading as a meeting, special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=298)|
| 0:05:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| And the 11th would be the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| But then it would not be on our regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| We're just trying to confuse you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| It's a conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| Are there any other additions, deletions, withdrawals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| I'd like a motion to accept the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Motion to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=340)|

| 0:05:47| I guess we need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=347)|

| 0:06:47| whose intention is to try to render in harmony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=407)|
| 0:06:56| in some sense of harmony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| the two ordinances that this body passed in April and May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| Ordinance 101 and 102 from April and then second reading in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| Let me go back a little bit with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| In April and May the body passed an ordinance, which was 101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=434)|
| 0:07:27| that had been recommended by Commissioners Daniels and Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| that essentially sought to restructure the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| and, in addition to restructuring the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| sought to have the Charter Review Committee report back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| County Commission for then its consideration of charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=467)|
| 0:07:56| rather than have the Charter Review Committee report directly to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| At the same time, the body passed an ordinance that had been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| by Commissioner Luthold that did not seek to change the structure of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Charter Review Committee or to whom it reported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| but rather sought to provide a little more time with respect to its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=502)|
| 0:08:31| reporting, saying not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| the Charter Review Committee would certify its results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Upon my review of these two ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| it truly struck me that they may be mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| or at least in such disharmony that if they're on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| and they are both passed by the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| it may be very difficult to determine what it is the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| is supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Is it supposed to report directly to the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| which is the way Ordinance 0084102 would have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| or is it supposed to perform its work under its restructured design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| and report back to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| which then does its work and then sends it on to the Election Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| In an effort to try to harmonize what I understood to be the intention of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=574)|
| 0:09:43| I have put together ordinance before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| which follows the restructuring that Commissioners Daniels and Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| had proposed of the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| not only in terms of membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| but also in terms of to whom it reports directly back to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| not the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| and in an effort to also harmonize the body's intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| about allowing for more time in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| which was Commissioner Luthold's goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| I have put different timetables in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| which you can see where the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| would report back to the County Commission at least 120 days prior to an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| a general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| which then would give the County Commission opportunity under the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| to determine whether or not to adopt the proposed Charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| and then which would give the Commission time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| to get those results to the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| which would then give the Election Commission time to get them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| And so what you see in this proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| is somewhat of a blending of both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| and actually a little broader timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| to try to allow for all the things that have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| 120 days to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| then the County Commission would have to provide it to the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| 70 days prior to a general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| and then that way the Election Commission could get it on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| for a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Now, it's the body's pleasure what this body wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| I also know Mr. McKay is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| and he wants to address some issues about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| It may be this body's pleasure that the body doesn't want to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| and wants to leave the two ordinances that it passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| as they are, for submission on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| My only concern was if both of the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| that the body has passed also pass with the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| there could be some confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| one, about how the Charter Review Committee is structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| and its membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| and also to whom it reports its product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| And then I don't know what that outcome would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| would be trying to harmonize those two proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| And all that was probably just really as clear as mud, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| I'd like to call on Mr. McKay if he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| I'm Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| I'm the Administrator of Elections in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| My concern is with the state law currently says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| that anything that's going to be placed on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| initiative, referendum, that the people vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| has to be in our office 60 days before the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| which is this Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| So if you're going to do something that you want to be on the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| I've got to have it in my office by Friday, this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| So there are a number of, you know, the recall petition is going to be on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| a number of other things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Now, you could always pass something after that date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| and put it on the next ballot, which would be November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| But I just want to let you know that this is the opinion of Brook Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| He's the chief election official of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| According to law, no ballot gets approved without his approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| and that's his position is that if it's not in our office 60 days before the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| then it goes on the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| So I just want you to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| And I will just tell you that the charter, as it presently reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| for amendments to the charter says 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| So it's the position of the charter that you have up until 45 days before the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| to get it on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| whether you want to take this issue on or not is this body's call as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Mary Ann, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| If we combine these two ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| do we open the opportunity for the nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| for them to possibly come back and ask us to combine any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| In other words, if we take two separate, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| They're already combining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| My understanding is, is that not against the law, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| that you cannot combine ordinances just to get them passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| I don't think that's against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| I think what we're offering this body the opportunity to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| is to try to harmonize its intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| If this body were to pass the ordinance before it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| by the language of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| this body would likewise be repealing the two ordinances it passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| on two readings there in April and May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| But, you know, it may be the desire of this body to present to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| two separate ordinances with two separate options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| I mean, I suppose that could well be the desire of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| My only concern was if that happens and if they both pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| I'm not sure how to harmonize them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Well, it sounds like, according to Greg, that we have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| I mean, we have to change the language to 60 days irregardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Well, Commissioner Luthold does just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| And the one we've proposed today does just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| The Charter, as it exists right now, still says 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| And it's always been the position of the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| that the Charter controls how the Charter is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| And if the Charter says 45 days to the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| then that's what works for getting it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| And we just disrespectfully disagree with Brooke Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| I think in a tight budget that's something legally we don't want to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Well, and you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| I guess my question is that the Charter change that I proposed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1014)|
| 0:17:03| changes it to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| The Charter change that Daniels and Davis have proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| talks about a Charter review committee, how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| And then I guess you've added language that they needed to get it back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| because that's what, by a certain amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| because that's what their proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| I guess in my mind I can see that you could get into a time crunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| if the review committee doesn't realize that they have to get it back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| in time for it to get to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| But I don't necessarily see that it's a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| because one of them just says it's got to be in there by 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and everybody just has to work with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| So I can see both of these going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Now, if there's some, if Commissioners Daniels and Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| and the rest of the Commissioners would like to maybe wait until November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| and change maybe some of the language there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and incorporate some of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| because I like some of the things you've added to that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| as far as the 120 days so that that review body has it spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1107)|
| 0:18:36| I would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| But I do think we need to get our Charter to reflect what state law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and proceed on with the 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| And that's not to try to disregard what both 4th District Commissioners are trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| because I think it's a worthy thing to put before the public and let them vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| But I do think we need to try to get our Charter in line with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| Well, and on that, as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| if this body does not do anything and does not repeal either ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| then they will both move forward and be on the ballot in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| and be submitted to the Election Commission this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| I don't see a blended ordinance that we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| but rather two ordinances or actually the one that was just created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| that was supposed to be a blended one actually embraces more than one subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| because one of them deals with restructuring and one with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| And my concern would be that there had been a possible oversight in drawing, in drafting these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1181)|
| 0:19:51| Is that the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| And that if you want to place the blame for the oversight, you may do so, and it's mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| because I drafted both of these at the request of the commission and the commission passed both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| And, frankly, we did not, nor did anyone on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| really see how they could be mutually conflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| Well, I still go back to saying that I don't know that there really is a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| I don't see that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| When you draw it out, I guess I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Mary, maybe you can help us kind of see where the conflict actually lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Which component of the two do you see that there's a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| My concern is if you look at what was Ordinance 102, which was proposed by Commissioner Leuthold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| it does not restructure the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| It still makes it the duty of the mayor to appoint it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| It has the Charter Review Committee delivering its product directly to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| And I think this is, and I apologize, Chairman Strickland, I just want to jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| I think that under Section 2, under D, that is what our ordinance is addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| and then Mr. Leuthold's ordinance really is Section E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| And so when we included Section D in his ordinance, that's where we created a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| Do you not agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| That might have been how it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Is there a way that we can tweak mine and William's to include 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| and then change Commissioner Leuthold's, both of them separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| but change Commissioner Leuthold's just to exclude Section D to where it only has the language of Section E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| You might well be able to do that, and we'd be happy to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| but you will still have to have the two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Right, but what I'm asking you is do you think that that will alleviate that conflict that you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| Will that be able to harmonize both of the ordinances that you had talked about earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1322)|
| 0:22:12| It might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Can we do that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Does everyone understand what I'm addressing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| But you still have to have two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Well, could we not have a reading today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Could we not make a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I've got an idea, and I'm not an expert at Robert's Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| but I'm thinking that if someone on the prevailing side of an issue brought it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| and asked for a reconsideration, could it then be brought back up as the second reading of the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| and then make the minor changes through an amendment, and then that would make this the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| Because if we're just talking taking that Section E out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| I think we could do that with a reconsideration and pass the second reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| And, again, I'm not an expert on this, but I think we may be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| I don't think you can do that once the meeting that it was discussed at is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| Plus, I mean, we have our obligation to have two readings of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| We also have an obligation to have that ordinance in the hands of the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| at least 48 hours prior to the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| which is what makes it somewhat difficult to be making all these oral changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| although we may be able to work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Ultimately, then, I think we're also facing this issue that Mr. McKay has brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| that Mr. Thompson says he won't put it on the ballot if it's not to the election commission by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| We respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| The first reading today of any ordinance can be followed by a second reading as early as June 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| but you have to have seven days between readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| What's the downside to voting on this in November as opposed to August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| I mean, is there a downside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I mean, the voters are going to vote anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| You're probably going to have a larger voter turnout in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| I guess my point is, is if I'm hearing Greg correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| the two ordinances that we've passed can go on the ballot and you'll accept those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| The law director is saying those two have a conflict that we could possibly get into legal ramifications on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| later on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| If we try to pass it today, Mr. McKay's position is Brooke Thompson probably will not accept it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| We could go ahead and approve it today and the 11th, send it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| If he rejects it for this one, will it automatically roll to November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| If there's no downside to doing November, I'm all in favor of voting on this language clarification today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| voting on it again the 11th, send it in, see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Because the worst that can happen would be he says, no, I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| I'll put it on in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| We're not going to sue him over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| We're not going to go to court over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| And we've accomplished the same thing, it would seem to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| Let's clarify if we could for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| So are we going to the only question then before us really is I think Commissioner Hammond is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| But I also think what's the question before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Is it do we do it in the combined form that the Assistant Law Director has presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| or do we do it in the separate as amended just by Commissioner Davis form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| I think it's probably better as the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| I think we need to have two because we're talking about really two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And to be honest with you, Commissioner Davis, when she originally proposed hers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| and I proposed mine just happened to be the same month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| and she asked me if we'd like to combine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And my first reaction was that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| But when I looked at it a little closer, I felt like they were two separate issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| and deserved to be voted on separately because mine just strictly deals with timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| whereas theirs is changing, I think, a very substantive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| And I think one is simply trying to follow state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| where the other is really trying to change how we change our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| And the public may go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| I think mine is pretty cut and dry with just trying to change our ordinance to match state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| So I would rather they be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| And I think I hear that from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Commissioner Ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| I was just going to basically say what Mike Hammond had said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| because if it doesn't go forward, then we're looking at it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| And he just sort of got ahead of me on that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| The way that I'm reading this here, when you're talking about deleting a whole section, what was it, E or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| If you look at Mr. Luth Holds, it's 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| You should have a copy of that one, of what we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| If you look at Section D, under Section 2, then D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| D deals with the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| And then Section E actually really refers to the time as to when the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Well, in Section D, there's no change, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Are we making any changes to Section D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Within my ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Within yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Within my ordinance, is there a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Section D has to do with the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| That wasn't originally part of your ordinance, was it, Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| And it was. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| That wasn't part of your ordinance originally, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I think that's what it was written in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| And it actually is the same thing that we've got in ours, I believe, is Section D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| Which is the original language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| So I guess, Ms. Law Director, since Section D, within the ordinance that I've proposed, is not a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1701)|
| 0:28:33| I don't believe there's a change within there, or is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| There is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Yes, our esteemed Assistant Jill reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Even in D, there is, because the way the Charter reads right now, it says not more than 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| It has a funny language in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Yeah, I remember we were trying to clear that up as well because there was some ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| The Charter says not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days prior to the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| next following its appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| So we were, yeah, the other thing I asked you to do was to fix that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| So I think your goal here was to make it more clear, not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days prior to a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1753)|
| 0:29:24| We were trying to make that clarification because that was a discussion back when the petition group was in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| Who could change the Charter and when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| And I was trying to fix that language as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| I guess my question, back to Mary Ann, is are we making substantial changes in what you've presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| I guess what we hear as far as corrections, that this could even be a first reading now if we slightly amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1788)|
| 0:30:00| I guess we can do anything if it's not this first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| If it's the first reading, we just start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| The point that Commissioner Lambert brought up, is there one of these that we could make a minor enough change that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| consider this as a second reading to meet the deadline of 60 days that Craig McKay has just, she says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| Could we vote to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| I don't know that that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| I don't think it's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I think Commissioner Hammond had the best ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Let's amend these as needed to where there isn't a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| Let's go ahead and do it on a first reading if we can and then on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Why don't we just change one of them instead of changing both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| That way one of them will, like we could go ahead and let Elaine's go forward and on the ballot as it's scheduled to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| and then we could amend Craig's and let it go on the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Or it may go on the ballot in August anyway, but either way it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| But if we only mess with one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Well, if we mess with either one of them, it sounds like they would go on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| I guess the question is, do we change both of them and more than likely look at a November ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1882)|
| 0:31:36| Do we leave them alone with the advice, going against the advice of our legal counsel, leaving them on the August ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1896)|
| 0:31:48| Do we want them as one ordinance or do we want them as two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| I think we definitely need to keep them as two separate ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| I think so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And, again, the reason why I was thinking if we just alter yours, state law already states we're just reinforcing state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1917)|
| 0:32:07| So your ordinance is actually already in effect because state law trumps the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| But it also changes up the ambiguity about which elections that you can make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1933)|
| 0:32:23| That was the other part of it that I asked them to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Because if you remember back when the charter people were in front of us and we had, could they, as a petition group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1945)|
| 0:32:34| change the charter in November or did they have to have it in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Could a charter review committee do it in August or November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Could we, as a commission, with two votes, put something on in August or the November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| And there was, we had sort of dueling opinions going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| And this ordinance that I proposed not only changed the time back to 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| but it also changed and got rid of the ambiguity, which was the other thing I was trying to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| And so it might be better to try to fix that ambiguity in August, if possible, to put it in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| and then come back so that you no longer have that ambiguity come in November, because we fixed that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| and then make the change to the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Because I don't foresee us having a charter review committee before November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| I think, well, I think the amendments don't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| That's what I, they probably don't make it by August anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| No, no, I'm talking about the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| You probably want, you probably want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Mary Ann, can we not make the changes today and just let it go, be it one, two, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Go ahead, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| I would like to make a motion that these go back, the law director straighten them out separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| and they go in the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| It's not going to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| I'll second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| So what was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Could you restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| For both of them to go to the law department, straighten them out separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and for both of them to go in the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Commissioner, the law director has something that needs to take, that needs to happen before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| So before you have a second, would you explain what you were saying, Mary Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Under the charter, since there have been two readings of 101 and 102, and they've been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2067)|
| 0:34:38| We have to rescind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Our office is, as we sit here today, under a duty to submit them to the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| unless this body repeals them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| So I'd like to make a friendly amendment, Mary Ann, to repeal those two with this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| Do they need to be separate votes, or can we vote them as one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| Mr. Payne, could you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| The motion, and I believe Commissioner Ballard seconded it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| was to send these back to the law director to straighten out both of them individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| and put them on the ballot for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| We're talking to Craig McKay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| He says they're not going to put them on the ballot anyway, apparently, unless we have it by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| So that's pushing too close, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Mr. Payne, we're going to do them separate so you can make a motion for the 101 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| I'd like to make that 101 to go to the law director to be straightened out and go on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| And rescind the 101 also that we had voted on prior on two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Just to clarify, Paul, I think I know where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Rescind, and we'll take them one at a time, rescind 101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| have the law director come back to us presumably at our meeting on the 11th and again at our meeting on the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| if we pass at both of those, that pretty much guarantees it goes on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| November ballot, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| So that's what we're asking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Can I ask one question, Mr. Stackhouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| I'm sorry, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| With regard to Mr. Daniels and my ordinance, the only changes that need to be made with that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| what changes do you think need to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Well, here's what finally struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Just call me Winnie the Pooh, I bear a very little brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| But what finally struck me in your and Commissioner Daniels' ordinance was we run up against the same problem that concerns Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2198)|
| 0:36:51| You see in paragraph D of your ordinance, it read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days prior to the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| next following appointment, the Charter Review Committee would certify to the county commission the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| Well, that doesn't give the county commission the necessary time to do the two readings that it has to do to put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2229)|
| 0:37:18| Indeed, if we accept Brooke Thompson's position that this matter must get to the election commission 60 days prior to the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2238)|
| 0:37:31| we really have to back this process up, which is what struck me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| which is what led to this whole 120-day, 70-day, 60-day formula that I came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| So there's a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| And indeed, in Commissioner Luthold's ordinance, for all of our hard work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| we have the same issue because paragraph D, even in Commissioner Luthold's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| still says not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days prior to a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| So if we keep Brooke Thompson's position in mind, then even in Commissioner Luthold's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| we need to get it to the election commission 60 days prior to a general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| if we believe we need to do what Brooke Thompson says he wants us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| So I think there are timing issues, frankly, in both the ordinances as passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| which I attempted to resolve in this one before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| But I did coalesce both ideas in one, and perhaps what I hear the body telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| is you'd like me to resolve the timing issues in each ordinance but keep the ordinances separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| So you would have correct timing in each, but in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| the people of Knox County would be able to vote on one kind of charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| that would report directly to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| And in the other one, they would be voting on a charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| that would report back to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Is that how you all understand where you're headed with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| No? I see Commissioner Horner shaking his head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| I guess all I'm trying to attempt to do is to fix the charter so that it meets up with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| with the timing, because we now have early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| When we passed this ordinance, it was 1988, and there wasn't such a thing as early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| So our charter needs to reflect the timing issue to give the people more time to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| and study up on an issue, but also to meet up with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| The other part of it is to try to get rid of the ambiguity with which elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| different referendum items could be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| And as long as you address those two items in a separate ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| from whatever the fourth district is trying to do, then I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| I'm fine. I mean, I'm trying to keep mine simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| One for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| And if you could accomplish that and then write something that does what Davis and Daniels are trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2417)|
| 0:40:26| then that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| That's all I'm just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| But it sounds like neither one of these ordinances are going to be able to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| and I'm going to make a substitute motion to rescind both 101 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| That's the only motion that I've got on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Yeah, but the law director said we needed to have that as a separate vote, Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and that's the only reason why I'm doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Otherwise, I could vote all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| She felt like that we needed to vote that separate and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Property moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Well, we have lights on to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| No, I was just going to call for the question because I have to leave at 2.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| so we have 15 minutes to have 13 people present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| We need a vote on a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| This is the closing vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| We'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Oposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Guys, this is a really important decision that we're about to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| and you're about to make it with no debate whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| I'm not going to vote on this in protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| We're voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| We're voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| What is the question, though, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| I mean, I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| The motion, of course, is to rescind 101 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| And then, in other words, we're just going to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Until the language is corrected to where there isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| any opportunity of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| And then they'll be brought back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| The motion is to rescind 101 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| And what the law director had told us, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| was that right now, they're sending them on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| unless we take action to rescind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| So this action just rescinds these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| And then we decide if we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| them go back and do two or one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| But are we voting now on the call to question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| We're voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Give me a gap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| No, well, it was, but there was a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| You're voting on the yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2562)|

| 0:43:00| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2580)|

| 0:43:06| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2591)|

| 0:43:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| 13 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| The motion passes, 13 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Now we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| To rescind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2621)|
| 0:43:41| Commissioner Lutho's motion to rescind 101 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| Commissioner Briggs, you have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| What I wanted to say on this, if we've called for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| do we have a discussion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| No, we have no discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| He can't discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| That's what we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| That's why I voted no, so you could discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| No, that's why I said I don't have any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Well, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Does everyone understand the motion to rescind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Because I wanted you to have your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| 14 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| 14 yes and 1 no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Just a quick question, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| You have put together one ordinance, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| combines the wording of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Now, have you accomplished what commissioners Daniel and Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| wanted to do and Commissioner Lutho in one ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Does it do what they want done with the one ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Well, I think it does, except unless I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| Commissioner Lutho to be saying today that it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| his intention to restructure the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| nor was it his intention to have the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| report back to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| but rather it was his intention to have the Charter Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Committee report directly to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| If that is Commissioner Lutho's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| then while I've combined them, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I've carried out his goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| No, my only goal is to try to clear up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| the ambiguity about when a referendum item can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| go which election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| And I want it to be both the August and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| So we need two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And I'll yield to Commissioner Pingston if you would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| your, Paul, if you would give us your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I'm yielding to you if you want to make the motion that we send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| it back to the law director for wording and put it on November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| I take 101 and to reword it, go back and put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| on the ballot in November to get it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| You're going to do both 101 and 102?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Well, she said we need to go on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| I'm going to go for 102 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| We're going to do them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| I've tried to count what we need to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I think there's three big issues that we need to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| First of all, we need to decide how the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| is nominated, elected, and what their function is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and who they report back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| That's one issue that has to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| The second issue that has to be decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| is to clear up some of the ambiguities as to whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| just in one of the local and state elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| or whether it can go on the general ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| And that's what I think that Commissioner Luthol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| is trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| The third issue deals with the days and the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| and the conflicts that have occurred with early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| And what now state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| What state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So those are the three issues that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| Because there's a conflict right now, not just with the days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| but also with how the Charter Review Committee comes about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| Is it appointed by the mayor and then voted on us by a block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Or does the mayor point some, we vote on each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| of those individually, the commission points some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| And then after the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| finishes their recommendations, where does it go back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Does it go directly to the election commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| that come back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| And that's addressed by that portion of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| that Commissioners Daniel and Davis have in Section D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| But that part also needs to be fixed about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| as what Commissioner Luthol said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| about clarifying which election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| And his intention is that it be available for both elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| both our local elections and the state elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| And I'm talking about any referendum item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| There's three ways that a referendum item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| can reach the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| And I want it clear that no matter which of those three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| it can go on either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| The next time there's a ballot and the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| there's an election, is that the amendment can go on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Yes, regardless of how it got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| As long as it's within that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| As long as it's within the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| So I think it's important to really clarify that so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| doesn't come back with, because I tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| If we pass these the way these were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| I don't know how they would look at it, is which one passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| But you've got two different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| of picking the Charter Review Committee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Well, and what we don't want is any more confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| within our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| That's all I was trying to attempt with mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| And I know that they were trying to do that with theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| But we sort of came up with something that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| Law director, I think you heard what the commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| intent in the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Can I ask Dr. Briggs to accept a position in the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| I'm satisfied making my living cutting on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Commissioner Pinkston, is everyone clear on the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| to send it back to the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| Well, we've already sent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| He'd rather literally pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| I guess we didn't do the rescind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| The rescind and to send it back to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| No, we voted to rescind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| We've got a motion on the floor and property second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| to send it to the law director now for legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| My right hand got me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| It's just to send it back to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Right, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Reword it properly and get it on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Are we all clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| I think I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| The ayes have it, 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| However many we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| We need to do 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I'd like to make a nomination, I mean a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| to do 102 exactly as we did 101, to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3034)|
| 0:50:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| On November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| We need to vote on the special call meeting for June 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| You're going to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Oh, let's just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Let's just hear it and, law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| did you explain to the other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| what you were just explaining to us about the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| I wasn't certain what the governing body's pleasure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| But if you want to have a first reading on June 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| then you need to vote to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| If, on the other hand, if you are anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| this is going on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I suppose your other option is to amend your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| and put it on the June agenda of the regular June meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| and have your first reading in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| your second reading in July, and you'll be in plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| So you're saying the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| will be finished cleaning it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| We can either have these ready for you for June 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| if you want to have a special call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| meeting for that purpose, for first reading, or since your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Well, we're already meeting on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3100)|
| 0:51:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Or if your goal, since your goal, as stated now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080604agendacalledmeeting?start=3101)|
